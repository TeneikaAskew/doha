Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guidelines F and J are not at issue in this appeal.  \n1\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 12, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April\n20, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge found that Applicant failed to provide information relevant to the processing of\nhis application for a clearance.  These omissions concerned: (1) several arrests for alcohol-related\nconduct; (2) a bankruptcy action; (3) alcohol treatments while in the Army; and (4) information\nabout delinquent debts.  Applicant was aware of his responsibility to provide the information.  He\nadmitted that he did not do so due to concern that he could lose his security clearance.  The Judge\nconcluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his deliberate\nomissions.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in finding that he had been arrested for criminal\noffenses four times during 2002.  He states that two of the incidents involved merely the issuance\nof citations rather than actual arrests.  We have examined the Judge\u2019s findings in light of the record\nas a whole.  The challenged findings are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR.  Even if\nerroneous, they are not likely to have affected the outcome of the case.  Therefore, any error is\nharmless.  See ISCR Case No. 08-07528 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009).  Considering the record\nevidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by substantial\nevidence and are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-13491 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 18, 2008).  See\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might\naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d)\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief cites to record evidence of his good work performance.  However,\na Judge is presumed to have considered all of the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-\n00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009).  Applicant\u2019s brief has not rebutted that presumption.  In support\nof his appeal, Applicant has submitted evidence not contained in the record, e.g., information\nconcerning his post-hearing conduct.  We cannot consider this new evidence.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board.\u201d)  See also ISCR\nCase No. 08-06875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009).\n\n3\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

After a complete and thorough\n1\nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \nApplicant, who is 35 years old, works as a web analyst teaching soldiers how to\nmaintain their weapons.

With\nthe assistance of the court, they developed a wage earner\u2019s payment plan. They\ncomplied with the payment terms of their plan and the court discharged their bankruptcy\nin September 2006.4\nApplicant left the Army in April 2007 and began attending college full-time. He\nused the GI Bill, his disability benefits, and unemployment benefits to pay his living\nexpenses until May 2008, when he began his current employment. His wife did not find\nemployment until more than six months after he left the military. During this time,\nApplicant lacked sufficient funds to pay all his bills. As a result, he incurred new unpaid\ndebts.5\nAfter reviewing the credit reports dated January 8, 2005, June 18, 2008, May 10,\n2009, February 4, 2010, February 8, 2010, March 17, 2010, and the SOR, I have\ncompiled a list of the total debts owed, excluding any duplicate entries. I find that\nAppellant\u2019s actual debts are as follows:6\nSOR \u00b6\nType of Debt\nAmount\nStatus \nEvidence\n1.a\nMedical bill\n$  2,554.00\nDisputed, removed\ncredit report\nAE B; AE C; AE J\n1.b\nPublic Works\n$     316.00\nPaid\nAE I; AE J\n1.c\nCable bill\n$     212.00\nDisputed; Paid\nGE 8 at 5; AE K;\nTr. 35-37\n1.d\nBank credit card\n$     625.00\nPaid\nAE C; AE J at 24;\nAE N\n1.e\nMedical bill\n$     165.00\nPaid\nAE C; AE D; AE J\nat 26\n1.f\nCredit account\n$  2,028.00\nDisputed, removed\ncredit report\nAE B; AE C; AE J;\nTr. 40\n1.g\nBank card\n$     984.00\nPaid\nAE B; AE C; AE G;\nAE J at 21-22; AE\nM; Tr. 41 \n\nGE 10; AE H; AE L; AE O; AE P; Tr. 41-42.\n7\nGE 8; AE B; AE C; AE J; At the hearing, Applicant objected to the submission of a court record showing a\n8\njudgment on the grounds that he was not the individual against whom the judgment had been obtained\nbecause he did not have a middle name or initial.

Applicant began paying the smaller SOR\ndebts in June 2009 and had resolved many of these debts by the hearing date. He\ndeveloped a repayment plan for his largest debt, made his first payment in December\n2009, and has made three additional monthly payments. He plans to increase his\nmonthly payment to $400 in June 2010 after paying other debts. His personal financial\nstatement indicated that his household net income totals $4,713 and his monthly\nexpenses total approximately $4,500. His net remainder is $213. He estimated many of\nhis monthly expenses. He has sufficient income to meet his expenses.7\nApplicant challenged the validity of four debts listed in the SOR. He did not retain\na copy of his challenge a year ago to three debts. These three debts have been\nremoved from his credit reports, which also reflect a dispute about another debt not\nlisted in the SOR. The disputed debts listed in SOR allegations 1.a and 1.f are shown\non the May 10, 2009 and June 18, 2008 credit reports with a date of last activity in\n2007. Applicant believes that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m is the same as the debt\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. He has not provide sufficient proof that these debts are the same.8\nApplicant credibly testified that he now understands that his debts must be paid\nand that good credit is important. He talks with the soldiers he trains and with his\nchildren about debts and credit.9\n\nGE 4.\n10\nGE 3; GE 5; GE 6; GE 10; Tr. 51-53.\n11\nTr. 51.\n12\n5\nCriminal Conduct\nOn February 25, 2001, the police arrested and charged Applicant with driving\nwhile impaired (DWI) after the arresting officer observed Applicant weaving in the road.\nThe police officer administered a breathalyzer test, which showed a .18 level of alcohol.\nThe state trial court dismissed the charges and fined Applicant $50. The state police\nreported his arrest to the military base where he was assigned. The Army prepared and\nsubmitted a report to his command. The Army suspended his post driving privileges for\none year.10\nIn 2002, the police arrested Applicant on four occasions. The police first arrested\nApplicant on January 17, 2002, charging him with driving while license revoked and a\nwindow tinting violation. The court dismissed these charges seven months later. On\nJanuary 25, 2002, the police arrested Applicant on a second DWI charge, plus charges\nfor driving while license revoked and civil revocation of driver\u2019s license. Applicant\nbelieved his original trial date occurred when he had been deployed out-of-state on\ntraining. He did not appear for the first court date as he thought his attorney had\nresolved the matter of his appearance. On April 17, 2002 the police charged him with\ndriving while licensed revoked and a window tinting violation. The court dismissed these\ncharges a year later. On November 7, 2002 the police arrested and charged him with a\nfailure to appear on his January 2002 DWI arrest and other charges. In December 2002,\nthe court dismissed all charges related to his January 2002 and November 2002\narrests. Although the Army received notice of the failure to appear arrest, Applicant\u2019s\ncommand took no disciplinary action against him.11\nThe Army transferred Applicant to another base in a different state by 2005. In\nMarch 2005, the military police at his new base arrested Applicant for DWI. He pled no\ncontest to the charges. The magistrate\u2019s court sentenced him to probation before\njudgment, fined him $250, placed him on probation for 18 months, directed community\nservice, and ordered an alcohol evaluation. Applicant attended the alcohol education,\nbut did not complete the program as he appeared one day with alcohol on his breath.12\n The state police arrested Applicant for DWI on September 4, 2006. Applicant\npled guilty to the DWI charge and the prosecutor nolled prossed the driving on a\nsuspended out-of-state license charge. On April 5, 2007, the court sentenced him to\none year in jail, with 11 months suspended, and fined him $145. Applicant served one\nmonth in jail, which he described as a wake-up call. He realized he did not want to\nreturn to jail and decided not to drink alcohol. He also promised his family he would stop\nconsuming alcohol and has kept his promise. He consumed his last alcoholic beverage\n\nGE 10; GE 11; Tr. 44-50.\n13\nAfter two years, assuming the Army needs soldiers with his qualifications, he could re-enlist. Tr. 81-82.\n14\nGE 10; Tr. 80-82\n15\n6\nin April 2007. The police cited him for driving with a suspended license and violation of\nlicense restriction in January 2007. The court dismissed the citation.13\nFollowing this DWI arrest and trial, the Army reviewed Applicant\u2019s past records\nregarding his drinking and other arrests. The Army concluded that Applicant had a\npattern of misconduct. Applicant waived his right to a hearing in return for an honorable\ndischarge and the associated benefits, which he received in April 2007.  Although his\n14\nmilitary career ended, Applicant opined that the time in jail changed his life. He is\ngrateful that this experience happened. He made positive lifestyle changes and learned\nfrom the experience.15\nPersonal Conduct\nWhen Applicant completed his e-QIP in May 2008, he answered \u201cno\u201d to the\nfollowing questions:\n1.\nSection 23d. Police record: have you ever been charged with or convicted\nof any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\n2.\nSection 25. Use of alcohol: In the last 7 years, have your use of alcoholic\nbeverages resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling (such\nas for alcohol abuse or alcoholism)?\n3.\nSection 27a. Your Financial Record: In the last 7 years, have you filed a\npetition under any chapter of the bankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13)?\n4.\nSection 28 a. Your financial Record: In the last 7 years, have you been\nover 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\n5.\nSection 28b. Your Financial Record: Are you currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\nApplicant admitted that he failed to provide information about his arrests, his\nbankruptcy, his alcohol treatment programs while in the Army, his Chapter 13\nbankruptcy, and his finances. He acknowledged that he knew he needed to provide this\ninformation because he had completed security clearance applications while in the Army\nand that his past conduct and his finances could result in a denial of a security\nclearance. In his response to interrogatories, Applicant stated that he did not list his\nbankruptcy filed in December 2001, as it had been filed more than seven years before\nhe completed his e-QIP. At the hearing, he stated that since his bankruptcy had been\n\nGE 10; Tr. 59-61.\n16\nGE 10; Tr. 84-91.\n17\nId.\n18\nGE 6; Tr. 83.\n19\n7\ndischarged, he did not think he needed to list it. He stated that he had no explanation for\nhis failure to list his debts or alcohol treatment. He stated that he was afraid of losing his\njob and decided not to provide truthful answers. He felt he could explain his situation in\nperson when he met with the investigator, giving the investigator an opportunity to\nevaluate him as a changed person.  \n16\nApplicant met with a security investigator on July 16, 2008. They discussed his\nfinances, his traffic violations, his bankruptcy, and his alcohol-related arrests through\nMarch 2005. The interview summary contains no information about Applicant\nconsuming alcohol on duty with the Army in November 24, 2006 (actual date November\n21, 2006) or his DWI arrest on September 4, 2006. The investigator did not confront him\nwith this information and he did not volunteer any information on these incidents during\nthe interview. Shortly after this meeting, he recalls receiving papers and listing his 2006\nDWI, although the record does not contain any reference to this information.17\nBefore it issued the SOR, DOHA mailed interrogatories to Applicant. Applicant\nsubmitted an answer with attachments on June 4, 2009. His attachments included a\nreport from the Army about his participation in the Army\u2019s alcohol and substance abuse\nprograms (ASAP). This report mentioned that his \u201cSM BAT\u201d on November 21, 2006 was\n.04 when he was on duty. Applicant denies consuming alcohol on duty, but admits that\nhe drank heavily one night before going to work and that when he arrived at work in the\nmorning, his command smelled alcohol on his breath. His command performed a\nbreathalyzer test and the results showed a .04 alcohol level. Applicant listed his\nSeptember 2006 DWI arrest, provided a copy of the court docket sheet, and listed his\nJanuary 2007 citation.18\nApplicant denied receiving a citation for a window tinting violation on March 31,\n2004 and June 17, 2004. The court records reflected that he received a citation on each\ndate and that the prosecutor voluntarily dismissed the citation. He also received a\nsimilar citation on August 6, 2005. Applicant explained that when he first had his car\nwindows tinted, it was not illegal. The laws changed, but he did not have the tinting\nremoved even after his first citation. At that time, he thought himself invincible, which he\nnow knows is not true. He finally had the tinting removed. He drove on a suspended\nlicense because he did not want others to know that his licence had been suspended.19\nIn his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant stressed that he has\nchanged his behavior and fully understand how he should have and must conduct\nhimself. He acknowledges his past \u201cmissteps\u201d and accepts full responsibility for his\nbehavior. He states that he was not making any excuses for his behavior. In summing\n\nTr. 67-68.\n20\n8\nup his conduct, he states that it took him awhile, may be too long, but \u201cI finally got the\nmessage\u201d. He is taking his life in a better direction.  \n20\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \n\n9\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in 2001. After\ncompleting their payment plan and the discharge of their debts in 2006, Applicant and\nhis wife incurred additional unpaid debts, which he was unable to pay for a period of\ntime. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial problems\nhave been ongoing for a long time and continue to the present. This mitigating condition\nis not applicable.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ After he completed his\nbankruptcy payment plan and the court discharged his debts, Applicant received an\nhonorable discharge from the Army and returned to the civilian workforce. He attended\nschool full-time while he sought full-time employment, which took a year. His wife did\nnot find employment for six months. He received unemployment benefits and $674 in\ndisability benefits, as well as money under the GI bill for his education. His income was\ninsufficient to cover all his bills during his year of unemployment. His ability to find a job\ntook a year, a factor beyond his control. Since returning to work two years ago, he has\n\nAG \u00b6 20(f) is not applicable in this case.\n21\n10\nworked towards the resolution of his debts. He did not incur unnecessary debts during\nthe year he did not work. He simply could not pay all his expenses. This mitigating\ncondition partially applies in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not received financial\ncounseling for his new debt situation. However, Applicant paid eight of the debts listed\non the SOR. He pays monthly on his largest debt. He did not pay an $84 debt, as he\nthought this debt was part of another. He has made strong strides in resolving his\nunpaid debts. His current bills are under control. This mitigating condition applies as his\nfinancial issues are resolved and under control.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant\ncontacted the creditor for the largest debt listed in the SOR. He developed a payment\nplan for this debt and has made the required monthly payments since December 2009.\nThis mitigating condition applies to SOR allegation 1.k.\nIf an \u201cindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d, security\nconcerns may be mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(e). After receiving the interrogatories listing\nall the debts which raised a concern about his finances, Applicant began an\ninvestigation. He disputed four of these debts with the credit reporting agencies.\nAlthough he provided proof of one dispute, the removal of the other three debts from his\ncredit reports is the result of his challenges because the debts are recent, would not\nhave automatically dropped off his credit reports for age, and his credit reports reflect\nanother unresolved disputed debt. This mitigating condition applies to SOR allegations\n1.a, 1.f, and 1.h.21\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and\n\n11\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nThe police arrested and charged Applicant with DWI on multiple occasions\nbetween February 2001 and September 2006. During this same period of time, the\npolice charged him with driving without a driver\u2019s license, window tinting violations,\nviolations of license restriction, and expired registration or tags. The police also arrested\nhim on a failure to appear warrant. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply in this case.\nUnder AG \u00b6 32, the following conditions may mitigate security concerns in this\ncase:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nApplicant drank alcohol to excess. His alcohol consumption resulted in four DWI\narrests. Until his last arrest in September 2006 and subsequent time in jail, the court\nsystem and the Army did not significantly penalized him for his behavior. He not only\ncontinued to drink, but he felt empowered to violate other rules, such as driving on a\nsuspended license and window tinting. His behavior lead to his discharge from the\nArmy. After spending a month in jail, Applicant realized he needed to change his\nbehavior as he did not want to return to jail. He stopped drinking alcohol three years\nago. As a result, he has not been arrested for any misconduct. He changed his attitude\nand his behavior. As he said at the hearing, \u201cI finally got the message.\u201d He works\ntowards improving his behavior and has kept his promise to his family about not drinking\nalcohol. He has mitigated the security concerns about his past criminal conduct.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n12\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of\nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information,\nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information:\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and,\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer's time or resources.\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his\nanswer must be deliberate. Applicant admitted that he deliberately falsified his answers\non his e-QIP. In light of his admission, the Government has established its case under\nthis disqualifying condition as to SOR allegations 3.a, 3.b ,3.c, 3.d., and 3.e\n.\nUnder AG \u00b6 16(b), Applicant must have deliberately provided false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant facts to the security investigator during their interview.\nApplicant clearly did not advise the security investigator during their July 2008 meeting\nabout his DWI arrest in 2006. He was well aware of this arrest. The Government has\nestablished this disqualifying condition as to SOR allegation 3.f.\n\n13\nSOR \u00b6 3.g alleges that Applicant drank on duty based on a sentence in the\nsummary report of Applicant\u2019s substance abuse treatment. Applicant denies drinking\nalcohol while on duty, but freely admits that he consumed alcohol in such a quantity the\nnight before he reported to duty on November 24, 2006 that when he reported to duty at\n6:30 a.m, his superiors smelled alcohol on his breath and ordered a breathalyzer test.\nThis allegation is not established as Applicant did not drink alcohol on duty, but before\nhe arrived for duty. SOR allegation 3.g is found in favor of Applicant.  \nThe record contains many incidents where Applicant failed to follow the rules of\nthe road and laws. Once he learned that it was against the law to drive with tinted\nwindows, he decided to ignore the legal requirements and continued to drive his car\nwith tinted windows, resulting in several citations. He drove his car when his driver\u2019s\nlicense had been suspended because he did not want anyone to know that his license\nhad been suspended. Driving while intoxicated violated the criminal laws, and in doing\nso, Applicant showed a disregard for the welfare of the general public. AG \u00b6 16(d)(4)\napplies to SOR allegations 3.h, 3.i, 3.j, and 3.k.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns and the\nfollowing may be applicable in this case:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nIn 2007, Applicant realized his alcohol consumption was having a negative effect\non his life. He made a conscious decision to stop drinking alcohol and to change his\nbehavior. Since then, he has not consumed any alcohol, has complied with the rules of\nthe road and driving laws, and has not been arrested for any reason. He had the tinting\nremoved from his car windows. He understands that his past conduct was wrong and\ncorrected both his behavior and attitude. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns\nin allegations 3.h, 3.i, 3.j and 3.k under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e). \nWhen Applicant met with the security investigator in July 2008, he did not raise\nthe issue of his 2006 DWI arrest and the investigator did not present any evidence to\nhim concerning this arrest. A DOHA adjudicator mailed Applicant interrogatories\nsometime in April or May 2009. The criminal conduct section of the interrogatories lists\nfour DWIs between 1995 and 2005. In his answer, Applicant listed his 2006 DWI and his\nJanuary 2007 charge of driving with a suspended license. Until it received Applicant\u2019s\ninterrogatory answers, the Government was unaware of his 2006 DWI arrest. Because\n\n14\nApplicant corrected the omission of this information on his own volition and before being\nconfronted with the facts of his arrest by the investigator or at the hearing, I find that his\nresponse reflects an effort by him to correct the facts. Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns in allegation 3.f under AG \u00b6 17(a).\nApplicant, however, has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his\ndeliberate falsification of five questions in his e-QIP. Applicant knew he was falsifying\nhis answers. His fear of losing his job, wanting the investigator to know him personally,\nand stating his bankruptcy had been discharge so he did not need to list it are\ninsufficient reasons to mitigate security concerns, as he understood the need to provide\nthis information from his past experience with the security application process.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is less substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. In assessing\nan Applicant\u2019s mitigation under the whole-person, the Appeal Board provided the\nfollowing guidance in evaluating Guideline F cases in ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3\n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008):\n\n15\nthe Board has previously noted that the concept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track\nrecord\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through\npayment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. BD.\nMar. 1, 200). However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to\nestablish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. BD. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is\nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u201c. . . established a\nplan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to\nimplement that plan.\u201d See, e.g.,ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJul. 6, 2006). The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an\napplicant\u2019s financial situation and his actions in evaluating the extent to\nwhich that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding\nindebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a)(\u201cAvailable,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is\nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on outstanding debts\nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may\nprovide for the payment of such debts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no\nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable\ndebt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.\nApplicant and his wife complied with the terms of their bankruptcy payment plan.\nThey incurred bills after Applicant left from the Army and did not immediately find\nemployment. His arrest for DWI necessitated the need for an attorney and the\nassociated legal fees, which impacted his ability to pay his other bills. Applicant has\nassumed responsibility for his unpaid debts. He has resolved all the SOR debts, except\nfor one small $84 debt. He developed a payment plan for his largest debt, and given his\npositive track record while in bankruptcy, he will continue to pay this debt as long as he\nis gainfully employed. He paid some debts before the SOR was issued and some just\nbefore his hearing. He successfully challenged several debts which he did not believe\nhe owed. He has shown that he is being responsible for his old debts and his current\nexpenses. His old debts cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of course,\nthe issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid: it is whether his financial\ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. While his\nlargest debt remains unpaid in full, he has a payment plan. This debt is insufficient to a\nraise security concern. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct arises from a time when he drank alcohol to excess.\nHis time in jail changed his attitude about drinking alcohol. He no longer consumes any\nalcohol, and as a result, he has not been arrested for any criminal conduct in over three\nyears. Likewise, he no longer violates the rules of the road and other laws related to the\nuse of a motor vehicle. Even though he ignored certain civil and criminal rules, the\nrecord contains no evidence that he ever violated the rules and procedures for handling\nclassified information. He has matured and moved his life in a new direction. His change\nin attitude and behavior has resulted in a more positive lifestyle.\n\n16\nWith all that Applicant has done to correct his past mistakes, his decision to\nprovided false information on his e-QIP in 2008 reflects a  serious lapse in judgment. He\nknew he needed to provide all information, including negative information, when he\ncompleted his e-QIP, as he had filled out security clearance applications in the past. His\nreasons for doing so, fear of losing his job and wanting the investigator to know him\nthrough a personal interview, do not mitigate his intentional falsification of his e-QIP. He\nknows he what he did was wrong. Even with this knowledge, questions about his\njudgment remain. I find that he had not mitigated all of the Government\u2019s security\nconcerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances and criminal conduct,\nbut he has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nFor Applicant\n\n17\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.k:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant, 32 years old, married in February 2000 and separated in about January 2008. As a result, she is now the sole provider for herself and her 19-month-old child. She attended community college from 1997 to 1999, but did not earn a degree. She did receive a Phlebotomy Technician certificate from a vocational center in 2004. Since 2000, she has been employed by a defense contractor. On her security clearance application, she indicated her position title as \u201csupply chain\u201d (Items 4; 5). The SOR alleges debts that amount to approximately $12,000. Ten of the 16 SOR allegations relate to medical debts, totaling $987. These debts became delinquent between 2002 and 2007 (Item 6).

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the guideline for financial \nconsiderations. Accordingly, her request for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 26, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance required as part of her \nemployment with a defense contractor (Item 5). After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \nOn February 13, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) (Item 1), that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \nJune 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nthe Directive under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG). \n \nApplicant received the SOR on February 23, 2009. She signed a notarized \nAnswer on March 20, 2009, and requested a decision without a hearing. In her Answer, \nApplicant admitted to all allegations in the SOR. On April 1, 2009, DOHA Department \nCounsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM)2 in support of the government\u2019s \npreliminary decision to deny Applicant's request to be granted a security clearance. \nApplicant was given 30 days from the date she received the FORM to respond. The file \ndoes not include a response from the Applicant. The case was assigned to me on June \n12, 2009, for an administrative decision based on the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, 32 years old, married in February 2000 and separated in about \nJanuary 2008. As a result, she is now the sole provider for herself and her 19-month-old \nchild. She attended community college from 1997 to 1999, but did not earn a degree. \nShe did receive a Phlebotomy Technician certificate from a vocational center in 2004. \nSince 2000, she has been employed by a defense contractor. On her security clearance \napplication, she indicated her position title as \u201csupply chain\u201d (Items 4; 5).  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges debts that amount to approximately $12,000. Ten of the 16 \nSOR allegations relate to medical debts, totaling $987. These debts became delinquent \nbetween 2002 and 2007 (Item 6). Applicant's largest debt, $9,951, stems from \nrepossession of her car. She states that this car was in her name \u201cbecause of credit,\u201d \nbut that her former husband was the primary user, and \u201che let [it] go back on purpose.\u201d \nAs of September 2008, this account had been charged off (Item 7). The SOR also \nincludes two communications accounts (cell phone and cable service), which became \ndelinquent in 2004 and 2006, respectively, and three charge accounts, which became \ndelinquent in 2007 and 2008 (Items 1; 4; 6; 7).  \n \n \nApplicant's Answer contains limited information about the cause of her \ndelinquencies. She refers to a divorce \u201cwhich has left me unable to afford all of the bill[s] \nwhich was just left on me to handle all by myself.\u201d (Item 4). She did not provide the date \nof her divorce. In her Answer, Applicant also refers to surgery and related therapy, but \ndoes not explain the time frame, the cost, or the effect of this medical situation on her \nfinances. She notes in her Answer that she expected these medical debts to be paid by \nher insurance company, but fails to offer any further explanation. The record is also \n \n2 See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included eight documents (Items 1 - 8) proffered \nin support of the government\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nsilent as to Applicant's annual income or monthly net remainder after meeting expenses \nand debts. \n. \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in March 2009 \u201cto try and get from \nunder some of the debts that I have incurred and left with over the past years.\u201d (Items 4; \n8). Before filing the petition, Applicant was required to obtain credit counseling. The \npetition indicates that she received this information, as well as assistance with creating \na budget analysis (Item 8). The document does not provide information about \nApplicant's assets or liabilities, but does list the creditors included in the petition. Four \ncreditors listed in the SOR are included in the bankruptcy (allegations 1.d., 1.m., 1.o., \nand 1.p.). The petition also lists four medical creditors, but it cannot be determined \nwhether or not they are the medical creditors listed in the SOR.  \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-sense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).3 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors \nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative \nof a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines \nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent \npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this \ncase, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require consideration \nof the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest4 for an Applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.5 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the  \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the \n \n3 Directive. 6.3. \n \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may \nlead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that \ncannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \nThe evidence contained in the FORM shows that Applicant\u2019s debts, amounting to \napproximately $12,000, started becoming delinquent in 2002, and have remained \nunpaid. There is no evidence that Applicant engaged in frivolous spending, that she \nfailed to pay taxes, or that her debts are linked to gambling, drugs or alcohol. However, \nher seven-year history of failing to meet her financial obligations does support \napplication of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b619 (a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts) and AG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following conditions that can potentially mitigate security \nconcerns are relevant:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;  \n \n \n6 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant had numerous debts. Although \nthey started accruing in 2002, they are not in the distant past, because her debts \nremained unpaid. Although Applicant is presently attempting to resolve her debts \nthrough bankruptcy; however, without further information, such as her income and \nexpenses, it is impossible to know whether she will be able to remain debt-free in the \nfuture. Moreover, the fact that Applicant did not respond to her delinquencies until she \nreceived the SOR casts doubt on her good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot be applied. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is relevant because Applicant has been separated since 2008, and \nhas been going through a divorce, a condition that she could not have predicted. \nConsequently, she has been the sole support of herself and her child for more than one \nyear. However, most of her debts became delinquent between 2002 and 2007, while \nshe was married. Therefore, it appears that her divorce was not the primary factor that \ncaused her delinquencies. To be applicable, this mitigating condition requires that the \nperson act responsibly under the circumstances. The record provides no facts on which \nto base a determination that Applicant acted responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition (Item 8) indicates that she received financial \ncounseling, implicating AG \u00b6 20(c). However, no information is available in the record to \ndetermine what type of counseling she received, if she benefited from it, if she adhered \nto any budget that she may have developed to fulfill the pre-bankruptcy requirement, or \nif she received any other counseling that would help her to avoid a similar situation in \nthe future. AG \u00b6 20(c) cannot be applied.  \n \n \nMitigation is also unavailable under AG \u00b6 20(d). The record contains no evidence \nthat Applicant paid any of the debts in the SOR since they became delinquent, including \nthe relatively small medical debts. Applicant seeks to resolve her debts through \nbankruptcy. Although this is a legitimate avenue for dealing with unresolved debt, it \ndoes not demonstrate a track record of paying and resolving legitimate financial \nobligations.7 The extent to which the SOR debt will be resolved is unclear, because only \nfour of the SOR debts can be identified in the petition. In addition, the bankruptcy \nprocess is not complete; at this point, it is unknown whether or not it will be discharged.8 \nFinally, Applicant filed the petition shortly after she received the SOR, indicating that \nshe was responding to the security process, rather than a initiating a good-faith effort to \nmeet her legitimate financial obligations. None of the mitigating conditions apply. I find \nagainst the Applicant on Guideline F. \n \n \n7 See ISCR Case No. 02-06703 (App. Bd. Feb 25, 2004). \n \n8 See ISCR Case No. 02-21045 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2004). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited Guideline. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence Applicant is 46 years old and \npresumed to be a mature, responsible adult.  \n \nApplicant accrued approximately $12,000 in delinquent debt, starting in 2002. She filed \na Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in March 2009, about one month after she received the \nSOR. However, between 2002 and 2009, she took no steps to resolve her \ndelinquencies. A fair and common-sense assessment of the available information \nbearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows she has not satisfied \nthe doubts raised by her failure to respond to her legitimate financial obligations. Such \ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the government.9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.p.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto allow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \n_\n \nRITA C.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn June 8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 16, 2009, and elected to have her case\ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on August 14, 2009, and submitted information within the 30 days\npermitted to respond.  The case was assigned to me on October 19, 2009.   Based\nDecember 31, 2009\n\n2\nupon a review of the case file,  pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated 25 delinquent\ndebts, exceeding $17,000, in the following SOR paragraphs:1.a ($542);1.b ($120); 1.c\n($316);1.d ($99);1.e ($729); 1.f ($40); 1.g ($943); 1.h ($57); 1.I ($197); 1.j ($652); 1.k\n($2,223); 1.l ($7,898); 1.m ($800); 1.n ($127); 1.o ($19); 1.p ($656); 1.q ($121); 1.r\n($.1,155); 1.s ($276); 1.t ($89); 1.u ($656); 1.v ($45); 1.w ($43); 1.x ($73); and 1.y\n($82).  \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the alleged debts.  She\ndenied responsibility only for the debts listed in subparagraphs creditors 1.l and 1.v.\nShe claimed she paid these debts in full. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 26-year-old entry-level financial manager for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant was born on a foreign military installation to an active-duty Air Force\nservice member and a foreign national (see Items 3 and 11).  She was raised in a\npopulous state and attended local schools (ex. 11).  In May 2002 (at the age of 19), she\nwent to work to support herself and her family.  Records show that between May 2002\nand September 2002 she was employed by a private company as a production worker.\nFor the ensuing two years (between September 2002 and May 2004), she was\nemployed in a management position for a local food service company (see ex. 3). \nIn April 2006, Applicant was employed by a temporary service as a supervising\nfinancial specialist, and then leading accounting technician for a DoD financial\naccounting services agency. She was unemployed again for about six months between\nJuly 2007 and January 2008, and survived on basic subsistence.  Since August 2008,\nshe has been employed as an entry-level  financial manager for a DoD contractor (see\nItem 3).       \nApplicant married in July 2003 at the age of 20 and has three children from this\nmarriage, ages 1, 8, and 10 (see Items 4 and 5).  She divorced her husband in July\n2007 (see Item 1), and has shared joint custody with her ex-husband since their\nseparation in 2005.  As a result of their joint custody arrangements, Applicant has never\nreceived child support from her ex-husband.  Applicant\u2019s eldest child currently resides\nwith her aunt and uncle for part of the year (Item 5). \n\n3\nDuring her marriage, Applicant provided most of the financial support for her\nfamily.  Her husband had a difficult time holding a job and never contributed much to\nthe family\u2019s financial needs.  By most accounts, Applicant was the only regular working\nmember of her household and incurred most of the family\u2019s debts in her name.       \nApplicant separated from her husband in June 2005, after she learned of his\naffair with another woman (see Items 5 and 11 and response to FORM).  The affair hurt\nher considerably, and the divorce process that followed caused her a good deal of\nstress. \nProviding most of the financial support for her ex-husband and their three\nchildren since they established a joint household together in 2000, Applicant became\nvery upset over her ex-husband\u2019s disposition for accumulating credit card debts before\ntheir marriage, and not paying them.  Applicant assumed these debts as well as her\nown debts, and by the time they married in July 2003, she had paid off her ex-\nhusband\u2019s pre-marriage credit card debts (ex. 11).  Once married, Applicant opened all\nof their accounts in her name exclusively, including their apartment, utilities, and all of\ntheir other household expense items.  Her ex-husband declined to share any of their\nhousehold debts, or medical expenses associated with the treatment of their young\nson.           \nWhile still married to her ex-husband, Applicant enrolled in a local community\ncollege.  She attended this community college from July 2005 through September 2005.\nShe financed her semester\u2019s expenses with a student loan (see Item 11). Due to\ninjuries she incurred from an auto accident during the semester, she could not attend\nclasses for an extended period.  Her class absences created academic difficulties for\nher, and she was forced to withdraw from school (Item 11). Records show she attended\nclasses at another college between March 2007 and May 2007, and returned to the\nsame community college for two months between April 2008 and May 2008 (Item 11).   \nAs a part of their November 2007 divorce agreement, Applicant agreed to be\nresponsible for her student loan, her Visa account in her name (approximately $1,200),\nand her overdraft  fees on her own bank account (Item 11).  In turn, her ex-husband\nassumed sole responsibility for the accumulated medical bills associated with the birth\nof their youngest child (around $2,000).     \nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband never paid his agreed share of their accrued marriage\ndebts.  As a signatory on the accounts, Applicant has had to bear the responsibility for\npaying these debts that her ex-husband defaulted on. Because of her unemployment\nexperiences, she has struggled to keep up with all of her accrued delinquencies. Credit\nreports list accumulated delinquent debts exceeding $17,000. \nApplicant has worked with credit counseling firms to arrange workable payment\nplans with her limited income sources, but has not been able to meet the established\npayment schedules set for her.  Still, she has been able to document the payment of\n\n4\ntwo of her listed creditors (creditors 1.l and 1.v), and has established contact with most\nof her remaining creditors.  Based on her personal research of the debts listed in her\ncreditor reports, she claims two of them are duplicates (creditors 1.p and 1.u). Her\nclaims appear to be well founded and are accepted. \nAsked to identify all of her listed debts in her credit reports, Applicant could\nidentify some, but not all of her listed debts.  With her current job (if she can retain it),\nshe expects to be able to repay the remaining $9,000 in delinquent accounts within two\nyears (see response to FORM).  Most of these remaining listed debts involve medical\ncharges associated with her son\u2019s treatment, which her insurance carriers failed to pay\n(see Item 11 and response to FORM).  Without any assistance from her ex-husband,\nApplicant assures she will pay these bills as well, once she returns to work.  \nApplicant is well regarded by her supervisors and (see response to FORM).  One\nformer manager described Applicant as an outstanding accounting technician, and an\nemployee who displays excellent team-building skills and professional relationships. He\ncredits her with maintaining high ethics and standards                                        \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many\nof the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c)\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n5\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the\nDirective requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\n\n6\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a meritorious entry-level financial manager of current and prior\ndefense contractors  who accumulated a number of delinquent debts during a difficult\nmarriage between 2003 and 2007. Forced to support her entire family while balancing\nschooling pursuits, she fell behind with not only her own debts, but her ex-husband\u2019s\ndebts as well.  Her accumulation of delinquent debts and her past inability to satisfy\nthese debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b619(c) \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable primarily to her shouldering all of her family\u2019s\nfinancial responsibilities out of necessity during her marriage, while caring for her\nchildren, attending college.  She managed to stay abreast of her bills, even her ex-\nhusband\u2019s, but fell behind in her payments during recurrent periods of unemployment.\nShe has been able to resolve several of her largest accrued bills (including the $7,898\ndebt owed to creditor 1.l), and is committed to paying the balance of her bills once she\nreturns to work.  While most of the remaining listed debts remain unsatisfied, they are\nsmall enough to resolve once she returns to full time employment with her prospective\ndefense employer. \nBased on the documented materials in the FORM, extenuating circumstances\nassociated with Applicant\u2019s inability to pay of or otherwise resolve her debts are amply\nshown.  Available to Applicant is MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation, and the individual acted responsibly.\u201d\n                                         \nHolding a security clearance does involve a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of\ntrust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those\ntypically imposed on Government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\nGovernment business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is\nrequired precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While\n\n7\nthe principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are also explicit in\nfinancial cases. Failure of any applicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve\nhis debts when able to do so raises security-significant concerns about whether the\napplicant has demonstrated the trust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified\ninformation.\n In Applicant\u2019s case, she recognizes her fiducial responsibilities and her need\nto maintain responsible control over her finances.  She commits  to resolving her\ndebts as soon as she is financially able to do so.\nWhole-person assessment enables Applicant to surmount the judgment\nquestions raised by her accumulation of delinquent debts. Since her finalized divorce\nfrom her ex-husband, she has shown considerable effort in addressing her debts and\nhas managed to eliminate two of her listed debts this past year: one for $7,898 and\nthe other for $45.  She has provided exemplary service to her employers (past and\npresent), and has continued to address her debts in the face of experienced adversity.\nShe acknowledges that resolution of her remaining delinquent accounts is a critical\nprerequisite to her regaining control of her  finances, and she is determined to pay all\nof them (save for the claimed duplicate debt covered by subparagraph 1.u) once she\nreturns to work.\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s promise to pay off debts in the future, the\nAppeal Board has placed a good deal of emphasis on the applicant\u2019s ability to\nestablish a \u201cmeaningful track record.\u201d   See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.\nMay 21, 2008). This established track record does not mean, though, that an\napplicant is required, as a matter of law, to establish that he or she has paid off each\nand every debt listed in the SOR.  Under this requirement, an applicant need only\ndemonstrate that he or she has \u201cestablished a plan to resolve [her] financial problems\nand taken significant actions to implement the plan.\u201d  See id. \nUnder the facts presented, Applicant has not only established a reasonable\nplan to resolve her listed debts, but she has paid some of them and committed herself\nto paying the others seasonably once she returns to work.  Her good-faith efforts meet\nthe action plan requirements developed by the Appeal Board.   \nTaking into account all of the documented facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, her concerted efforts to resolve them with her limited\nresources, and her documented payment of two of her largest debts, Applicant is able\nto carry her evidentiary burden and mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns.\nFavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.y.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the 2(a) factors enumerated in the AGs.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):  FOR APPLICANT\n   \nSubparas. 1.a through 1.y:\n                 For Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), which he signed on July 16, 2008. After reviewing the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \nSeptember 25, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                                                                                                                           \n \n \nOn April 9, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) that \nspecified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive under \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 Applicant \nreceived the SOR on April 16, 2009. He signed his notarized Answer on April 27, 2009, \nin which he admitted to all the allegations in the Statement of Reasons, except \nallegation 1.a. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 4, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me on June 9, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 19, \n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 22, 2009. During the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel offered two exhibits, which were marked as Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 and 2, and admitted without objection. Applicant testified and offered one exhibit, \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A, which also was admitted without objection. I held the record \nopen to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. Department Counsel \nforwarded without objection Applicant\u2019s timely submission of three additional exhibits, \nadmitted as AE B through D. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 27, 2009. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of facts relating \nto Jordan, set forth in six documents, marked as exhibits GE I through VI. Applicant \nrequested administrative notice of facts included in two documents, marked as AE I \nand II. Included in Applicant's post-hearing submission were two additional documents \nfor administrative notice, marked as AE III and IV. The facts administratively noticed \nare limited to matters of general knowledge and not subject to reasonable dispute. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 33 years old, was born in Jordan and immigrated to the United States \nin 1993, at the age of 17. He was not employed in Jordan before he left the country (Tr. \n30). He completed high school in the United States, and earned a double bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in information systems and operations management at a U.S. university (GE 1). \nApplicant has worked on federal contracts since 2004. He currently works in the \n \namended. \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 \nto the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR \nwas issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n3\n                                                \ninformation technology field for a defense contractor. He has held an interim clearance \nwithout incident (GE 1; Tr. 31-32). \n \n Applicant held a Jordanian passport from 2002 to November 2007 and did not \nrenew it when it expired.3 He applied for U.S. citizenship in March 2007 and was \nnaturalized in June 2008. He received his U.S. passport in July 2008. He does not \nbelieve that he is a dual U.S.-Jordanian citizen because he renounced foreign \ncitizenship when he took the U.S. citizenship oath.4 He has not traveled to Jordan since \nobtaining his U.S. passport. Applicant married in 2001. His wife, a citizen of Jordan, \nreceived her U.S. citizenship in April 2009. Their children, aged two and four, were born \nin the United States (GE 1, 2; Tr. 41, 69-70). \n \n \nApplicant's parents, four brothers, his brothers\u2019 families, and his in-laws are \ncitizens and residents of Jordan. He also has one brother who is a citizen and resident \nof the United States. Applicant first visited his family in Jordan in 2002, after being in \nthe United States for nine years. He visited his family again in 2006 and 2007. In April \n2008, he visited again when his father suffered a heart attack. Applicant has sent \nmoney to his family annually from approximately 2001 to the present (GE 1, 2; Tr. 30, \n46, 51, 71).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 69 years old and his father is 75. He is retired from a \nposition as a driver for a private electric company. Applicant keeps in touch with his \nparents weekly by telephone. He is in touch with two of his brothers approximately \nonce per year. One of these brothers formerly worked for a medical laboratory, but is \ncurrently unemployed. The other brother formerly worked for the Jordanian Housing \nAuthority, but currently works as a security guard in a private garage. Applicant speaks \nwith two other brothers more frequently, once every one to two months. One of these \nbrothers is an entrepreneur who operates a day-care center. The other manages a \nsupermarket. Applicant's family is aware that he is applying for a security clearance. \nApplicant has applied to the Department of Homeland Security to sponsor his family to \nbecome resident aliens in the United States (GE 1, 2; AE B, C, III, IV; Tr. 46-49, 53-55, \n67-68, 70-72).  \n \nApplicant's wife\u2019s parents and siblings are all Jordanian citizens and residents. \nHer family lived in the United States while one brother earned his master\u2019s degree. \nThey moved back to Jordan shortly after Applicant and his wife married in 2001. Her \nbrother returned to Jordan several years later. Her father is the chief financial officer of \na private hospital and her mother is a homemaker. Applicant's wife has one brother \nwho is an accountant and one who is a car salesman. Her two sisters are \nhomemakers. None of his in-laws work for the Jordanian government. Applicant\u2019s wife \nspeaks with her family about once per month, and Applicant speaks with his in-laws \n \n3 Applicant informed the investigator in his 2008 security interview that he had \u201csubmitted his foreign \npassport for cancellation\u201d in 2007. The report contains no further details about the cancellation (GE 2). \n \n4 Jordan considers U.S.-Jordanian dual nationals to be Jordanian citizens. (GE II at p. 3). \n\n \n \n4\nabout twice per year. Applicant\u2019s wife has applied to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to sponsor her family to become resident aliens in the United States (AE B, C, \nIII, IV; Tr. 55-61, 70-71). \n \nIn 2006, Applicant purchased approximately \u00bc acre of undeveloped land in \nJordan as an investment. He made a down payment of $40,000 on the $80,000 price. \nHe completed the purchase in 2007, after paying two installments of $20,000 each. \nLater, the downturn in the housing market made purchase of a home in the United \nStates more feasible. He put the land up for sale in 2008, hoping it would provide funds \nfor a down payment on a house in the United States. However, due to the recent \nfinancial crisis, the property remains unsold (GE 1, 2; AE D; Tr. 61-63). \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant opened a checking account in Jordan with a $299 \ndeposit, expecting to use it to help his parents, if necessary. He provided \ndocumentation showing that he closed the account in May 2009. He testified that he \nauthorized the bank to disburse the $299 in the account to his father (GE 2; AE A; Tr. \n63, 66-67). \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts derived from the submitted U.S. \ngovernment publications. Jordan is a Middle Eastern country with a constitutional \nmonarchy and a developing economy. It has a pro-western foreign policy and has had \nclose relations with the United States for six decades. On the other hand, Jordan has \nhad human rights issues, including prolonged detention, denial of due process, and \nsome restrictions of freedom of speech, press, assembly, and other human rights.  \n \nJordan cooperates with the United States in fighting international terrorism. \nHowever, the threat of terrorism carried out by transnational and local terrorist groups \nremains high. Terrorist groups use covert, overt, and clandestine activities to \nundermine and exploit U.S. national security interests. The Jordanian government \naggressively pursues terrorists. In recent years, terrorist plots against U.S. interests \nhave been interrupted by Jordanian security forces. The parliament has passed anti-\nmoney-laundering legislation aimed at individuals and entities that attempt to bankroll \nterrorist groups. It has also organized a state security court that specializes in cases \ninvolving terrorism. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \n\n \n \n5\n                                                \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).5 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of disqualifying or mitigating conditions does not \ndetermine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines are followed when a case can be so measured, as they represent policy \nguidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.  \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to receive or continue \nto have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance. Additionally, the government must be able to prove \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it falls to \napplicants to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has \na \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, applicants bear a heavy burden of persuasion.7 A \nperson who has access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship based on \ntrust and confidence. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that \napplicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to protect the \nnational interest as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d \nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for \naccess to classified information in favor of the government.8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern pertaining to foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the \nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or \nis vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \n \n5 Directive. 6.3. \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n7 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n \n6\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target \nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions are AG \u00b6 7(a), 7(b) and 7(e): \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information; \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, \nwhich could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAlthough foreign family ties are not automatically disqualifying, they do raise the \npotential of foreign influence. Applicant\u2019s parents, brothers and in-laws live in Jordan. \nHe has visited Jordan four times since 2002, and he stays with his family during these \nvisits. Applicant's wife also has family in Jordan. She keeps in touch with them, and \nApplicant sometimes speaks with them as well. Applicant's bank account is closed and \nno longer presents a security concern; however, his unsold \u00bc acre of land represents \nan ongoing property interest. AG \u00b6 7(a), 7(b) and 7(e) apply. \n \nThe foreign influence guideline also includes factors that can mitigate \ndisqualifying conditions. Under AG \u00b6 8, the following mitigating conditions are relevant:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual \n\n \n \n7\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation; \n \nAlthough Jordan has serious problems with terrorist activities, it works \naggressively to combat terrorism. Applicant's family and in-laws do not have high-\nprofile jobs or connections with the government. Jordan\u2019s relationship with the United \nStates goes back decades, and its track record of cooperation makes it unlikely that it \nwould exploit Applicant for information through his family. Mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n8(a) applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply in mitigation. Applicant maintains a relationship with \nhis family in Jordan. His weekly contacts with his parents, monthly contacts with two of \nhis brothers, his visits, and his monetary gifts all demonstrate his ties of affection and \nobligation to his family, which creates a potential risk of foreign influence. \n \n \nHowever, Applicant's ties to the United States weigh in his favor when \nevaluating the question of potential conflicts of interest. After coming to the United \nStates as a teenager, Applicant completed high school and earned his college degree \nhere. He registered for the Selective Service, though he was not a U.S. citizen, so that \nhe could assist the United States if he were needed. He married here and his children \nare native-born U.S. citizens. He is raising his family here, and hopes to buy a home in \nthe near future. He has been employed for approximately ten years, and has \ncontributed to federal projects since 2004. Applicant has spent half of his life in the \nUnited States, and has demonstrated that he intends to remain here. I conclude that he \nwould choose these strong U.S. ties over his foreign connections, in the event that a \nconflict of interest arose. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. I find for Applicant on Guideline B. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n \n8\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the cited \nguideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nForeign family ties raise security concerns because of the potential for conflicts \nof interest and foreign influence. Here, Applicant\u2019s ongoing relationship with family \nmembers in Jordan raises such concerns. He is in frequent contact with his parents, \nand he has traveled to Jordan four times since 2002. However, Applicant has lived half \nof his life in the United States. His education, marriage, children, and his employment \nrepresent deep ties to the United States. He has contributed to federal contracts since \n2004, and has held an interim security clearance with no evidence of security issues. \nGiven these facts, and Applicant's significant ties to the United States, I conclude that \nhe would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.   \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised concerning Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.g.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

Jeffrey, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I \nconclude that Applicant mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations.  His eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nApplicant signed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on August 26, 2008. On May 15, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn June 9, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing. He elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 9, \nDecember 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009. A Notice of Hearing, setting Applicant\u2019s hearing for October 21, 2009, was issued \nSeptember 17, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled to consider whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced four exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 4 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant testified \non his own behalf and called one witness. He introduced 22 exhibits, which were \nidentified and marked as Ex. A through Ex. V and admitted to the record without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on October 29, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains one allegation of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations. Applicant admitted the allegation and offered additional information. He \ndenied that the allegation raised security concerns under AG F. Applicant\u2019s admission is \nadmitted as a finding of fact. (SOR; Answer to SOR.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and employed as a computer programmer and \napplication developer by a government contractor. He has provided contract services to \na U.S. government agency for approximately 11 years. His gross annual salary is \napproximately $160,000. He attended college for about two years, but he has not \nearned a degree. He has held a security clearance since 1998. (Ex. 1; Tr. 41-44, 60-\n63.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents immigrated to the United States and became naturalized U.S. \ncitizens. Applicant and his two brothers and two sisters were born in the United States. \nApplicant is his parents\u2019 second oldest child and first-born son. Applicant\u2019s father works \nas a radio technician with a communications company. His mother, who has recently \nbecome disabled by blindness, worked as an administrative clerk in a physician\u2019s office. \n(Ex. 1; Tr. 65, 85-86.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant was in high school, he lived with his family in an eastern state. \nHis parents rented a home. They did not discuss their salaries or financial \ncircumstances with their children. In 1999, Applicant was no longer living at home and \nwas employed in another part of the United States. His parents contacted him and told \nhim they had an opportunity to purchase the home they had been renting. They asked \nApplicant, who was then about 21 years old and earning a good salary, to purchase the \nhome in his name and they would, in turn, pay the monthly mortgage on the property. \nApplicant agreed, and he alone signed the mortgage. He and his parents did not commit \nthis agreement to writing. All mortgage documents and payment books were sent to the \nparents at the home address. When the parents sought to refinance the property in \nAugust 2007, Applicant signed a document appointing his mother as his attorney-in-fact \nand authorizing her to exercise a specific power of attorney to refinance a loan secured \nby real property. (Ex. R; Tr. 45-48, 64-66, 79, 87-88.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant and his wife were married in June 2008. Soon thereafter, Applicant\u2019s \nwife became pregnant, and the couple began to think about purchasing a home. They \nchecked their credit reports to assess their financial strength. When he looked at his \ncredit report in July 2008, he was surprised to find several delinquent accounts: a VISA \ncredit card account, with a balance of $8,000, for which payment had not been made for \nthree months; a line of credit loan, with a balance of approximately $2,500, for which \npayment had not been made for two months; and an American Express credit card \naccount, with a balance of $5,000, which was in collection status.1 (Tr. 50-52.) \n \n \nThe delinquent debts identified on Applicant\u2019s credit report belonged to his \nparents. They had not told Applicant of their financial difficulties. Applicant identified the \nVisa account as one his father had opened in Applicant\u2019s name several years ago. \nApplicant used the card but maintained a zero balance. He thought the card had expired \nand the account was closed. However, he learned that the card had been activated and \nused, without his knowledge, by his parents, and they had accumulated a delinquency \nof $8,000 in his name.2 (Tr. 50-51, 88.) \n \n \nApplicant identified the line of credit as associated with the home mortgage that \nhe had signed in 1999. He concluded that his parents had incurred the line of credit \ndelinquency of $2,500. (Tr. 51-52.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was responsible for the American Express delinquency. \nApplicant was an additional cardholder on the account. When the account became \ndelinquent, the creditor sought payment from Applicant. (Tr. 52-53.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report also showed that his parents were past due on the \nmortgage payments for the house he had purchased for their use. In August 2008, \nApplicant reported on his e-QIP that the mortgage arrearage was $8,303. Applicant\u2019s \ncredit bureau report of September 2008 showed a delinquency of $11,070 on a \nmortgage account of $318,000. The SOR, relying on information found on Applicant\u2019s \nMarch 3, 2009, credit report, alleged that the total arrearage on the mortgage debt of \n$318,000 was $27,677 and that the mortgage had been placed in foreclosure. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a; Ex. 2; Tr. 54.) \n \n \nAfter learning of the delinquencies, Applicant sought an explanation from his \nparents. His parents were unable to explain why the delinquent debts had not been \npaid. Applicant contacted the credit card companies to close the accounts, and he \nrequested that all future statements be sent to him at his address and not to his parents. \nHe then sought a way to satisfy the debts. (Tr. 53.) \n \n \n1 The two credit card debts and the line of credit debt were not alleged on the SOR. \n \n2 The parents also used, without authorization, a credit card in the name of one of Applicant\u2019s younger \nbrothers. The brother discovered a delinquency of approximately $6,000 on the credit card at about the \nsame time in 2008 that Applicant discovered the delinquencies in his accounts that were attributable to \nhis parents. (Tr. 86-87.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant established a monthly payment plan to pay down the Visa debt. His \npersonal financial statement of September 30, 2009, shows a balance of $4,900 on the \naccount, with scheduled monthly payment of $166 and an actual payment of $400. \nApplicant paid the American Express delinquency of $5,000 in full, and the account was \nclosed by the creditor (Ex. U; Tr. 53-54.) \n \n \nApplicant asked his father to help to retire the line of credit debt. The father said \nhe would pay $100 a month on the debt. Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement of \nSeptember 30, 2009, shows that Applicant is also paying $100 a month on the debt. \n(Ex. U; Tr. 54.) \n \n \nApplicant contacted the company holding his mortgage and learned that his \nparents had requested and received a loan modification but had failed to make the \nrequired payments. The lender requested full payment of the loan from Applicant. (Tr. \n55.) \n \n \nApplicant did not have enough money to pay the full amount of the delinquency. \nThe mortgage holder would not accept any monthly mortgage payments until the \narrearage was satisfied. Applicant considered paying the arrearage, but he was not able \nto meet the monthly mortgage payments that would be required thereafter, and he could \nnot trust his parents to make them once the arrearage was satisfied.  (Tr. 79-81.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife struggled to find a way to resolve the situation. At one \npoint, they concluded that the only realistic option was foreclosure. In a letter, he stated: \n \nI realize a foreclosure is a drastic step, but in a situation like this my wife \nand I feel it is the only choice that makes sense since we have our own \nfamily to support and cannot afford to support my parents. This would also \ncut me [off from] all financial ties with my parents and I will be able to \nslowly build up my credit once again. \n \n (Ex. E) \n \n   \nAlthough no payments have been made on the mortgage loan since \napproximately March 2008, and the property is in pre-foreclosure status, Applicant\u2019s \nparents have remained in the home. Applicant and his wife consulted with a real estate \nattorney, who advised them to attempt a short sale of the property. In order for Applicant \nto list the property in a short sale, it would be necessary for Applicant\u2019s parents to \nvacate the premises. The parents have refused to leave the house, after repeated \ndemands by Applicant and his wife that they vacate. Applicant and his wife have hired \nan attorney who specializes in eviction actions to represent them. On September 24, \n2009, their attorney sent Applicant\u2019s parents a certified letter demanding that they \nvacate the property and advising them of legal action should they not comply. If his \nparents do not voluntarily comply with Applicant\u2019s request to vacate the property, he will \nauthorize eviction proceedings. (Ex. 3; Tr. 48, 55-57, 83-84.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified on his behalf. She is employed by a federal defense \nagency, and she was granted a security clearance by her agency in December 2008. \nDuring the investigation of her security worthiness by her agency, Applicant\u2019s wife \nprovided detailed information about her husband\u2019s delinquent mortgage and the actions \nof his parents. (Tr. 82, 99-102.)  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife provided a financial statement dated September 30, 2009. \nTheir total combined net monthly income is $13,400. They reported fixed monthly \nexpenses of $4,050. Their combined monthly debt payments are $7,158. They have a \nnet monthly remainder of $2,192. (Ex. U.) \n \n \nApplicant also reported $11,000 in savings and approximately $50,000 in his \n401(k) plan. He stated that he intended to use these resources to satisfy any deficiency \nthat might arise from foreclosure or a short sale of the property. (Tr. 58.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisors and co-workers provided letters that praised his technical \nskills in computer programming. Supervisors called his work performance \u201coutstanding.\u201d \nA co-worker who has worked with him for ten years stated: \u201c[Applicant] became highly \nrespected in our organization and was sought after for his knowledge, skills, and \nabilities in information systems.\u201d He has received several certificates of appreciation for \ninnovative computer applications. (Ex. G; Ex. H; Ex. I; Ex. J; Ex. K; Ex. L; Ex. M; Ex. N; \nEx. O; Ex. P; Ex. Q.) \n  \n  \n \n \n                                                 Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \n\n \n6 \n \n \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n7 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant, as a young man, acceded to his parents\u2019 request that he \ntake out a mortgage in his name on a property that they resided in. They promised to \nmake the monthly mortgage payments on the property, but they failed to do so and did \nnot advise Applicant of their inability to pay. As a newlywed, Applicant learned that his \nparents had not only failed to pay the mortgage, but they had used credit cards and \nmade additional unauthorized charges in his name. Because of his parents\u2019 actions, \nApplicant was legally responsible for a financial delinquency of at least $27,677. This \nevidence is sufficient to raise these two potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant admitted a financial delinquency related to a mortgage loan on a \nproperty he purchased for his parents in 1999. Although there was no written \nagreement, the parents agreed to make all of the mortgage payments. All mortgage \ncorrespondence was sent to the parents. Applicant lived in another part of the country \nfrom his parents, and he was not aware of their financial situation or their failure to pay \nthe mortgage. Applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 actions were beyond his control. \n \nOnce he learned that his parents had incurred delinquencies in his name, \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. He contacted the credit card \ncreditors and made arrangements to pay them. He set up a payment plan to satisfy the \nline of credit debt. When his father agreed to pay $100 a month on the delinquency, \nApplicant, knowing his father\u2019s payment history, also paid the creditor $100 each month. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe mortgage delinquency presented significant financial and familial difficulties. \nApplicant lacked the resources to pay the mortgage debt of $318,000 in full. While he \ncould have satisfied the arrearage, he did not have the resources to continue to pay his \nparents\u2019 monthly mortgage debt, and he could not trust them to pay it in the future. \nWhen he asked them to vacate the property so that he could list the home for a short \nsale, they refused to cooperate. Despite these difficulties, Applicant and his wife have \nmoved forward, sought legal counsel, and have taken action to resolve the debt \nresponsibly. \n \nApplicant was caught in a severe downturn in the real estate market and, \nunfortunately, he was misused by his own parents, whose refusal to meet their financial \nobligations reflected poorly and unfairly on Applicant. This is an unusual circumstance, \nunlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant has learned, through experience, some hard financial lessons. He has \nalso acknowledged his financial responsibilities and has made good-faith efforts to \nsatisfy his creditors. His own financial record reflects reasonable risk-taking and \nresponsible financial behavior. He continues to try to resolve a financial obligation he \ndid not seek. He has identified savings and money in his 401(k) plan that he will use, if \nnecessary, to satisfy a deficiency arising from a foreclosure or a short sale of the \nproperty. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) apply in mitigation \nto the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 31 years old and a \n\n \n9 \n \n \nhighly skilled computer programmer. He has worked as a contract employee serving the \nsame federal agency for 11 years. His supervisors and co-workers value his skills and \nabilities; they consider his work to be outstanding. Applicant has held a security \nclearance, without incident, since 1998. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife also holds a security clearance and is employed by a federal \nagency. She, like Applicant, realizes the importance of financial responsibility, and she \nhas fully disclosed Applicant\u2019s financial situation to security personnel in her agency. \nApplicant and his wife have every reason to be prudent, reliable, and resourceful in their \npersonal and professional lives. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began when his parents \nfailed to honor a commitment they made to him. Applicant and his wife responded to \nthis setback with energy and determination. I observed Applicant carefully at his \nhearing; I assessed his credibility; and I carefully reviewed the record evidence in this \ncase. I have no doubt that he will honor any legal financial obligations that arise from \nsigning the mortgage on his parents\u2019 home. I believe it is highly unlikely that in the future \nhe will fail to carry out any of the responsibilities of a person entrusted with a security \nclearance and the protection of classified information. I conclude that he is not a \nsecurity risk. \n \nApplicant is a serious and responsible person. He has shown good faith in \ncontacting his creditors and working with them to resolve or alleviate his indebtedness. \nHe is currently living within his means and paying attention to his financial obligations.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and eligibility and suitability for a security clearance, and I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n                    FOR  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:                                For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it  is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                          \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The Judge\u2019s application of Mitigating Condition 20(e) is not sustainable\nbecause there is no documentation to support its application to the pertinent medical debts, and\nApplicant was unable to explain reasonably why she had not taken the normal course of claims\nsubmissions for those debts.  20(e) does not apply to the one cited non-medical debt because the\ndocument submitted was not sufficient to demonstrate that the debt was not legitimately her\nresponsibility.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n2\nBrian D. Aston, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 14, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 16, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Department Counsel appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: (a)  whether the Judge made\nerroneous material factual findings; (b) whether the Judge erred in applying certain Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Conditions; and (c)  whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is\nunsustainable because it fails to address critical aspects of the case.  For the following reasons, the\nBoard reverses the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance determination.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:\nApplicant is 39 years old and recently worked as a truck driver for a DoD contractor before\nher interim DoD security clearance was withdrawn.  She is currently not working.  In 1991,\nApplicant\u2019s house burned.  As a result, she received assistance for low-income housing under\nSection 8 (See United States Housing Act) and rented property from 1991 until 1998.  At the time\nshe vacated the property she believed all her rents had been paid and all required repairs were\ncompleted and paid.  Applicant\u2019s former husband owes her $17,000 in unpaid child support.\nApplicant married her current husband in 1995.  While they had no children together,\nApplicant\u2019s husband has helped raise Applicant\u2019s three children from prior marriages.  Applicant\ndecided to stop working in 1998 and to stay at home owing to medical problems with her children.\nShe did work at selling items at flea markets between 1998 and 2002.  Her husband worked two jobs\nas a trucker for a time, and then accepted a full time job in 1998.  In 2000, Applicant\u2019s husband\ninjured his back on the job, and as a result he was laid up for three months.  During this time, he did\nnot receive any salary or worker\u2019s compensation payments because of a dispute regarding who was\nliable for the payments.  With no income for three months, Applicant and her husband did not pay\ntheir bills.  Applicant\u2019s husband returned to work against his doctor\u2019s advice after three months.  The\ncouple filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in February 2001.  They made approximately $12,000 in\n\n3\npayments during the bankruptcy.  In 2002, Applicant\u2019s husband purchased a two-bedroom trailer for\n$2,300, which became the family\u2019s home.  In September 2002, Applicant\u2019s husband collapsed\nbecause of problems related to his earlier back injury and he could no longer work. \nApplicant\u2019s husband did not receive worker\u2019s compensation for a significant period of time\nfollowing the recurrence of his injury.  As a result, Applicant and her husband could not make any\nadditional payments under their bankruptcy plan and got behind on their bills.  The bankruptcy court\ndismissed their case in March 2003.  After the dismissal of the bankruptcy petition, Applicant\u2019s\nhusband began receiving 80% of his salary as his worker\u2019s compensation benefit.  Applicant and her\nhusband received a $15,000 settlement from a car insurance carrier in 2003.  They used the\nsettlement money to fund a four-month truck driving school for Applicant and used the $6,000\nremainder to pay some of their accumulated bills.  Applicant began a career as a truck driver in\nDecember 2003.\nIn 2004, Applicant\u2019s husband received $21,000 in settlement of his initial worker\u2019s\ncompensation claim.  He purchased a larger trailer for the family home in the amount of $18,000 and\nused the balance to pay some medical bills.  In May 2005, Applicant\u2019s employer provided her with\na truck that contained mold.  A prior asthmatic condition triggered a severe allergic reaction to the\nmold.  She missed work for four months, during which time Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s back injury\ncontinued to prevent him from working.  Applicant incurred medical bills for her condition, which\nshe submitted for worker\u2019s compensation payment.  Her worker\u2019s compensation case remains\nunresolved, as do the underlying medical bills.  \nIn August 2006, Applicant\u2019s husband settled his second worker\u2019s compensation case for\n$310,000.  He and Applicant purchased a house and land in a rural area for $ 155,000 cash, a car for\n$22,000, a $16,000 pool to help with the husband\u2019s back injury and a special bed for $6,000.  They\npurchased house furnishings, paid $7,800 for Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s funeral and placed $50,000 in\na retirement annuity.  After these purchases, $43,000 remained.  Applicant did not explain why the\nmoney was not used to pay the medical bills not covered by worker\u2019s compensation and incurred\nthrough December 2006.  However, the tax return discussion infra may explain her financial\ndecisions.\nAfter moving into their new house in 2006, Applicant and her husband rented their trailer\nunder a rent-to-own contract.  The prospective purchasers violated the contract by not paying\nproperty taxes on the trailer and moved out.  Applicant recently learned that she is responsible for\nunpaid taxes for the years 2007 and 2008 in the amount of $2,128.  She paid $720 in August 2009\nand has agreed to pay $194 a month for the next 11 months.       \nIn December 2006, Applicant\u2019s teenage sons were badly injured in a car accident.  She\nincurred medical bills for their treatment.  A civil lawsuit is currently pending and the parties are\ndiscussing a possible settlement.\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s husband was released to return to work in January 2008.  Applicant decided to\njoin him to form a husband and wife truck driving team.  The job proved too stressful and they\ndecided to end it.  They then decided to purchase their own truck.  The vehicle cost $130,000.  They\npaid $57,000 down and anticipate repaying the balance in two and one-half years.  The monthly\nincome from owning and operating the truck is projected to be $997 per month.  The $194 monthly\ntax debt is not included in this calculation.  The retirement annuity has been cashed to pay bills, as\nApplicant and her husband cannot work until the clearance issue is resolved.  \nApplicant\u2019s 2007 and 2008 income tax returns, filed jointly with her husband, reflect that\nthey paid medical bills in the amounts of $16,560 and $13,567 respectively during those years.  \nThe SOR alleges $26,061 in unpaid debts, $13,000 of which is from a power company.\nApplicant denies owing this debt.  At the hearing, Applicant provided a letter from the power\ncompany, which indicated she did not owe any money to it.  Subsequent to the hearing, Applicant\nand her counsel contacted the collection agency listed as the holder of the debt.  The collection\nagency has not provided specific information on the debt.  Applicant has challenged the debt, in an\neffort to determine, what, if any, amount she owes.  The majority of the remaining debts, $12,350\nworth, concern medical bills for Applicant and her family and are held by one collection agency.\n$8,998 of the debts are bills attributed to Applicant, $176 to her husband, and $1,663 to her sons.\nThe son\u2019s bills are for medical services provided between August 2004 and January 2006 and are\nnot related to their accident injuries. $3,296 of Applicant\u2019s bills, incurred between May 2005 and\nDecember 2005 are connected to her work-related asthma problems.\nIn the past, Applicant paid some money to the collection agency holding the majority of the\nmedical debts listed in the SOR.  In March 2009, she started a payment plan with this agency.  She\nagreed to pay $25 a month and make the payment through September 2009.  After that the creditor\nwill charge her bank account each month for the monthly payment.  She could not pay the creditor\u2019s\nrecent one-time settlement offer. \nA friend of the Applicant, who works as an auctioneer, recommended Applicant for a\nclearance as she is trustworthy.  Applicant\u2019s employer and co-workers describe her as reliable,\nefficient, hard working, honest, and dependable.\nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\nDecision at 5.\n1\nThe Judge erroneously found that the remainder was $43,000.  On appeal, both parties cite the figure of\n2\n$53,000, and that figure is supported by the record evidence.\nTr. 138-142.\n3\n5\nDepartment Counsel asserts four specific errors concerning the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.\nThese involve record evidence which the Judge either omitted from her findings or from which she\nmade unsupported findings.   \nDepartment Counsel first argues that the Judge erroneously found that Applicant had used\nthe remainder from the $310,000 settlement to pay other medical bills not alleged in the SOR, and\ntherefore Applicant did not have a pool of money with which to pay her remaining debts.\nDepartment Counsel bases this assertion on the Judge\u2019s mentioning of the 2007 and 2008 tax returns\nin the next sentence, the mentioning creating an inference that the settlement remainder was used\nto pay off medical debts that later showed up as deductions on the tax returns.\nDepartment Counsel is correct in arguing that, given the lack of evidence on this point, the\nJudge\u2019s inference was speculative and improper\u2013 if, in fact, making such an inference is what she\ndid.  The Judge\u2019s language is cryptic and it is difficult for the Board to determine what she meant\nby the statement, \u201cApplicant did not explain why this money was not used to pay those medical bills\nnot covered by worker\u2019s compensation and incurred through December 2006.  However, the tax\nreturn discussion infra may explain her financial decisions.\u201d   That discussion, occurring later in the\n1\nJudge\u2019s findings of fact,  merely mentions the dollar amounts of medical bill deductions on the tax\nreturns and establishes no link between those deductions and any settlement remainder money.  The\nrecord evidence does not establish such a link.  Thus, to the extent the Judge made a finding, by\ninference, that the $310,000 settlement remainder money was used to pay medical bills listed on the\ntax returns, such a finding was erroneous.   The record strongly indicates the contrary.  When cross-\n2\nexamined by Department Counsel at the hearing, Applicant was asked at some length to indicate how\nthe $310,000 settlement had been spent.  Although given ample opportunity to do so,  Applicant did\nnot respond at any time that a portion of the settlement money had been used to retire any debts, let\nalone the medical debt tabulated on the tax returns.   Indeed, the Judge\u2019s explicit finding that\n3\nApplicant did not explain why this money was not used to pay medical bills not covered by worker\u2019s\ncompensation seriously undercuts any suggestion or inference that the settlement remainder was used\nfor that purpose.\nSecondly, Department Counsel argues that the Judge committed error by failing to make any\nfactual findings concerning Applicant\u2019s hesitation about paying her delinquent medical bills unless\nthe creditors reduced the amounts owed.  Department Counsel states that the Judge\u2019s failure to\naddress this aspect of the case directly affected her Guideline F analysis, in particular her conclusion\nthat Applicant made a good-faith effort to responsibly address her indebtedness.  Department\nCounsel\u2019s argument has merit.\n\nDepartment Counsel notes that there is ample precedent for the proposition that it is error for a Judge to fail\n4\nto consider contrary record evidence or an important aspect of the case.  In addition to many cases where the issue is\nmentioned in a paragraph setting forth the framework for the Board\u2019s analysis, the Board has previously addressed this\nerror in several cases that ought to be familiar to the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-16511 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Dec.\n4, 2009); ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009); ISCR Case No. 08-05869 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 24,\n2009): ISCR Case No. 07-15281 at 4 and 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 16, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-13890 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 27,\n2009); ISCR Case No. 07-16841 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No,. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29,\n2008); and ISCR Case No. 07-00558 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Apr. 7, 2008).  As the Board noted in ISCR Case No. 08-01122\nat n. 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009), \u201cNo benefit accrues from persistent disregard of agency policy and a superior tribunal.\u201d\nThe debts alleged at subparagraphs 1.n.,1.s.,1.t.,1.aa.,1.bb., and 1.rr. of the SOR.\n5\n6\nA Judge is not required to discuss each and every piece of record evidence in making a\ndecision, but the Judge cannot ignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record evidence that\na reasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.\nISCR Case No. 05-03250 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-19479 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 22,\n2004).  Department Counsel correctly argues that Applicant\u2019s attempts to settle outstanding debts\nat a reduced amount speaks directly to an evaluation of the good faith nature of Applicant\u2019s effort\nto reduce indebtedness responsibly, given the record evidence of the fact that she had funds available\nto fully satisfy these debts, and the fact that Applicant\u2019s attempts to settle the debts for a lesser\namount resulted in their going unpaid.  Thus, Applicant\u2019s attempts to settle the debts in the manner\nshe did was an important aspect of the case affecting an evaluation of mitigation that warranted\nrecognition and analysis on the part of the Judge.4\nThirdly, Department Counsel claims error on the part of the Judge because of her finding that\nsix debts alleged in the SOR  resulted from Applicant\u2019s own work-related illness (asthma) and,\n5\ntherefore, should have been paid for by a third party, either worker\u2019s compensation or her insurance\nprovider.  This contention has mixed merit.  In her findings of fact the Judge clearly states that she\nconsidered the six bills, in an aggregate amount of $3,296, to be connected to her work-related\nasthma problems.  Contrary to Department Counsel\u2019s assertions, the dates of services for these\nmedical debts are not inconsistent with the time frame of injury claimed by Applicant.  She went to\nwork for a trucking company in April 2004 and drove for them until May 2005, at which time she\nwas required to drive in a truck cab containing mold.  She became seriously ill, ceased working for\nthe company, and was hospitalized for her condition.  The record establishes that she continued to\nexperience problems for approximately three months and was seeing a doctor for her condition.  As\nDepartment Counsel points out, the dates of the medical services provided on these bills include May\n2005, September 2005, and December 2005.   This sequence is proximately related to the work-\nrelated health issues described by Applicant, and therefore the Judge could reasonably conclude that\nthe bills in question were from work-related injuries.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s assignment of error on this point continues with the  assertion that the\nJudge found that, because the injuries were work related, the medical bills should have been paid by\neither worker\u2019s compensation or insurance and Applicant\u2019s denial of the debts is legitimate.\nDepartment Counsel states that the Judge\u2019s finding is not supported by such relevant evidence as a\n\nTr. at 145-147.\n6\nTr. at 87-88.\n7\n\u201c[T]he individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of\n8\nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to\nresolve the issue.\u201d\nSOR allegation 1.hh.\n9\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit C.\n10\n7\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate.  On this record, Department Counsel\u2019s assertion has\nmerit.\nThere is testimony from the Applicant to the effect that she submitted medical bills related\nto her 2005 work-related medical issues to either worker\u2019s compensation or her employer\u2019s health\ninsurer.  However, Applicant provided no documentation to show that she was covered by her\nemployer\u2019s health insurance at the time of her health issues, or that she had filed the appropriate\nclaims with either her employer\u2019s health insurance or worker\u2019s compensation.  She testified that she\nnever filed specific claims with the employer\u2019s insurance company, but had tried to contact them\ntelephonically.  Applicant also testified that she sent a letter to the insurance company, but that she\nwas unable to produce it as she had not retained a copy.   When asked by her attorney at the hearing\n6\nif it were determined by the employer\u2019s insurance company that she, rather than they, were\nresponsible for the outstanding medical bills, Applicant indicated that she would be willing to accept\nthat responsibility.   \n7\nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the\nsubstantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations under \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent\nallegations.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).  At that point, the\nburden shifts to Applicant to establish either that she is not responsible for the debt or that matters\nin mitigation apply.  Given the state of the record evidence concerning the bills related to Applicant\u2019s\n2005 work-related illness, there is insufficient evidence to support the Judge\u2019s finding that\nApplicant\u2019s denial of these debts is legitimate and that the debts should be paid by the insurance\ncompany.  As the evidence cited in the previous paragraph indicates, Applicant\u2019s own testimony\nindicates that she remains open to the possibility that the debts may ultimately be her responsibility.\nThus, as Department Counsel argues, the fact that the Judge\u2019s finding on this point is unsustainable\nsignificantly undercuts her application of Guideline F Mitigating Condition 20(e)   \n8\nLastly, Department Counsel argues that the Judge committed factual errors with respect to\na $13,000 debt from a power company.   The Judge found that, at the hearing, Applicant provided\n9\na letter from the power company which indicated she did not owe any money to it.   Department\n10\nCounsel states that, in fact, the letter from the power company addressing the debt was inconclusive\nin that an attorney for the power company only told Applicant that he could not determine the nature\nof the product or service underlying the debt.  Department Counsel also asserts that the letter was\n\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit M.\n11\nIn her discussion of the applicability of Mitigating Condition 20(e), the Judge seems to base her conclusion\n12\nthat Applicant rightfully challenged the validity of the power company debt on her finding that the power company stated\nApplicant did not owe it any money.\n\u2018[I]nability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d\n13\n\u2018[A] history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n14\n\u201c[T]he behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n15\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\n8\nnot a definitive determination that Applicant did not have an ongoing financial obligation, because\nthe Applicant\u2019s credit report  reflects that the debt has been assigned to a collection agency, and there\nis no evidence that Applicant is not indebted to this collection agency as a successor to the power\ncompany.  Finally, Department Counsel notes that Applicant admitted in a post-hearing affidavit that\nthe collection agency still held her liable for the debt and that if it is determined that she still owes\non the debt, she will develop a repayment plan.11\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s characterization of the letter from the power company is correct.  The\nletter states that after a search of the records related to Applicant and a specific address, the company\nwas unable to identify the source of the debt.  This stands in contrast to the Judge\u2019s finding that the\npower company confirmed that Applicant does not owe it any money.  There is also the matter of\nthe assignment of the debt to another entity.  The Judge\u2019s finding is not supported by the record\nevidence, and to the extent that the Judge\u2019s application of Mitigating Condition 20(e) relies on it,\nthat application is also in error.12\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA. Conclusions\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions:\nThe record evidence is sufficient to raise Guideline F Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) and\n13\n19(c).   Mitigating Condition 20(a)  does not apply.  Applicant\u2019s financial problems began when\n14\n15\nher husband injured his back at work in 2000, did not work for three months, and did not receive\nworker\u2019s compensation benefits.  Her husband reinjured his back in 2002, causing him to stop\nworking for more than five years.  For sometime after this injury, he did not receive any worker\u2019s\ncompensation benefits.  In 2005, Applicant missed four months of work because of a job-related\ninjury.  These injuries and the resulting loss of income were beyond her control.  Most of the\naccumulated debts from this period of time are paid, except some of the medical bills.  Applicant\nacted reasonably under the circumstances by paying the bills as she could and obtaining a new job\n\n\u201c[T]he conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\n16\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted reasonably under the circumstances.\u201d\n\u201c[T]he person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\n17\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\n\u2018[T]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n18\n9\nskill to help earn income.  Thus, Mitigating Condition 20(b)  applies.  Mitigating Condition 20(c)\n16\n17\ndoes not apply.  \nApplicant paid several smaller bills listed in the SOR.  She has developed a payment plan\nand has worked diligently, and continues to work, to resolve all unpaid bills.  She has made major\nprogress in her debt resolution and her finances are sound.  Mitigating Condition 20(d)  partially\n18\napplies.  Mitigating Condition 20(e) applies to the power company debt and the more than $3,000\nof the medical debt listed in connection with Applicant\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation case. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to Applicant under the whole person\nconcept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial.  Applicant\u2019s husband received a\nlarge settlement for his second work-related back injury.  They used this money wisely and not\nfoolishly.  Over the last few years, Applicant and her husband strived to attain family stability and\nfinancial security after years of poverty-level living and financial instability.  Between 2006 and\n2008, they paid $30,000 in medical bills.  They made financial choices that they believed best served\ntheir family.  Applicant and her husband think about how to spend their money and do so wisely.\nShe is resolving the outstanding medical bills slowly.  While some debts remain unpaid, they are\ninsufficient to raise security concerns.\nB. Discussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). \n\u201c[N]o one has a right to a security clearance. . . The general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal Board may reverse a Judge\u2019s decision to grant,\ndeny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.3.\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge erred by applying Mitigating Condition 20(b)\nto the benefit of Applicant.  Department Counsel maintains that even if Applicant\u2019s indebtedness\nwas the result of a situation that was beyond her control, applicability of Mitigating Condition 20(b)\n\nDecision at 5.\n19\n10\nis predicated upon Applicant having acted reasonably under the circumstances.  Department Counsel\nargues that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant acted reasonably runs counter to the record\nevidence.  This argument has merit.\nDepartment Counsel points to the Judge\u2019s conclusion that despite having received over\n$345,000 in insurance and settlement payments, Applicant acted reasonably, even though many\nlongstanding medical bills remain unpaid.  Department Counsel correctly states that the Judge failed\nto consider the fact that Applicant did not repay her delinquent debts when she had the financial\nmeans to do so, and the efforts that she did take to address many of her debts did not take place until\nor shortly before her receipt of the SOR.  Department Counsel also asserts that the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that Applicant acted reasonably is based upon an erroneous determination that Applicant\nhad addressed the majority of her outstanding debts, \u201cexcept some of the medical bills.\u201d  The record\nevidence shows that 42 out of 47 debts alleged in the SOR are medical bills and only one has been\npaid.  Also, of the five remaining non-medical debts, there is only substantial evidence of two having\nbeen paid.  Department Counsel also correctly points out that a significant portion of the settlement\nmoney is not accounted for, and the Judge, when making her findings, had no solid explanation for\nwhy a $43,000 remainder from the $310,000 settlement was not used to retire debts.   The burden\n19\nwas on Applicant to show that the settlement remainder money was either unavailable for debt\nrepayment or was, in fact, used to retire debt.  The evidence does not establish circumstances that\nsupport the conclusion that these monies were used reasonably, given the amount of outstanding\ndebt.  The Judge\u2019s application of Mitigating Condition 20(b) is not supported by the record.\nDepartment Counsel notes that the Judge indicated that Mitigating Condition 20(d) partially\napplied, but she did not state which debts it applied to.  Department Counsel referenced the Judge\u2019s\nconclusions where she stated that since her husband\u2019s injuries in 2000 and 2002, Applicant has\nworked diligently, and continues to work, to resolve all unpaid bills, has made major progress in her\ndebt resolution, and her finances are sound.  Department Counsel persuasively argues that this\nanalysis is unsupported by the record evidence. \nApplicant provided documentation at the hearing that three debts had been paid shortly\nbefore the hearing.  Documentation purporting to establish payment of two more debts is unclear.\nThe record includes Applicant\u2019s testimony that only a few sporadic payments were made between\n2004 and 2006 on undisputed medical debts that totaled more than $7,000.  These payments were\nmade in increments of $25 and Applicant testified that she made fewer than 20 payments on the\ndebts and then stopped making payments, claiming she could no longer do so because she was\nearning less pay.  For two years Applicant talked with the creditor, attempting to get them to settle\nthe debts for a reduced amount.  In March 2009, Applicant, according to her testimony, started up\n$25 dollar payments again.  The only documentary evidence of debt repayment is of a $100 payment\nmade the day before the hearing.\n\nAlso relevant to an evaluation of the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s finances \u201care sound\u201d are the existence\n20\nof the $13,000 power company debt, and the $3,000 worth of medical debt that Applicant believes should be covered\nby worker\u2019s compensation.  There is no substantial evidence that these debts are not Applicant\u2019s responsibility.  They\nhave yet to be resolved.  The power company debt alone represents approximately half of the total amount of outstanding\ndelinquent debt alleged in the SOR.\n11\nThe evidence indicates that Applicant\u2019s efforts at debt repayment have been sporadic, done\nlittle to reduce the overall amount of remaining debt, and have been largely influenced by her\nattempts to get the creditor to settle for lesser amounts, despite having the means at hand to retire\nthe debt.  In the absence of a meaningful track record of repayments, it cannot reasonably be\nsuggested here that Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to repay her creditors or otherwise\nresolve her debts, as is required for application of Mitigating Condition 20(d).  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 01-21386 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun 11,\n2003).  Moreover, many of Applicant\u2019s efforts at debt settlement have been very recent, despite the\nfact that the debts are a number of years old, and Applicant and her husband received the $310,000\nworker\u2019s compensation settlement in August 2006.  Department Counsel correctly points out that\nthe Judge did not discuss the timing of Applicant\u2019s repayment efforts in her mitigation analysis.  The\ntiming of Applicant\u2019s actions impacts on the degree to which Mitigating Condition 20(d) applies.\nThe failure of the Judge to analyze the timing of Applicant\u2019s actions was error.  See., e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009).  The timing of Applicant\u2019s actions further undercuts\nthe applicability of Mitigating Condition 20(d).  There is insufficient evidence in the record to\nsupport the applicability of Mitigating Condition 20(d).        \n20\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s application of Mitigating Condition 20(e)\nconstitutes harmful error because the conclusions made thereunder are unsupported by the record\nevidence or rely on erroneous findings.  This decision has already discussed errors with regard to the\nJudge\u2019s findings of fact regarding the $13,000 power company debt and the six medical debts arising\nin 2005 which Applicant claimed were work related.  Department Counsel asserts that to establish\napplicability of Mitigating Condition 20(e), Applicant must show more than she simply disagrees\nwith the debt, doesn\u2019t recognize the debt, or feels that another party should pay the debt.  This\nassertion has merit.  The mitigating condition speaks in terms of having a reasonable basis to dispute\nthe legitimacy of the past due debt and providing documented proof to substantiate the basis of the\ndispute.\nIn the case of the six medical debts, Applicant provided no documentation whatsoever that\nwould establish that the insurer is ultimately responsible for the debts.  Also, Applicant offered only\nvague testimony about submitting bills to the insurer and making telephone calls to an insurance\nrepresentative when describing her efforts to resolve the issue.  She was unable to adequately explain\nwhy she had not taken the normal course of making claims submissions to either the insurance\ncompany or worker\u2019s compensation, and was unable to produce a letter she had written to the\ninsurance company.  This evidence is insufficient to establish reasonable and meaningful efforts to\nresolve the medical bills.\n\n The inclusion of the power company debt on two of Applicant\u2019s credit reports was enough to establish the\n21\ngovernment\u2019s prima facie case regarding the indebtedness.\nIn addition to the new home, which presumably is owned jointly with her husband, expenditures that benefitted\n22\nApplicant directly included a $22,000 cash payment for her car and $7,800 for her mother\u2019s funeral expenses.  The\nevidence also indicates that two lawn tractors were purchased at least partly at Applicant\u2019s direction (Tr. p. 40).\n12\nRegarding the $13,000 power company debt, Applicant did provide a letter from the power\ncompany that raised the possibility that the debt might not be hers, but the letter stops short of\nproviding substantial evidence that the debt was illegitimate.  While testifying, Applicant was unable\nto offer any insight as to the basis of her denial of this debt, other than the fact that she did not\nrecognize it.   There is evidence that Applicant made some effort to resolve this debt, but, in terms\n21\nof mitigation, these efforts are undercut by the fact that they occurred very late in the game\u2013 either\ndays before the hearing or immediately thereafter, and are insufficient by themselves to provide a\nbasis for the application of the mitigating condition.  The totality of the record evidence regarding\nthese debts does not support application of Mitigating Condition 20(e).   \nDepartment Counsel states that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is merely a recitation of\nfavorable facts that are otherwise mentioned within her Guideline F analysis.  After review, the\nBoard concludes that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is largely repetitive of her Guideline F\nanalysis, with the exception of a recognition that Applicant and her husband occupied a position of\ntrust when transporting currency for the government and never violated that position, and that a\nwitness trusted Applicant with the care of her mother.  The Board concludes that these additional\nfactors do not support an ultimate ruling in Applicant\u2019s favor under Guideline F, given all the\ncontrary evidence in the record.       \nApplicant asserts that Department Counsel incorrectly presumes that the manner in which\nthe $310,000 settlement was utilized was a matter within Applicant\u2019s control.  While Applicant\u2019s\nhusband received the settlement, the record evidence reveals that the monies were spent to benefit\nboth the husband and Applicant.   Also, the record contains no evidence that Applicant\u2019s husband\n22\nprevented Applicant from using settlement proceeds to retire longstanding debts.  The burden was\non Applicant to establish that the $310,000 settlement monies were unavailable to her for the\npurpose of retiring debt.  She failed to meet that burden.  Applicant\u2019s argument is not persuasive. \n \nThe record as a whole does not support a conclusion that Applicant has met her burden of\npersuasion in light of the Egan standard.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision is not sustainable.\n \n\n13\nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a security clearance is\nREVERSED.\n     \nSigned: Michael Y.

    "discussion": "infra may explain her financial decisions. After moving into their new house in 2006, Applicant and her husband rented their trailer under a rent-to-own contract. The prospective purchasers violated the contract by not paying property taxes on the trailer and moved out. Applicant recently learned that she is responsible for unpaid taxes for the years 2007 and 2008 in the amount of $2,128. She paid $720 in August 2009 and has agreed to pay $194 a month for the next 11 months. In December 2006, Applicant\u2019s teenage sons were badly injured in a car accident. She incurred medical bills for their treatment. A civil lawsuit is currently pending and the parties are discussing a possible settlement. 4 Applicant\u2019s husband was released to return to work in January 2008. Applicant decided to join him to form a husband and wife truck driving team. The job proved too stressful and they decided to end it. They then decided to purchase their own truck. The vehicle cost $130,000. They paid $57,000 down and anticipate repaying the balance in two and one-half years. The monthly income from owning and operating the truck is projected to be $997 per month. The $194 monthly tax debt is not included in this calculation. The retirement annuity has been cashed to pay bills, as Applicant and her husband cannot work until the clearance issue is resolved. Applicant\u2019s 2007 and 2008 income tax returns, filed jointly with her husband, reflect that they paid medical bills in the amounts of $16,560 and $13,567 respectively during those years. The SOR alleges $26,061 in unpaid debts, $13,000 of which is from a power company. Applicant denies owing this debt. At the hearing, Applicant provided a letter from the power company, which indicated she did not owe any money to it. Subsequent to the hearing, Applicant and her counsel contacted the collection agency listed as the holder of the debt. The collection agency has not provided specific information on the debt. Applicant has challenged the debt, in an effort to determine, what, if any, amount she owes. The majority of the remaining debts, $12,350 worth, concern medical bills for Applicant and her family and are held by one collection agency. $8,998 of the debts are bills attributed to Applicant, $176 to her husband, and $1,663 to her sons. The son\u2019s bills are for medical services provided between August 2004 and January 2006 and are not related to their accident injuries. $3,296 of Applicant\u2019s bills, incurred between May 2005 and December 2005 are connected to her work-related asthma problems. In the past, Applicant paid some money to the collection agency holding the majority of the medical debts listed in the SOR. In March 2009, she started a payment plan with this agency. She agreed to pay $25 a month and make the payment through September 2009. After that the creditor will charge her bank account each month for the monthly payment. She could not pay the creditor\u2019s recent one-time settlement offer. A friend of the Applicant, who works as an auctioneer, recommended Applicant for a clearance as she is trustworthy. Applicant\u2019s employer and co-workers describe her as reliable, efficient, hard working, honest, and dependable. B.

Ashton, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on August 4, 2008. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F on\nJuly 14, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR. She answered the SOR in writing\non July 24, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA\nSeptember 16, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009), (concurring\nand dissenting, in part).\nGE 1; Tr. 48, 128-129 \n2\n2\nreceived the request on July 27, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non July 31, 2009, and I received the case assignment on August 5, 2009. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on August 10, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nAugust 18, 2009. The government offered six exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were\nreceived and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and one witness\ntestified on her behalf. She submitted eight exhibits (AE) A through H, which were\nreceived and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) on August 25, 2009. I held the record open until September 1, 2009, to\nallow Applicant to submit additional matters.  On September 2, 2009, Applicant\u2019s\ncounsel requested  a one week extension of time to submit the additional matters. I\ngranted the request in an Order dated September 3, 2009. Applicant timely submitted\nAE I through AE O, without objection. The record closed on September 8, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant requested an expedited hearing. In light of this request, Applicant\naffirmatively waived her right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice of the\nhearing. (Tr. 9.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b -\n1.m, 1.r, 1.v - 1.z, 1.cc - 1.gg, 1.kk, and 1.oo of the SOR, with explanations. She denied\nthe factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.n - 1.q, 1.s - 1.u, 1.aa, 1.bb, 1.hh - 1.jj, 1.ll - 1.nn, and\n1.pp - 1.vv of the SOR.  She also provided additional information to support her request\n1\nfor eligibility for a security clearance.\n  \nApplicant, who is 39 years old, works as a truck driver for a Department of\nDefense (DoD) contractor, a position she has held since July 2008. Her interim DOD\nsecurity clearance has been withdrawn and she is currently not working. She held a\nsecurity clearance with the Department of the Treasury for one year without incident.2\nApplicant married her first husband in 1987 and they divorced 18 months later.\nThey had one daughter, who is now 23 years old and married.

They had two sons, who are 20 and 18. Her former husband is\ncurrently paying her $108 a month for child support. In the past, she did not receive\nregular child support from her sons\u2019 father, who owes her $17,000 in unpaid child\nsupport.4\nApplicant married her current husband in 1995. While they have no children, he\nhelped raise and provide financial support for her children. Her sons reside at home, but\nApplicant\u2019s daughter does not. Applicant has one grandchild.5\nIn 1991, while married to her first husband, Applicant\u2019s house burned. As a\nresult, she received funding for low income housing under Section 8 housing.  She\n6\nrented property from 1991 until 1998. At the time she vacated this rental property, she\nbelieved all her rents had been paid and all required repairs were completed and paid.7\nIn 1993, Applicant attended a local college and culinary institute. She worked as\na sous chef until November 1998. She earned $8 an hour in this position. While at work\nin November 1998, she received a telephone call from her sister, advising that her\nyoung daughter tried to commit suicide. Over the next several years, numerous\nproblems occurred with her daughter, including several more attempts to commit\nsuicide, removal from the home because her daughter injured Applicant\u2019s younger son,\nand special education classes. Because doctors diagnosed Applicant\u2019s daughter as\nbipolar, she received many services to manage her daughter\u2019s medical treatment.\nDoctors diagnosed Applicant\u2019s younger son with attention deficit disorder. As a result of\nthese problems and her concerns about leaving her daughter alone, Applicant decided\nto stop working and stay home with her children.8\n\nId.  at 27-32.\n9\nGE 5; Tr. 30, 53-62, 160, 164.\n10\nGE 5; Tr. 160-164, 185-186.\n11\nAE A; Tr. 38-39, 53- 55, 61-62, 160.\n12\nTr. 37-39.\n13\n4\nFor a period of time, Applicant\u2019s husband worked two jobs as a trucker. The local\nsteel mill eventually offered him a full-time job which he accepted in 1998. In 2000,\nApplicant\u2019s husband injured his back on the job. He remained away from his job for\nthree months. During this time, he did not receive any salary or worker\u2019s compensation\npayments, as a dispute arose about whether the contractor or subcontractor, for whom\nhe worked, would pay. He returned to work against his doctor\u2019s advice because his\nfamily needed his income.9\nWith no income for three months, Applicant and her husband did not pay their\nbills. They filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in February 2001. Applicant and her husband\nmade approximately $12,000 in payments during the bankruptcy. In September 2002,\nher husband collapsed because of problems related to his earlier back injury, and he\ncould no longer work. Applicant\u2019s husband had surgery on his back in November\n2002.  \n10\nThe bankruptcy included her mortgage. The bank had started foreclosure\nproceedings, which had ceased with the filing of the Chapter 13 filing. During the\nbankruptcy proceedings, her bankruptcy attorney filed a civil suit against the bank.  She\nand the bank resolved this legal action with her providing the bank with title to the house\nand a determination she owed no additional money on the house. Applicant\u2019s husband\nthen purchased a two-bedroom trailer for $2,300, where the family started living in\n2002.11\nApplicant\u2019s husband did not receive worker\u2019s compensation for a significant\nperiod of time following the reoccurrence of his injury. As a result, they could not make\nany additional payments under their bankruptcy plan and got behind in their bills. The\ncourt dismissed their case on March 18, 2003. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney told\nthem that they could not file a Chapter 7 petition following the dismissal of the Chapter\n13 case. After the dismissal of the bankruptcy petition, Applicant\u2019s husband began\nreceiving 80% of his salary as his worker\u2019s compensation benefit.12\nApplicant and her husband received a $15,000 settlement from their car\ninsurance carrier in 2003. Applicant enrolled in a four-month truck driving training\nprogram in August 2003. They paid this program\u2019s cost of $9,000 with their settlement\nmoney and used the remaining $6,000 to pay some of their accumulated bills. Applicant\ngraduated from this program in December 2003.  \n13\n\nId. 36, 39-49.\n14\nId. 132-134.\n15\nId. 40-42.\n16\nTr. 138-142, 192.\n17\nThis amount includes unpaid medical bills not listed in the SOR. See AE G. \n18\nAE D; Tr. 97-100, 132-134, 192.\n19\n5\nUpon completion of her truck driving training, Applicant returned to work in\nDecember 2003 as a truck driver. Over the next few years, Applicant worked for a\nnumber of trucking companies. She left two truck driving jobs because she could not\nearn a living. She drove long-distance for one company and left this job to drive locally\ndue to family issues.14\nIn 2004, Appellant\u2019s husband settled his initial worker\u2019s compensation claim for\n$21,000. He purchased a larger, used trailer for the family home for $18,000 and paid\nsome medical bills. They placed the trailer on a rental lot.15\nIn May 2005, Applicant\u2019s employer provided her with a truck that contained mold.\nBecause she has asthma, she suffered a severe allergic reaction to the mold. She\nmissed work for four months. During this time, her husband\u2019s back injury continued to\nprevent him from working. Applicant incurred medical bills to treat her asthma, which\nshe submitted for worker\u2019s compensation payment. Her worker\u2019s compensation case\nremains unresolved, as do these bills.16\nIn August 2006, Applicant\u2019s husband settled his second worker\u2019s compensation\ncase for $310,000. They purchased a house and land in a rural area for $155,000 cash.\nThey purchased a used car for $22,000. Because of her husband\u2019s back injury, they\ninstalled a pool for $16,000, which provided therapy for his back, and purchased a\nspecial bed for $6,000. They furnished the house as they had little usable furniture.\nThey paid $7,800 for her mother\u2019s funeral and placed $50,000 in a retirement annuity.\nAfter these cash purchases, $43,000 remained.  Applicant did not explain why this\n17\nmoney was not used to pay those medical bills not covered by worker\u2019s compensation\nand incurred through December 2006. However, the tax return discussion infra may\nexplain her financial decisions.  \n18\nAfter moving to their new house in 2006, Applicant and her husband rented their\ntrailer under a rent-to-own contract. Under the terms of the contract, the prospective\npurchasers agreed to pay the property taxes on the trailer. The prospective purchasers\nfailed to pay the property taxes and moved. The trailer is for sale. Applicant recently\nlearned she is responsible for the unpaid taxes for the years 2007 and 2008. She made\narrangements to pay the tax debt of $2,128 over the next year. She paid the initial $720\npayment on August 17, 2009. Under the payment plan, she agreed to pay $194 a month\nfor the next 11 months.  \n19\n\nTr. 118, 190.\n20\nTr. 34, 48-53.\n21\nId. 50-53, 193.\n22\nAE F; Tr. 113-119.\n23\nAE I; AE J; AE K..\n24\n6\nIn December 2006, Applicant\u2019s teenage sons sustained serious injuries in a car\naccident. Her younger son nearly died in this accident. She incurred medical bills for\ntheir treatment. At the present time, a civil lawsuit is pending. The court has not set a\ntrial date for this case. The parties are discussing possible settlement, but the terms of\nany settlement have not been decided.  \n20\nThe doctors released Applicant\u2019s husband to return to work in January 2008.\nThey decided to work as a husband and wife driving team. Since his return to work, one\nof their jobs involved transporting millions of dollars for the Department of Treasury,\nwhich they did without incident. Because the job required them to carry a sawed-off\nshotgun and a 9 millimeter gun, as well as ride in a bulletproof truck, Applicant and her\nhusband found the job very stressful. They decided to end this job.  \n21\nAfter discussions with other truckers, including husband and wife teams, a review\nof costs, and several months of consideration, Applicant and her husband decided to\npurchase a truck tractor in May 2009. They determined they could earn more money as\nowner-operators. Their truck cost $130,000. They paid $57,000 as a down payment and\nanticipate repaying their loan in two and one-half years.  \n22\nApplicant projected their monthly income from owning and operating their truck at\n$15,000 to $20,000 a month. Using $16,000 as their income, she determined that their\nmonthly expenses for operating the truck and paying the truck payment would be\napproximately $11,002 and their household monthly expenses would be $4,001, leaving\napproximately $997 a month. Her household budget includes two debt repayment plans,\nbut not the monthly tax debt payment of $194.Their retirement annuity has been cashed\nto pay bills, as Applicant and her husband cannot work until the clearance issue is\nresolved.23\nApplicant submitted her tax returns for 2006, 2007 and 2008. Her 2006 tax return\nindicates gross income of $22,000 and a zero taxable income. Her 2007 tax return\nindicates gross income of $25,211, a zero taxable income, and $16,560 in medical bills\npaid in 2007. Her 2008 tax return indicates gross income of $50,671, taxable income of\n$7,314, and $13,567 in medical bills paid in 2008.24\nThe SOR alleged $26,061 in unpaid debts. Allegation 1.hh referenced a power\ncompany debt of $13,000, which Applicant denied owing. At the hearing, Applicant\nprovided a letter from the power company, which indicated she did not owe any money\n\nSOR; AE C; AE G; AE M; AE O.\n25\nResponse to SOR; AE B; AE L; AE N: Tr. 83-83, 205. \n26\n7\nto it. Subsequent to the hearing, Applicant and her counsel contacted the collection\nagency listed as the holder of the debt. The collection agency has not provided specific\ninformation on this debt. Applicant has challenged the debt, in an effort to determine,\nwhat, if any, amount she owes. The majority of the remaining debts, $12,350, concerns\nmedical bills for Applicant and her family and held by one collection agency. Applicant\nbelieved many of these bills are related to her worker\u2019s compensation claim and her\nsons\u2019 automobile accident. Based on Applicant\u2019s evidence, the medical bills in the SOR\nbreakdown as follows:\nApplicant:\n$8,998 (Allegations 1.c - 1.n, 1.s - 1.u, 1.aa,\n1.bb, 1.dd, 1.ee, 1.jj, 1.ll, and 1.oo - 1.rr.)\nHusband:\n$176 (Allegations 1.mm and 1.nn)\nSons:\n$235 and $1,428 (Allegations 1.r, 1.v - 1.z, 1.cc, 1.ff, and 1.gg)\nApplicant\u2019s evidence indicates that her sons\u2019 bills are for medical services provided\nbetween August 2004 and January 2006 and are not related to their accident injuries,\nas she believed. I find that her bills between May 2005 and December 2005 are\nconnected to her work-related asthma problems. These bills total $3,296 (allegations\n1.n, 1.s, 1.t, 1.aa, 1.bb, and 1.rr.). I am unable to determine if any of her medical bills\nincurred in 2006, 2007 and 2008 are related to her worker\u2019s compensation case. Two\nmedical bills are her husband\u2019s and were incurred while he did not work.25\nApplicant paid the debts listed in SOR allegations 1.ii, 1.kk, and 1.ss. Applicant\nrequested verification from the hospital that she paid the debts in allegations 1.b and\n1.tt, which she believes are duplications of the same debt. She verified a payment to the\nhospital in July 2009, under her patient number, which is not the same as the creditor\u2019s\nnumber. The hospital has not responded to her request to confirm her bills are paid. In\nthe past, Applicant paid some money to the collection agency holding the majority of the\nmedical debts listed in the SOR. In March 2009, she started a payment plan with this\ncreditor. She agreed to pay $25 a month and made the payment through September\n2009. In the future, the creditor will charge her bank account each month for the\nmonthly payment. She could not pay the creditor\u2019s recent one-time settlement offer.26\nOne witness testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. The witness, an auctioneer, and\nApplicant met when Applicant worked selling items at flea markets between 1998 and\n2002. The witness requested Applicant to work as a \u201cpicker\u201d because Applicant could\nselect appropriate items for auction. The witness and Applicant developed a strong\nfriendship. The witness trusted Applicant to care for her elderly mother, as the witness\nlived many miles away. Applicant never betrayed this trust by taking money, furnishings\nor any items from the home of the witness\u2019s mother. She recommended Applicant for a\n\nAE E; Tr. 197-203.\n27\n8\nclearance as she is trustworthy. Applicant\u2019s employer and co-workers described her as\nreliable, efficient, hard working, honest, and dependable. Friends described her in\nsimilar positive terms.27\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \n\n9\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt when her husband sustained\nan on-the-job injury and did not receive worker\u2019s compensation payments immediately.\nShe was unable to pay her obligations for a period of time as the family lacked sufficient\nincome. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose when her husband injured his back at work in 2000. Her medical\nbills continued to accumulate and some remain unpaid. This mitigating condition does\nnot apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems began when her husband injured his back at work in 2000, did not work for\nthree months, and did not receive worker\u2019s compensation benefits. Her husband re-\ninjured his back in 2002, causing him to stop working for more than five years. For\nsometime after his injury, he did not receive any worker\u2019s compensation benefits. In\n2005, Applicant missed four months from her job for a work-related injury. These\n\n10\ninjuries and the resulting loss of income are beyond her control. Most of the\naccumulated debts from this period of time are paid, except some of the medical bills.\nApplicant worked at paying the bills she could and obtained a new job skill to help earn\nan income for the family. She acted reasonably under the circumstances. This\nmitigating condition applies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant did not receive financial counseling.\nThis mitigating condition is not applicable.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant paid\nseveral smaller bills listed in the SOR. She has developed a payment plan for the\nunpaid medical bills and two debts not listed in the SOR. Since her husband\u2019s injuries in\n2000 and 2002, Applicant has worked diligently, and continues to work, to resolve all\nthe unpaid bills. She has made major progress in her debt resolution. Her finances are\nsound. This mitigating condition partially applies.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue\u201d applies to allegation 1.hh. The power company confirmed that Applicant does not\nowe it any money. Applicant rightfully challenged the validity of this debt with the\ncreditor. In addition, since more than $3,000 of the debt listed are connected to\nApplicant\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation case, her denial of these debts is legitimate as the\ndebts should be paid as part of her claim. Her medical bills for her worker\u2019s\ncompensation case have been referred for payment.\nFinally, AG \u00b6 20 (f) \u201cthe affluence resulted from a legal source of income\u201d must\nbe considered. Applicant\u2019s husband received a large sum of money in 2006. He\nreceived this money when he settled his second worker\u2019s compensation case. This\nmoney came from a legal source and explains why Applicant\u2019s debts are not larger.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\n11\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nunpaid medical bills are significant. The remaining unpaid taxes and telephone bill are\nnot large and will be resolved shortly. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began when her\nhusband injured himself at work and could not work for three months in 2000. During\nthis period of time, Applicant did not work because of serious issues with her daughter\nand younger son, and her husband received no income or worker\u2019s compensation\nbenefits. They filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition to stabilize their finances and help\nthem repay their debts. They did not achieve their goal as her husband suffered a\nserious relapse of his prior back injury in September 2002, which prevented him from\nworking for more than five years. The bankruptcy petition was dismissed and their\nhouse returned to the bank.\nThe loss of income and their house forced Applicant and her family to live in a\nsmall trailer for two years. In 2003, their finances began to improve somewhat. With the\nmoney her husband received from insurance, Applicant received training to return to the\nworkplace to help contribute to the household costs. They also paid some bills.\nApplicant returned to the work place in December 2003. Some months later, her\nhusband received a $21,000 settlement in his first work injury case. He used most of\nthis money to buy a larger trailer for the family housing and paid some bills. \nOver the next two years, Applicant\u2019s income fluctuated because some jobs failed\nto pay a reasonable income, if at all. In 2005, she missed four months from work\nbecause of her work-related injury. Throughout this period of time, Applicant and her\nhusband paid their basic bills, but did not resolve all their medical bills. They did not live\nbeyond their financial means; rather they lived simply, trying to manage their family\nissues and finances. The problems with her daughter and younger son placed\nsignificant demands on the family.\n\n12\nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s husband received a large settlement for his second work-\nrelated back injury. They used this money wisely, not foolishly. They purchased a\nhouse, not a luxury house, which allowed them to move out of their trailer. Because the\npreceding years had been lean, they needed basic furniture for their new house. The\nseverity of her husband\u2019s back injury necessitated the purchase of an expensive bed\nand a pool for exercise. As they live in a rural area, a club with a pool is not available\nnearby. Their purchases, which are not extravagant, reflect a consideration for housing\nstability for their family and providing basic life needs. They did not use this money to\nbuy expensive vacations, boats, jewelry, or other luxury items.\nOver the last few years, Applicant and her husband strived to attain family\nstability and financial security after years of poverty-level living and financial instability.\nTheir income rose above the poverty level between 2006 and 2008. During this time,\nthey paid $30,000 in medical bills. They made financial choices that they believed best\nserved their family, without resorting to overuse of credit cards or loans to buy goods\nthey could not afford. Applicant and her husband think about how to spend their money\nand do so wisely. She is resolving the outstanding medical bills slowly. Thus, these bills\ncannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not simply\nwhether all her debts are paidBit is whether her financial circumstances raise concerns\nabout her fitness to hold a security clearance. While some debts remain unpaid, they\nare insufficient to raise security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) Applicant and her\nhusband transported millions of dollars for the Department of the Treasury, without\nattempting to take any of this money to help themselves. Her witness trusted Applicant\nto care for her elderly mother and her trust was well placed. In looking at the totality of\nthe hardships Applicant has endured in the last 11 years and her response to her\ndifficulties, there is little likelihood or concern that Applicant would betray the trust given\nto her as a Department of Defense contractor.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her finances under\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\n\n13\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.aa:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.bb:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.cc:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.dd:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ee:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ff:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.gg:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.hh:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ii:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.jj:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.kk:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ll:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.mm:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.nn:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.oo:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.pp:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.qq:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.rr:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ss:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.tt:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.uu:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.vv:\nFor Applicant\n\n14\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F\non July 28, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 10, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on August 26, 2009. Applicant retained counsel and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request and Department\nMay 28, 210\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted). The guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See\nISCR Case No. 08-06605 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010); ISCR Case No. 08-07290 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 17,\n2009).\n2\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on September 4, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on January 14, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 2,\n2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 23, 2010. The Government\noffered eight exhibits (GE), 1 through 5 and GE 8, which were received and admitted\ninto evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted 16\nexhibits (AE), A through Q, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 18, 2010. I held\nthe record open until March 25, 2010, for Applicant to submit additional matters.\nApplicant timely submitted AE R through AE BB, without objection. The record closed\non March 25, 2010.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on February 9, 2010, less than 15 days\nbefore the hearing. (Tr. 8.) I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the\nDirective to 15 days notice before the hearing. After consulting with counsel, Applicant\naffirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Id.) \nEvidentiary ruling\nDepartment Counsel offered GE 6, which is a SOR issued on May 27, 2009, and\nGE 7, Applicant\u2019s answer to GE 6, dated June 30, 2009, arguing that Applicant\u2019s\ncomments in his prior answer were relevant. Applicant\u2019s counsel objected to the\nadmission of these exhibits on the grounds that the Government withdrew the SOR and\ntherefore, Applicant\u2019s answer was withdrawn.  (Tr. 18-27) I admitted these exhibits,\nindicating I would determine the weight to be assign to the exhibits. (Tr. 117-120)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c,\n1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l-1.p, 1.s, and 1.t. His admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.h, 1.k, 1.q, and 1.r of\nthe SOR.  He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for\n1\na security clearance. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I\nmake the following additional findings of fact.  \n\nGE 1; AE A; AE B; AE C.\n2\nGE 1; Tr. 34-35.\n3\nAE R; Tr. 35-38.\n4\n3\nApplicant, who is 40 years old, works as a security supervisor for a Department\nof Defense contractor. He began his current position in September 2007. Two previous\nmanagers wrote letters of recommendation. They describe him as professional, detail\noriented, honest, loyal, ethical, and diligent. Both recognized him as an asset to his\nemployer. One suggested that he apply for new positions in his field and provided\nrecommendations whenever he did. His brother expressed gratitude for all that\nApplicant has provided to the family through his example and support of family\nmembers. Applicant served seven and one-half years in the United States Army.2\nApplicant married in 1995 and divorced in 1999. His daughter from his marriage\nis 14 years old. He has sole custody of his daughter and provides for her financial and\nemotional support. His former wife has little contact with his daughter and provides\nsporadic child support. The court ordered his former wife to pay him $455 a month in\nchild support, but she does not pay the child support regularly.3\nSometime ago, his daughter was involved in an automobile accident. Several\nyears after the accident, she starting experiencing seizures, which required ongoing\nmedical treatment. He paid all medical costs, not covered by insurance. More recently,\nApplicant developed a medical problem, the nature of which he declined to reveal. His\nmedical problem requires him to take monthly medications, which cost him $70 a\nmonth. His mother is suffering from terminal cancer, and with the help of his siblings, he\nis providing emotional support and helping her with decision-making.4\nApplicant lived in State A from 1998 until August 2005. He lived near a United\nStates military base, and rented houses from service members stationed out of the\narea. When the owners returned, he moved. In 2001, he began employment with a\nnational company, working about one-hour from his home. In January 2005, he moved\nhis home base closer to his workplace, to be nearer his daughter to take her for medical\ntreatment of her seizures. In August 2008, his job transferred him to State B, about\n1,000 miles away. Applicant selected a less expensive place to live in State B, only to\nrealize that the location was not good for his daughter. After one year, he moved to a\nbetter location. Six months after this move, in February 2007, his employer transferred\nhim to a position in State C, about 500 miles from State B. His employer paid for one of\nthese moves. Since his current position was a two-hour drive from his residence in\nState C, Applicant moved closer to his work in September 2007. Between 1998 and\n2007, he moved at least eight times. The cost of moving so many times had a\ncumulative impact on his finances.\nWhen Applicant began his employment with the national company in 2001, he\nearned $8 an hour. When he ended his employment with this company, he earned\n\nGE 5; AE S; Tr. 34, 66, 77-78.\n5\nGE 2 (Credit report, dated September 10, 2008); GE 3 (Credit report, dated December 5, 2008); GE 4 (Credit\n6\nreport, dated March 27, 2008).\nApplicant established that he made at least two payments, one in October 2009 and one in February 2010.\n7\n4\n$40,000 a year. His salary with his current employer started at $60,000 a year. He now\nearns $64,000 a year. His net monthly income totals $3,233, and his monthly expenses\naverage $2,860.5\nThe SOR identified 20 purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit\nreports from 2008 and 2009, totaling approximately $35,670. Some accounts have been\ntransferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts\nare referenced repeatedly in both credit reports, in many instances duplicating other\naccounts listed, either under the same creditor or collection agency name or under a\ndifferent creditor or collection agency name. Some accounts are identified by complete\naccount numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in some\ninstances eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits.\nAfter reviewing the credit reports dated August 13, 2008, February 7, 2009,\nMarch 26, 2009, February 22, 2010, and the SOR, I have compiled a list of the total\ndebts owed, excluding any duplicate entries. I find that Appellant\u2019s actual debts are as\nfollows:6\nSOR \u00b6\nTYPE OF DEBT\nAMOUNT\nSTATUS\nEVIDENCE\n1.a\nMedical\n$       46.00\nPaid\nAE Q, p.4\n1.b\nCar loan\n$  7,375.00\nPayment plan;\n$50 a month7\nAE AA; Tr. 41-42\n1.c\nLoan\n$     585.00\nDisputes,\nunknown to him\nTr. 42\n1.d\nEducation loan\n$  1,296.00\nPayment plan;\none payment\nAE Z; Tr. 45-46\n1.e\nRent\n$  3,444.00\nSame as 1.n;\ndisputed, this debt \nremoved by one\ncredit reporting\ncompany \nAE J; Tr. 46\n1.f\nUtility\n$  1,188.00\nDisputed \nAE U; Tr. 47-48\n1.g\nLoan\n$     142.00\nPaid\nGE 5; AE L; AE Q;\nAE Y\n\nThe credit report shows name of the collection agent for medical provider.

He disputed four debts listed in the SOR, totaling $2,491. He does not\nrecognize the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b and denies having insurance with the company listed in\nSOR \u00b6 1.t. He paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l, and denies owing the utility debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f\nbecause he did not live at the address or in the state during the time frame given for\nincurring this debt. He continues to dispute the debt.  Applicant developed payment\n9\nplans for the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.n. He provided some proof of\npayment, but has not provided documentation showing that he is making regular\n\nAE W ; AE Z; AE AA; Tr. 41-42, 45-48, 51-52.\n10\nGE 5; AE M; AE N; AE O; AE P; Tr. 58-60.                                                      \n11\n6\nmonthly payments on these debts. He made at least one payment on the debt in SOR \u00b6\n1.j. However, he disagrees with the balance and is currently working with the creditor to\nreach an agreement on what he actually owes.10\nApplicant received interrogatories from the Government around March 1, 2009.\nHe submitted, with his answer, documents showing that he paid three debts listed in the\ninterrogatories, plus evidence of one additional education loan payment. After receipt of\nthe interrogatories and before the issuance of a SOR, Applicant disputed a number of\ndebts, and retained the services of a debt counseling firm to assist in the resolution of\nhis debts. Through this company, he received debt counseling, which taught him how to\nmanage his money, plan out his finances, and stick to his financial plan. He does not\nrely on the child support payments to pay monthly bills. He developed a payment plan\nwith this company and began paying $315 a month March 2009. This company agreed\nto work with him on the resolution of nine debts listed in the SOR. After eight months of\npayment, Applicant dissolved his working relationship with this company, as none of his\ndebts had been paid or resolved. The company returned about $300 of his payments to\nhim. He started paying his debts on his own, and he is current on his monthly bills.  \n11\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n7\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some\nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying\nconditions.\nIn assessing whether an Applicant has established mitigation under Guideline F,\nthe Appeal Board provided the following guidance in ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3\n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008):\n\n8\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 200). However, an applicant is not\nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can\nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and\nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the\nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd.\nApr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually\npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the\nSOR.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s debts are recent and\nsome are ongoing. This mitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems arose from a variety of issues, including his divorce, low income, unexpected\nmedical expenses, multiple moves, and unpaid child support. Applicant and his wife\ndivorced in 1999 and he received sole custody of their daughter. The court directed his\nwife to pay him child support, but she has not paid it regularly. Since their divorce, he\nhas worked regularly, but not at high income jobs. Over the last nine years, he has\nworked to improve his earnings through education and better jobs. He incurred schools\nloans to pay for his education and has paid all but one of these loans. He rented\nproperty from military personnel who were on assignment elsewhere. When these\nindividuals returned, he would move. When his daughter\u2019s seizures began, he moved\nthem closer to his work to be quickly available to help her. Twice in two years, his job\nrequired him to move, resulting in moving expenses on one occasion. He developed a\nmedical problem, requiring month medication, which costs him $70 a month and\n\nAG \u00b6 20(f) is not applicable to this case. \n12\n9\nlessens the available money for debt repayment. He moved closer to his current job,\ncutting a two-hour commute and reducing his commuting costs. All these circumstances\nhave impacted Applicant\u2019s finances and his ability to repay all his old debts. He acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances in which he found himself. This mitigating condition\npartially applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant retained the services of a debt\ncounseling firm to help him with repaying his debts in March 2009. Through this service,\nhe received debt counseling, which he described as helpful. He learned to manage his\nmoney, plan his expenses, and stick to his financial plan. Although he ended his\nworking relationship with this company after making monthly payments for about eight\nmonths because the company failed to pay his debts, he continues to follow the\nfinancial advice he received. He has resolved 12 of his SOR debts, totaling $19,400,\nand lives within his monthly income. He also developed payment plans for four other\ndebts and has made at least some payments on these plans. He is financially able to\nmeet his regular monthly living expenses. This mitigating condition applies.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant\narranged a payment plan in March 2009 on the judgment. He recently paid the\nremaining balance on this debt. Since receiving the interrogatories, he has contacted\nthe creditors for his small debts and paid the debts through payments plans or in full.\nThis mitigating condition applies to the debts in SOR allegations 1.g, 1.I, 1.k, 1.m, 1.p,\n1.q, 1.r, and 1.s.\nFinally, under AG \u00b6 20(e), mitigation can be established when \u201cthe individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of\nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Applicant disputes four debts listed in\nthe SOR. One debt (1.c) is unknown to him, and he never obtained car insurance with\nthe company in SOR allegation 1.t. Thus, his decision not to pay these debts is\nreasonable. He did not live at the address, or in the location, at the time the utility\ncompany claims he incurred a substantial bill, thus, his decision to dispute this debt is\nreasonable. He paid the one remaining debt sometime ago and does not wish to pay\nthe debt a second time. Applicant\u2019s reason for challenging these debts are reasonable.\nThis mitigation condition applies to SOR allegations 1.c, 1.f, 1.l, and 1.t.12\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\n\n10\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or deny a\nsecurity clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to Applicant under the\nwhole-person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\ndeveloped significant financial problems after he divorced and assumed total financial\nresponsibility for his daughter. In addition, he earned limited income after leaving the\nmilitary and did not receive child support as he should have. Medical problems\ncontributed to his financial problems. \nDuring all this time, Applicant sought to better himself through education and\ntraining. He accepted better jobs, even those which required him to move long\ndistances. His current job provided him with a $20,000 increase in his gross income and\na significant increase in net pay. With this additional income, Applicant began working\non resolving his old debts. By early 2009, he had resolved two education loans. When\nhe answered the interrogatories in March 2009, he provided information, showing that\nhe had paid several debts and that he had retained a debt counseling company to help\nwith his debt resolution. He recognized that he needed to resolve his old debts and\nassumed responsibility for them. For over two years, Applicant has worked to pay his\npast due debts, one at a time, and has established a track record for debt resolution. He\nchallenged debts he did not believe were his. If the credit reporting company\ndetermined the debt was his, he paid it. His efforts have resulted in a significant\nreduction of his debt. He still has debts to pay. He has paid some money on these debts\nand with the payment of other debts recently, he has additional funds  available to\n\n11\ncontinue with his payment plans on these debts. Given his two-year track record for the\nresolution of his debts and his credible statement that he has payment plans in place for\nthese debts, it is reasonable to assume that he will continue to pay these debts.\nApplicant has focused his attention on providing for his daughter. He has learned\nto manage his money and plan his financial expenses. Most significantly, he has taken\naffirmative action to pay or resolve most of the delinquent debts raising security\nconcerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) He has not been able to pay all his debts; however, these\nunpaid debts cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is\nnot simply whether all his debts are paid: it is whether his financial circumstances raise\nconcerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. While some debts remain\nunpaid, they are insufficient to raise security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) Applicant\u2019s\nsignificant efforts over the last two years to reduce his debts outweighs the fact that\nseveral debts are not paid in full.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances under\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on March 11, 2009. On July \n27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guideline B. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006.  \n \nJune 17, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on August 28, 2009; answered it on October 26, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on October 29, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February \n1, 2010, and the case was assigned to me on the following day. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on March 23, 2010, scheduling the hearing to be conducted by video \nteleconference on March 29, 2010. On March 25, 2010, the notice of hearing was \namended to change the time of day for the videoconference. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of one witness, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 6, 2010. \n \nNotice of Hearing \n \n \nAlthough Department Counsel and Applicant corresponded by email for several \nweeks before the hearing, the formal, written hearing notice was dated March 23, 2010, \nonly six days before the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived the 15-day written notice \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. (Tr. 16-17.) \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Iraq. The request and the documents attached as enclosures were not admitted \nin evidence but are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I.

He has \nworked for his current employer since May 2008, and he has been supporting U.S. \nforces in Iraq since June 2009. He participated in the video teleconference from Iraq. \n(Tr. 41-42.) He has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iraq. He completed his mandatory military service in the \nIraqi Army in 1987. He worked as a self-employed engineer, architect, and designer in \nIraq from 1987 to 1991. He then worked for the Kurdish Relief Association, a non-\ngovernmental agency devoted to rebuilding the Kurdish regions of northern Iraq, from \n1991 to 1996. He married an Iraqi citizen in September 1993. (GX 2 at 3.) \n \nApplicant, his mother, his spouse, and his son were among the thousands of \nIraqi Kurds who fled from Iraq and sought asylum in the United States. He and his \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfamily fled Iraq and temporarily resided in Guam from December 1996 to March 1997, \nwhen the U.S. military brought them to the United States. (GX 2 at 3.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are deceased. (GX 2 at 7.) \nHis four brothers, a half-brother, and a half-sister are citizens and residents of Iraq. His \noldest brother, a businessman involved in agricultural products, was a local party \nrepresentative, but he is no longer involved in local politics. (Tr. 29.) They have \ntelephonic contact every three or fourth months. (GX 2 at 6.) His second oldest brother \nis a dual citizen of Iraq and Austria and a self-employed farmer, and they have contact \nabout twice a year. His third oldest brother is an Iraqi citizen, also working as a self-\nemployed farmer, and they have telephonic contact every three or four months. His \nyoungest brother is a sales representative for an air conditioning company, and they \nhave contact every five or six months. Applicant\u2019s half-brother is a local government \ninspector, and they have contact about twice a year. His half-sister is a homemaker and \nnot employed outside the home, and they have contact about once a year. His half-\nbrother, half-sister, and all his brothers except the oldest reside in the semi-autonomous \nKurdish regions in northern Iraq. (GX 2 at 5-7; AX A at 1.) \n \nApplicant maintains contact with a high school friend who is now a self-employed \nbuilding contractor. They lost contact in 1996, but since 2002 they have had contact \nevery six or eight months. (GX 2 at 7-8.) \n \nApplicant, his spouse, mother, and two children traveled to Iraq in October and \nNovember 2000 to attend the funeral of a half-brother and to visit his relatives. Applicant \ntraveled by himself to Iraq in December 2004 and remained there until March 2005 to \nattend the funeral of his father-in-law and to visit his relatives and his high school friend. \n(GX 2 at 4, 7-8; AX A at 2.) Applicant\u2019s mother, spouse, and children traveled to Iraq in \n2009 to visit his relatives. (Tr. 26-27.) \n \nApplicant applied for U.S. citizenship in February 2005, and he became a U.S. \ncitizen in April 2008. He renounced his Iraqi citizenship in June 2008. (GX 2 at 11.) His \nmother and son became U.S. citizens in April 2009, and his spouse became a U.S. \ncitizen in May 2009. (GX 2 at 3; AX B, C, and D.)  \n \nApplicant and his family have lived in a rented home in the United States since \n1997. They own no real estate or other assets in Iraq. (Tr. 28, 39.) \n \n \nIn 2004 and 2005, Applicant served as a board member for an Islamic civic \nassociation dedicated to help fellow Iraqi exiles. His organization taught classes, \nprovided social services, and translated documents to help other Iraqi \u00e9migr\u00e9s gain \nemployment, register their children in school, and obtain other community services. (GX \n1 at 15.) \n \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant assisted an Iraqi whom he had never met, by \nhelping him find a place to live and become acquainted with the local Kurdish \ncommunity in the United States. (GX 2 at 8; AX E.) He assisted the Iraqi in response to \n\n \n4 \n \n \na request from a U.S. Army colonel commanding the unit with whom the Iraqi served as \na translator under combat conditions. The Iraqi was highly regarded by the unit \ncommander. (AX E; Tr. 37.)   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s site supervisor since his arrival in Iraq, a retired Air Force master \nsergeant, testified that Applicant is a \u201cmodel linguist.\u201d He is very talented, intelligent, and \nconscientious. She recommended approval of Applicant\u2019s security clearance application \nwithout hesitation. (Tr. 45-46.) \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts about Iraq. In 2003, a \ncoalition led by the United States removed Saddam Hussein and his Ba\u2019athist regime \nfrom power. In March 2006, Iraq\u2019s new government took office after being freely elected \nby the Iraqi people. Despite recent improvements in security, Iraq remains dangerous, \nvolatile, and unpredictable. Remnants of the former Ba\u2019ath regime, transnational \nterrorists, criminal elements, and numerous insurgent groups remain active throughout \nIraq. Terrorists armed and trained by Iran continue to endanger the security and stability \nof Iraq. Foreign terrorists from North Africa and other Middle Eastern countries continue \nto flow into Iraq, primarily through Syria. Al-Queda in Iraq possesses the means to \nlaunch high-profile attacks against Iraqi civilians and infrastructure. Travel in Iraq is \ndangerous. The security situation in the northern Kurdish areas of Iraq is relatively more \nstable that the rest of Iraq, but there are still incidents of violence in the northern areas. \n \nI have also taken notice that the U.S. State Department has substantiated reports \nof human rights abuses in Iraq, including a climate of violence; misappropriation of \nauthority by sectarian, criminal, and insurgent groups; arbitrary killings; torture; and \nother cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Iraqi government\u2019s \neffectiveness in adhering to the rule of law is hampered by ongoing violence, corruption, \nsectarian bias, and lack of oversight and accountability. Treatment of detainees has \nbeen generally poor. The judiciary is weak, and judicial independence is impaired by \nthreats and killings by insurgent, sectarian, tribal, and criminal elements. Security \nthreats hinder access to the courts, and witness intimidation is common. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of an applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s spouse, son, and mother are citizens of Iraq (\u00b6 1.a); \nhis two brothers, half-brother, and half-sister are citizens are residents of Iraq (\u00b6 1.b); \none of his brothers is a local political party official (\u00b6 1.c); another brother is a dual Iraqi-\nAustrian citizen residing in Iraq (\u00b6 1.d); and another brother is a dual Iraqi-German \ncitizen residing in Iraq (\u00b6 1.e). It also alleges Applicant maintains contact with a friend in \n\n \n6 \n \n \nIraq (\u00b6 1.f), sponsored an Iraqi citizen whom he had never met for entry into the United \nStates (\u00b6 1.g), and traveled to Iraq in 2000 and 2004 (\u00b6 1.h).  \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, \n2002). Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United \nStates, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human \nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members \nare vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the United States. In considering the nature of \nthe government, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) \n(reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did not consider \nterrorist activity in area where family members resided). \n \n \nFamily ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, \nautomatically disqualifying under Guideline B. Those family ties must be evaluated, \nhowever, to determine whether they put an applicant at risk of exploitation, pressure or \ncoercion, or have the potential to put an applicant in the position of having to chose \nbetween the interests of family members and the interests of the United States. The \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family \ntie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low \nstandard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. A disqualifying condition \nalso may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, \ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b).  \n \nEven though the United States and Iraq are allies, Applicant\u2019s brothers, half-\nbrother, half sister, and his high school friend are vulnerable to terrorists, insurgents, \nand criminal elements, making Applicant vulnerable to indirect pressure or coercion. \nThe volatile, dangerous conditions in Iraq create the \u201cheightened risk\u201d contemplated by \nAG \u00b6 7(a) and the potential conflict of interest contemplated by AG \u00b6 7(b). Thus, these \ntwo disqualifying conditions are raised. \n \nA security concern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a \nperson or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d AG \u00b6 7(d). \nApplicant\u2019s spouse, mother, and son are citizens and residents of the United States. \nThey have no living family members in Iraq and no financial or political connections to \nIraq. Thus, AG \u00b6 7(d) is not raised. No other enumerated disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline are raised. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s travel to Iraq in 2000 and 2004, and his family\u2019s travel to Iraq in 2009 \nwere to visit his family members in Iraq. As such, that travel has no independent \nsecurity significance. See ISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). \n \n \nSince the Government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). The presence of Applicant\u2019s family members in the volatile and \ndangerous conditions in Iraq precludes application of this mitigating condition. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nApplicant has renounced his Iraqi citizenship. He, his spouse, his mother, and his son \nhave become U.S. citizens. He put himself and his family at risk to resist oppression, \nlawlessness, and terrorism from 1991 to 1996. He came to the United States as a \nrefugee, and he became heavily involved in assisting other Iraqi refugees. He has now \nleft his spouse, mother, and son behind, and again placed himself in harm\u2019s way to \nsupport the interests of the United States. His track record of selfless service \ndemonstrates that he will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign power, \nterrorist organization, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit him. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) \nis established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a \nforeign country are not casual.  ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s contacts with his family members in Iraq are infrequent, he has not \nrebutted the presumption that they are not casual. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. No \nother enumerating mitigating conditions are established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult, who has lived in the United States. \nsince 1997. He has shown great concern for his fellow Kurdish refugees, working with a \ncivic association to assist them, and helping a total stranger to establish a new life in the \nUnited States. He has renounced his Iraqi citizenship and sworn allegiance to the \nUnited States. He has demonstrated his willingness to put himself and his family at risk \nto support the interests of the United States. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my \nobligation to resolve close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nOctober 29, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn October 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nB  for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn December 28, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nFebruary 8, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 4, 2010, and I convened\nthe hearing as scheduled on June 21, 2010, by video teleconference. Because the\nteleconference hearing could not be concluded on that date, it was continued until June\n30, 2010, when the hearing was concluded by video teleconference. The Government\noffered Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received and admitted without objection.   \n\n2\n        Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A and B, at the time\nof hearing, which were also admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr) in two parts, for the two days of hearing, on July 9, 2010. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until July 12, 2010, to submit additional\ndocuments, and Department Counsel had until July 20, 2010 to indicate whether or not\nhe objected to any of the documents. Applicant timely submitted two additional\ndocuments, which have been identified and entered into evidence, collectively without\nobjection as Exhibit C. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and the\ntestimony of Applicant, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts\nrelating to the country of Japan. The request and the attached documents were\nadmitted into evidence as Exhibit 5 . The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted that all of the SOR factual allegations 1.a.\nthrough 1.c., are correct, but denied that these allegations should be a consideration for\na denial of his security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 29 years old. He has been married since 2003. His wife was born in\nJapan. Applicant and his wife have one son with another child on the way. Applicant\nserved in the United States Marine Corps from 1999 to 2003. It was while he was\nserving as a Marine that he met his wife. \nApplicant is employed as a Customer Service Representative by a defense\ncontractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in\nthe defense sector.\n(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe SOR lists three allegations, regarding Foreign Influence, under Adjudicative\nGuideline B, which will be reviewed in the same order as they were listed on the SOR.\nAs stated above, Applicant has admitted all of the allegations listed:\n \n1.a. Applicant's spouse is a resident and citizen of Japan. Applicant testified that\nat the time he was in the process of marrying his wife, he was a member of the United\nStates Marine Corps, and he followed all of the proper procedures before he married\nher. (Tr at 38-41.) Exhibit C includes a letter from Applicant\u2019s Commanding General to\n\n3\nhim, dated April 25, 2003, indicating that Applicant\u2019s request to marry his wife was\ngranted. The documentation also established that Applicant followed all of the\nrequirements for the marriage, including attending a Pre-Marital Counseling Seminar.\n1.b. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law are citizens and\nresidents of Japan. Applicant testified that his father in law is an electrician, his mother-\nin-law is not employed, and his sister-in-law is an office worker for a train station. To his\nknowledge none of them works in any capacity for the Japanese Government. He has\nonly seen his father-in-law and mother-in-law \u201ca couple of times.\u201d His sister-in-law\ncomes to visit their home every other year. Applicant does not communicate with any of\nthem by telephone. His wife speaks to her sister regularly and to her parents\ninfrequently. He indicated that they speak only Japanese and his Japanese is extremely\nlimited. (Tr at 45-47.)\n1.c. Applicant\u2019s spouse is an active member in the Japanese military. Applicant\ntestified that his wife at the time of hearing was a liaison for the Sergeant Major of her\nunit in the Japanese Self Defense Force. Her position involved interpreting documents\nbetween Japanese and English in coordination between the Japanese and United\nStates military.  \nApplicant averred that his wife was in the process of separating from the military,\nand her last day would be June 30, 2010. She served for 16 years, and once her\ntermination is finalized, she will have no future obligation to the Japanese military. It is\nher plan after her separation to stay at their home for at least a year to take care of their\ntwo children. (Tr at 41-43, 51-53, 60-61.) Exhibit C included an \u201cOfficial Notification of\nAppointment/Dismissal,\u201d officially announcing that Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s resignation from the\nJapanese military was approved on June 30, 2010. \nAt the hearing, Applicant reiterated that he started living in Japan during his\nenlistment in the Marine Corps, and after his separation he remained in Japan and\nworked for other companies there. (Tr at 48-50.)\nDuring the second day of the hearing, Applicant testified that all of the members\nof his immediate family, including his parents, two sisters and one brother are all United\nStates citizens and residents. He is planning to apply for a United States Green card for\nhis wife, now that she is no longer in the Japanese military. (Tr(2) at 16-17.)\n Mitigation\nApplicant submitted seven very positive character letters in Exhibit A, from\nindividuals, six of whom know and have known Applicant in a variety of employment\nsituations and one who knew him as a Boy Scout. He was described by his fellow co-\nworker and supervisor who has known him for seven years, as \u201can American thru and\nthru [sic] and a United States patriot without a doubt.\u201d Another supervisor for whom\nApplicant has worked for seven years wrote that Applicant \u201chas shown nothing but the\nhighest level of trustworthiness to the United States Government.\u201d Additionally, he was\n\n4\ndescribed as \u201cfaithful and loyal to the United States\u201d and a \u201ctrustworthy and reliable\nindividual.\u201d\nApplicant also submitted several documents in Exhibit B, establishing that he had\nearned the United States Marine Corps Meritorious Mast in November 2000, two\nCertificates of Commendation in September 2001 and March 2003, the Navy and\nMarine Corps Achievement Medal in January 2002, and the Certificate of Good Conduct\nin September 2002. Finally, he submitted DD Form 214 and his DD 256, establishing\nthat on September 21, 2006, Applicant received an Honorable Discharge from the\nUnited States Marine Corps.  \nCurrent Status of Japan\nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Japan. Japan has a\nconstitutional monarchy with a parliamentary government. In general, Japan has good\nrelations with the United States, has a military alliance with the United States, hosts\nsome United States military forces, and has cooperated with the United States on a\nwide variety of diplomatic, foreign policy, and economic issues.\nIn recent years, the Japanese public has shown increased support for Japan\u2019s\nSelf Defense Forces, and Japan had been moving toward a more independent self\ndefense posture.\nIn 2000, Japan was listed as among the most active collectors of economic and\nproprietary information based upon the survey by the National Counterintelligence\nExecutive of selected Fortune 500 companies. In 2005 and 2007, Japan ranked high on\nthe National Counterintelligence Executive\u2019s list of foreign countries requesting the most\nvisits to United States military facilities. High volume of such visits creates opportunities\nfor foreign intelligence efforts against sensitive United States technologies.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding Foreign Influence: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\n\n6\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Those that could be applicable in this case include the following: AG \u00b6\n7(a) \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend,\nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.\u201d Applicant\u2019s wife, who is a citizen and resident of Japan, and who, until\nrecently, was serving in a foreign military, make AG \u00b6 7(a) a concern to the\nGovernment. I find that AG \u00b6 7(b) \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group. government,\nor country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to\nprotect sensitive information  . . . and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information\u201d is also applicable in this case. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I find that AG \u00b6\n8(b) \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest,\u201d is applicable to this Applicant and controlling for the following reasons:  \nApplicant is a U.S. born citizen, who served honorably in the United States\nMarine Corps for four years. Appellant\u2019s wife has resigned her position in the Japanese\nmilitary. His contact with his in-laws is infrequent, and none of them has any\ninvolvement with the Japanese Government. His immediate family, including his\nparents, two sisters and one brother are solely U.S. born citizens and residents.  Since\nhis separation from the Marine Corps, Applicant has only been employed by United\nStates companies. Finally, I considered the positive character letters Applicant\u2019s behalf\nand his honorable record, while serving as a member of the United States Marine\nCorps. I therefore conclude Guideline B for Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case under Guideline B. Based on all of\nthe reasons cited above as to why Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 8(b) applies, I find that the\nrecord evidence leaves me with no significant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole-person concept. For all\nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c.: For Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 11, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\n\n2\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 10, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board\naffirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that\nhe has 27 delinquent accounts which total approximately $86,707.  She also found that Applicant\nhas eighteen delinquent consumer debts with an approximate total of $14,617.  These debts are listed\nin Applicant\u2019s credit reports.  Applicant also owes delinquent income taxes and he has substantial\nchild support arrearages.  The Judge concluded that while circumstances beyond his control\ncontributed to his financial problems, he has not acted responsibly with regard to resolving his\ndelinquent accounts.  While he has taken action to address some of his debts, Applicant\u2019s unresolved\ndebts raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\nApplicant\u2019s principal assignment of error on appeal is his contention that the Judge\u2019s\nstatement regarding his total indebtedness is incorrect.  He asserts that the amount of his\nindebtedness that was transcribed from an old credit report is incorrect and this error caused the\nJudge to make the decision that he is not trustworthy.  An evaluation of Applicant\u2019s claim is\nhampered by the fact that Applicant, despite making a general reference to an $89,000 figure, does\nnot specify a dollar amount  from a particular credit report that he believes to be in error (there are\nthree credit reports in the record) and he does not indicate what he believes his total amount of\nindebtedness to be.\nThe Judge referenced an $86,000 figure in her decision and indicated that it was obtained\nfrom Applicant\u2019s background investigation.  She went on to make independent findings of fact\nconcerning individual components of Applicant\u2019s debt profile, including child support, rental and\nrelated real estate debts, automobile loans, consumer debts, and taxes.  A review of the record\nevidence leads the Board to conclude that the delinquency amounts stated by the Judge in her\ndecision are supported  by the record evidence.  Applicant has failed to establish error. \nApplicant asserts that he is accomplishing a reduction in his debts.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\n\n3\nconditions and factors. She discussed the applicability of the mitigating factors listed under\nGuidelines F and indicated in some detail why the mitigating conditions either did not apply or\napplied with insufficient strength to ultimately mitigate the security concerns raised in the case.  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient\nto demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that\nthe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs.

On September 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) which became effective within the Department of Defense \non September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn September 27, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nNovember 3, 2009. The case was assigned to me on November 17, 2009. The hearing \nwas originally scheduled for February 10, 2010, but was cancelled because of inclement \nweather. On February 24, 2010, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing \nfor March 19, 2010. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered seven \nexhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 7.

He denies SOR allegations 1.e \u2013 1.i, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.z.   \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \napplying for a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer for \napproximately a year and a half. He held a security clearance when he served on active \nduty in the U.S. Army from 1993 to 2004. He separated as an E-4 with an honorable \ndischarge. He has one year of college. He is married and has three daughters from a \nprevious marriage, age 11 and 12-year-old twins. (Tr at 6-7, 26, 28-29; Gov 1; AE G)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that he has 27 \ndelinquent accounts which total approximately $86,707.  His two largest debts consist of \n$37,848 in past-due child support (SOR \u00b6 1.w: Gov 2 at 6; Gov 7 at 10) and $21,399 \nrelated to an automobile repossession in 2000. (SOR \u00b6 1.u: Gov 1 at 39) Applicant also \nowes $7,414 related to an automobile repossession in 2004. (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 5 at 2; \nGov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 2) Between 1997 to 2006, five judgments have been filed against \nApplicant, an approximate total of $8,429.  The judgments include a $3,817 judgment \nowed to a furniture store in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 4 at 5-6; Gov 6 at 1-2; Gov 7 at \n4); a $392 judgment for a bad check in August 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.n: Gov 4 at 4; Gov 7 at \n4); a $2,356 judgment owed to an individual in June 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.r: Gov 4 at 7);  a \n$1,229 judgment owed to a townhouse community in January 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.s: Gov 4 \nat 8); and a $635 judgment owed to an apartment complex in 1997. (SOR \u00b6 1.t: Gov 4 \nat 1) \n \nApplicant has eighteen delinquent consumer debts, an approximate total of \n$14,617. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.i, 1.k \u2013 1.m, 1.o \u2013 1.q, 1.v, 1.x \u2013 1.aa) These debts are listed \nin Applicant\u2019s credit reports. (Gov 5; Gov 6; Gov 7). During the hearing, Applicant \nindicated that he owes $4,000 in federal income taxes for 2009. He also owed $6,780 \nfor delinquent federal income taxes for tax year 2006. He has been paying $105 a \nmonth to the Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S) during the past year for the 2006 tax \ndebt. The I.R.S. also claims Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns for \n2007. (Tr. 54-55) \n \n\n \n \n \n3\nIn November 2008, Applicant consulted an attorney about filing for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. He did not file because he could not afford to pay the fees. (Tr. 33; Gov 2) \nApproximately half of Applicant\u2019s net salary goes towards his past-due child support. His \nwages were garnished to collect the child support. The child support arrearage has \nbeen reduced from $37,848 to $22,355.  The state will not reduce the amount of \nApplicant\u2019s child support because of the high amount of his past-due child support. (Tr. \n56-59, 65; Gov 2; AE B)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when he separated from active duty in \n2004. He was unable to find suitable employment.  In 2005, he made a foolish decision \nto leave his full-time job to start his own business. The business was not successful. He \nand his wife experienced some financial problems from 2006 to 2008. He was \nunemployed from March 2008 to August 2008. He worked at a temporary employment \nagency for six months but quit when his pay check was garnished for child support. (Tr. \n37-48; Gov 3 at 5)  \n \nAside from his child support payment, Applicant has not resolved any of the other \ndebts alleged in the SOR. He claims all of his extra money goes towards child support. \n(Tr. 83) He has not contacted any of his remaining creditors. (Tr. 83-102)  \n \nAfter the hearing Applicant submitted a budget. His total monthly income after the \nchild support is taken out is $1,644. His wife\u2019s total monthly income is $1,406. Their \ncombined total monthly income is $3,050. Their total monthly expenses are $2,686. \nThey have approximately $364 left over after expenses. (AE E) Applicant indicated that \nhe is in the process of consulting a debt management program and a bankruptcy \nattorney. (AE C; AE D) \n \nA performance evaluation dated March 22, 2010, indicates Applicant meets \nperformance expectations. The evaluation states Applicant is \u201chighly motivated while \nteaching\u201d and has \u201coutstanding potential.\u201d (AE F) \n \nApplicant\u2019s pastor wrote a letter on his behalf noting that Applicant is a faithful, \ncommitted, and loyal leader in the church. His faithfulness, loyalty, character, and \nintegrity is without blemish. (AE A at 1)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n\n \n \n \n4\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find AG &19(a) (an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and AG \n\n \n \n \n5\n&19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. \nApplicant has had financial difficulties since at least 2004. The SOR alleged Applicant \nhad over $86,000 in delinquent accounts.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long \nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) is not applicable. Applicant has encountered financial problems for a number \nof years. The SOR alleges 27 delinquent accounts. It was also discovered during the \nhearing that Applicant owes the I.R.S. for past due taxes. While Applicant is working \nwith the I.R.S. on this issue, his past due tax debts further demonstrate Applicant\u2019s \nirresponsibility towards his finances. Applicant\u2019s unresolved debts raise questions about \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nAG & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. When Applicant separated \nfrom the military in 2004, he encountered several periods of unemployment or under \nemployment. In 2006, he quit his job to pursue his own business which was not \nsuccessful. Several factors beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial \nsituation. However, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply the individual must have acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. His decision to quit his full-time to job to open a business was \nquestionable. He admits to quitting one job when he discovered his wages were being \ngarnished for child support. While Applicant is making his child support payments \nthrough garnishment at present, he neglected his child support responsibilities for years \nwhich resulted in the high child support arrearages. One of his larger accounts, the \n$21,399 automobile repossession occurred in 2000. While he consulted a bankruptcy \nattorney in November 2009, he did not follow through with either filing for bankruptcy or \nresolving his delinquent accounts. Several of the debts have low balances and could \nhave been gradually paid off over time. While circumstances beyond his control \ncontributed to his financial problems, he has not acted responsibly with regard to \nresolving his delinquent accounts.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) \ndoes not apply. While Applicant consulted a company to assist him in resolving his \ndebts after the hearing, he has not attended a financial counseling course. After the \n\n \n \n \n6\nhearing, he is reconsidering whether or not to file for bankruptcy but took no steps to file \nfor bankruptcy. It is unlikely his financial problems will be resolved in the near future.   \n \nAG & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the child support debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.w. Applicant has been regularly paying on his child support allegations and the \nbalance has been reduced from $37,858 to $22,355. However, he has not resolved any \nof the other delinquent accounts. AG \u00b6 20(d) only applies to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.w.  \n \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s financial situation remains a security concern. Applicant has \nnot mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s active duty \nservice in the U.S. Army. I considered his subsequent periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment. I considered Applicant\u2019s high monthly child support payments. I also \nconsidered if Applicant had planned better, his financial situation would have been more \nstable. While Applicant presented mitigating evidence, doubts remain. Mindful of my \nresponsibility to rule in favor of the national interest in cases where there is doubt, I find \nApplicant did not mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations and did not \nmeet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.v: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.x -1.aa: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on August 14, 2008 to request a security clearance required as part of his \nemployment with a defense contractor (Item 5). After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.1  \n \nOn January 19, 2010, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \n(Item 1) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 See Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nJuly 26, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nDirective under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG). \n \nApplicant received the SOR on April 5, 2010. He answered the SOR on April 13, \n2010, and requested a decision without a hearing. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted 14 allegations, and denied the remaining 14 allegations. DOHA Department \nCounsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM)2 in support of the government\u2019s \npreliminary decision to deny Applicant's request. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant \non May 7, 2010, and he received it on May 13, 2010. He was given 30 days from the \ndate he received the FORM to file a response. He did not respond. The case was \nassigned to me on July 20, 2010, for an administrative decision based on the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are incorporated as findings of \nfact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the \nFORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old. He married twice. The first marriage ended in divorce. \nHe separated from his second wife in 2008. He is the father of a teenaged son who \nresides with him. Applicant earned a technical certificate in 1993, and worked as an \naircraft technician for a large commercial airline from 2000 to 2005. He then obtained \nhis current job as a quality auditor in April 2005. (Items 5, 7) \n \n \nThe 28 SOR debts, which appear in Applicant's credit reports of August 2008 \nthrough October 2009, total $18,288. Several of the debts became delinquent in 2003 \nand 2004. Applicant denied half of the debts in the SOR. Other than one debt, he failed \nto explain the reasons for his denials. Regarding the one debt that he denied, he noted \nthat he consulted the company, but failed to provide any further details. In his response \nto DOHA interrogatories, he noted that he was \u201cworking to identify\u201d several creditors, \nand that he planned to try to pay the smaller debts until he could afford to set up \npayment plans for the larger debts. He has not made payments on any of the debts, \nincluding the 13 debts that are approximately $100 or less. (Items 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11) \n \n \nIn January 2005, Applicant was laid off from his job with a major airline, where \nhis annual salary was $75,000. He could have retained his position if he had moved to \nanother state. However, his wife was about to graduate from nursing school. He \ndecided to remain in his home state and accept a lower income, because his wife\u2019s \nsalary as a nurse would compensate for the loss in his income. From January to April \n2005, he was unemployed. He relied on his severance package and unemployment \ninsurance to support his family, which consisted of his wife, son, and his wife\u2019s two \n \n2 See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included 11 documents (Items 1 - 11) proffered \nin support of the Government\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nchildren.3 In April 2005, he obtained a position with his current employer, at an annual \nincome of $40,000. Applicant's wife handled the household finances. (Item 7) \n \n \nIn September 2005, Applicant's spouse was arrested on a charge of prescription \nfraud, and was placed on reduced pay pending the outcome of her case. She was found \nguilty in February 2006, and lost her job and her nursing license. One year later, she \nobtained a clerical job at a salary of $20,000. These events took a toll on Applicant's \nmarriage, and in May 2008, they separated. At that time, he was aware that they had \ndebts, but did not know the extent of their delinquencies. (Item 7) \n \n \nIn November 2008, at his security interview, Applicant stated that, once his \ndivorce was final, he was considering retaining assistance from a credit counseling \ncompany. At the time, Applicant had a monthly net income of $2,800 and expenses of \n$2,300, leaving him with a monthly net remainder of $500. In January 2009, he \nconsulted a credit counseling company. The financial statement developed by the \ncompany showed his net income was $2,500 and expenses of $2,800, leaving a \nmonthly shortfall of $300. Applicant did not implement the company\u2019s plan because he \ncould not afford the monthly payments. He submitted an updated personal financial \nstatement with his Answer. It shows income of $2,300, and expenses of $2,110 leaving \na monthly remainder of $190. (Items 4, 6, 7)  \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.4 Decisions \nmust also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly \nreferred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept. The presence or absence of a disqualifying \nor mitigating condition does not determine a conclusion for or against an applicant. \nHowever, specific applicable guidelines are followed when a case can be measured \nagainst them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access \nto classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by \nthe parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors \naddressed under Guideline F (financial considerations). \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \n \n3 Applicant provided conflicting information the number of children he supports. In his Answer, he noted \nthat he supported himself and two teenaged sons. However, in his April 2009 interrogatory response, he \nstated that he was providing support for \u201cmy teenage son, who will grad [sic] In 2010.\u201d \n \n4 Directive. 6.3. \n \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the Government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.  \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, \nthe Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the Government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may \nlead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that \ncannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe evidence contained in the FORM shows that Applicant started to have \ndelinquencies in 2003. He admits that he is unable to pay his debts. His seven-year \nhistory of failing to meet his financial obligations supports application of disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b619 (a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619 (c) (a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations). \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following conditions that can potentially mitigate security \nconcerns are relevant:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n7 See Egan; Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay his debts did not occur in the distant past, because the \ndebts are still delinquent. He has not shown that he is in a position where his debts are \nunlikely to recur. His unresolved financial situation casts doubt on his reliability, and AG \n\u00b6 20a cannot be applied. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is relevant because Applicant's wife committed prescription fraud \nand, as a result, the family was deprived of her income when she lost her nursing \nlicense and position. These are circumstances that Applicant could not have predicted. \nHowever, to be applicable, this mitigating condition requires that the person act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant acted responsibly when he took a step \ntoward debt resolution by contacting a consumer credit company. However, he failed to \nfollow through on the company\u2019s plan to resolve his debts, or to create and implement \nhis own plan. As a result, his debts remain unpaid with no plan in place to resolve them. \nAG \u00b6 20 (b) applies in part.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s initial contact with a consumer credit company implicates AG 20(c). \nHowever, it cannot be applied because Applicant has not set up a payment plan for any \nof his debts nor brought the problem under control. For the same reasons, mitigation is \nunavailable under AG \u00b6 20(d). The record shows no evidence that Applicant has paid \nany of the debts alleged in the SOR, including the 13 small debts that are less than $50. \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns about financial considerations.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited Guideline. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence  \n \nApplicant is 46 years old and presumed to be a mature, responsible adult. He accrued \nsignificant debt since 2003. In response to the government\u2019s concerns, he offered proof \nthat he has contacted a consumer credit company, which developed a plan to resolve \nhis debts. However, he could not afford to retain the company. Although half of the SOR \ndebts are approximately $100 or less, he has not paid any of them or initiated a plan to \ndo so.

Applicant has rebutted or \nmitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under financial considerations. Clearance \nis granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \n1 \nMarch 30, 2010\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on June 22, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial consideration. \n  \n \nOn July 10, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nAugust 5, 2009, I was assigned the case. On August 17, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing, which was held on September 22, 2009.  \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 7, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Ex. A through K, which \nwere admitted into evidence. On September 30, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admitted all the factual allegations, with \nexplanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. \nAfter a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old information technology (IT) technician who has worked \nfor various defense contractors over the past few years. He is currently unemployed and \nseeking to obtain a security clearance. If a clearance is obtained, a DoD contractor \nintends to hire him. Applicant received a U.S. Army certificate of appreciation for his \n\u201causpicious service\u201d as a DoD contractor in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. \n(Answer to SOR) In 2003, Applicant was out of the state and returned briefly in 2004. \n(Tr. 39)  \n \n \nIn 1996, when Applicant moved to a new state, he turned in his old vehicle \nlicense plates to his new state\u2019s Department of Transportation (DOT) when he received \nthat state\u2019s license plates. In 1999, his old state finally received the plates from his new \nstate\u2019s DOT. Applicant does not know why it took this long. However, because the \nplates were not immediately returned to his prior state, that state is demanding a $100 \nrestoration fee. (Tr. 49) \n \n \nFrom 1999 through 2006, Applicant experienced periods of unemployment. From \nDecember 1997 through October 1999, Applicant was employed, and from October \n1999 to September 2002, he was again employed, this time with an annual salary of \n$55,000. (Tr. 57) This job was terminated when the company decided to move the \noperation to another state. (Tr. 40) Applicant was out of work, living on unemployment \ncompensation, for a year before obtaining a job in Iraq in August 2003. (Tr. 51) That job \nlasted ten months. (Tr. 58) At the time, Applicant was married and his wife was working. \nDuring the marriage, his wife handled their finances and was responsible for sending \npayments on their debts. (Tr. 71) While out of the country, Applicant assumed his wife \nwas paying their joint debts in a timely manner, which was an error. (Tr. 16) \n \nIn 2004 or 2005, Applicant obtained another overseas job, this time working in \nKuwait. (Tr. 41, 51, 58) The job lasted four months and was followed by a four-month \n \n2 \n\njob in Iraq. (Tr. 59) Applicant returned to the United States for about eight months \nbefore obtaining his next job in September 2006. (Tr. 42, 59) In April 2006, Applicant \nand his wife of 18 years divorced. (Ex. 1, p. 5, Tr. 42) For eight months in 2006, \nApplicant was unemployed. From September 2006 until September 2007, Applicant was \nemployed in Iraq. (Tr. 52)  \n \n \nIn 2007, he obtained a job lasting seven months in the United States. (Tr. 43) In \nMarch 2008, Applicant completed training and was DoD certified in an area of IT. (Tr. \n42) In February 2008, he accepted a temporary out-of-state job. (Tr. 60) In May 2008, \nthe job terminated and he was unemployed until August or September 2008, when he \nobtained a job, which lasted until May 2009. (Tr. 53) When that job terminated, \nApplicant went on government assistance until a month before the hearing. He was on \nfood stamps for the last three months before they ran out, and he needs to reapply. (Tr. \n57) A month prior the hearing, he obtained a part-time job as a disk jockey (DJ), which \npays $100 a night when he works. (Tr. 44, 55) Applicant has a DoD contractor waiting to \nhire him if he obtains a security clearance. (Tr. 72)  \n \n \nIn December 2002, Applicant purchased a computer for $1,200. Applicant quit \nmaking monthly payments on the computer when he was unemployed and later forgot \nabout the debt. (Ex. 5) In 2003 or 2004, he began working with a credit counseling \nservice that negotiated with his creditors and established a repayment plan. In 2004, \nApplicant was unemployed for six or seven months. (Ex. 5) He was unable to make his \n$1,283 house payment for four months. In 2005, the house was sold and all obligations \nrelated to the house were paid. \n \n \nIn February 2009, Applicant retained a credit service to assist him with his debts. \n(Ex. 6, p. I-19, Tr. 36) The credit service contacted his creditors asking that they verify \ntheir accounts with Applicant. The credit service informed Applicant of his consumer \ncredit rights. Establishing credit, paying the smaller debts first, seeking to have the \ninterest rate lowered, and paying the creditors charging the highest interest rate first, \nwere also discussed. (Tr. 37)  \n \n \nIn September 2009, Applicant contacted a debt resolution company to establish a \ndebt management program. (Ex. J) The program required Applicant to make $138 \nmonthly payments, which included a $15 monthly service fee. (Ex. J) The plan would \naddress the $1,646 credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and the $3,972 credit card debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.i). (Ex. K) Once the creditors verify the debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($244), SOR \u00b6 1.e \n($389), and SOR \u00b6 1.j ($200), Applicant intends to include these accounts in his debt \nmanagement plan. (Tr. 39) \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife have two children. (Tr. 41) His oldest son, now 24 \nyears old, is in the Navy, and was shot while serving in Iraq in January 2008. (Tr. 54) \nHis son has recovered. His other son is a senior in high school preparing to go to \ncollege. (Tr. 54) His ex-wife is currently not working. Applicant\u2019s monthly budget lists \n$1,200 monthly child support payments, which he is not paying. (Ex. 6, p. I-16, Tr. 56) \n \n3 \n\nCurrently, he pays her $25 per month and owes her the remainder, which he intends to \npay when his finances permit it. (Tr. 57)  \n \n \nA summary of Applicant\u2019s judgment, accounts charged off, accounts placed for \ncollection, and other unpaid obligations and their current status follows: \n \nSOR Creditor \nAmount Current Status \na \nTelephone service \naccount in collection. \n$244 \nApplicant is disputing this debt. (Tr. 17) He \nbelieved he paid his last telephone bill. (Tr. \n62) He has asked the creditor for a detailed \nbilling summary. Once verified, Applicant \nintends to include this in his debt \nmanagement plan. (Tr. 39) \nb \nCredit card company \njudgement. Applicant \nand his now ex-wife \neach had a credit card.  \n$5,815 \n \nThis is his ex-wife\u2019s debt. (Tr. 45) Applicant \ndisputed this debt and creditor agreed to \nremove it from his CBR because Applicant \nwas only an authorized user on the card. \n(Ex. B, Tr. 26, 34)  \nc \nAccount placed for \ncollection. \n$404 \n \nUnpaid. Debt incurred for a urinalysis. If \nApplicant was hired the company would \npay this debt.

(Tr. 17) The \nstate where he previously lived is \ndemanding $100 restoration fee. (Tr. 49)  \nk \nComputer account \nplaced for collection. \n$2,387 \nApplicant offered to settle. Creditor stated it \nwould not open a closed account and had \nsent the account to a collection firm. (Ex. \nH) That firm has offered a settlement of \nthree monthly payments of $471. (Tr. 49, \n50)  \n \nTotal debt listed in SOR \n$15,392\n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n \n5 \n\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. The SOR reflects a judgment and ten past due obligations, which total \napproximately $15,500. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n6 \n\n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Nine SOR debts \nremain unpaid or unresolved, which makes them recent and numerous. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required \nto be debt-free or to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or \nsimultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given his \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \nDue to circumstances beyond his control, specifically four periods of \nunemployment, Applicant has been unable to make progress on paying his bills. The \nAppeal Board\u2019s discussion of AG & 20(b) in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. Bd. Oct. \n29, 2009) clarifies the applicability of this mitigating condition when an Applicant is \nunable to make substantial progress on delinquent debts after circumstances outside an \napplicant\u2019s control cause delinquent debt. The Appeal Board at 3 determined that \nadministrative judge erred when he failed to explain, \n \n. . . what he believes that Applicant could or should have done under the \ncircumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor financial \n \n7 \n\ncondition, or why the approach taken by Applicant was not \u201cresponsible\u201d in \nlight of his limited circumstances.  \n \nWhat constitutes sufficient responsible behavior to mitigate concerns depends on \nthe facts of a given case. In the circumstances at issue here, Applicant was unemployed \nfrom August 2002 to August 2003, for six months in 2004, eight months in 2006, for four \nmonths in 2008, and for five months in 2009. Just prior to the hearing, Applicant was \nliving on food stamps and government assistance. If he obtains his clearance, he has a \njob waiting for him with a DoD contractor. Additionally, in 2006 his marriage of 18 years \nended, with the financial burden that accompanies divorce including a child support \nobligation. These unexpected events were beyond his control. AG & 20(b) applies. \n \nApplicant has acted responsibly given his limited resources. The SOR lists 11 \npast due obligations totaling approximately $15,500. Applicant has paid one debt SOR \n& 1.g, $185) He has disputed two debts (SOR & 1.b, $5,815 and SOR & 1.h, $185), \ntotaling $6,000. He has been told the largest of the SOR debts, the $5,815 credit card \njudgment (SOR & 1.b), will be removed from his CBR since he was only an authorized \nuser on his wife\u2019s credit card. He has arranged a debt management plan for three debts \n(SOR & 1.d, $1,585, SOR & 1.f, $126, and SOR & 1.i, $3,972), which total \napproximately $5,700. Applicant is disputing two other debts (SOR & 1.a, $244 and \nSOR & 1.e, $389), which total $600. However, there is no final resolution as to his \ndisputes.  \n \nThree debts (SOR & 1.c, $404, SOR & 1.j, $200, and SOR & 1.k, $2,387), which \ntotal approximately $3,000 remain unpaid. Applicant financial situation prevents him \nfrom accepting the settlement offer on SOR & 1.k, $2,387.  \n \nAs previously stated, Applicant has three debts included in his debt management \nplan, which shows some a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. Applicant does not receive full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because this \narrangement was only recently made and there is no \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt \npayment. \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \n \n8 \n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations \nomitted).  \n \nApplicant has acted responsibly given his limited income. There is little else \nApplicant can currently do to rectify his poor financial condition. Applicant\u2019s approach is \nresponsible in light of his limited resources. Neither the remaining $3,000 of unpaid \ndebt, nor his only recent enrollment in a debt management plan raises concerns about \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nThe whole person factors against granting Applicant a clearance are significant; \nhowever, they do not warrant revocation of his security clearance. Applicant\u2019s failure to \npay or resolve his just debts in accordance with contracts he signed was not prudent or \nresponsible. He has a history of financial problems. However, the debts incurred were \nnot the type that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide \nby rules and regulations. Additionally, his financial difficulties were increased because \nhe was working overseas and relied upon his then wife to pay their debts in a timely \nmanner with the money he was sending her.  \n \n9 \n\n \n10 \n \nThe rationale for granting Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial. He was \nforthright and candid in his security clearance application, his responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories, his responses to an OPM investigator, his SOR response, and in his \ntestimony at his hearing about his financial problems. Several problems beyond his \ncontrol adversely affected his financial status. In the past eight years, he has had four \nperiods of unemployment and his 18-year marriage ended in divorce. He has arranged \nto start payment plans on three of the debts. I am confident he will keep his promise to \npay his delinquent debts.  \n \nApplicant deserves substantial credit for his service in Southwest Asia at various \ntimes from 2003 through 2007. He has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism, and \ntrustworthiness through his service to the DoD as a contractor. He has served in the \ncombat zone of Iraq risking his life to support DoD missions in that country. His son was \nwounded in the service of his country. There is simply no reason not to trust this \npatriotic American with our nation\u2019s secrets. \n \nApplicant is 43 years old. He has demonstrated self-discipline, responsibility and \ndedication. His financial problems were caused by his unemployment, and family \nproblems, rather than by his misconduct or irresponsible spending. Applicant is an \nintelligent person, and he understands his need to be financially responsible.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20141.k:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Roberson, Jr., Personal Representative \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nE, Personal Conduct and Guideline F, Financial Considerations. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance is denied. \n \nOn March 15, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F and Guideline E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 29, 2010, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 11, 2010. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 19, 2010. I convened the hearing as \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 25, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nscheduled on June 8, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 14. \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits \n(AE) A through I, which were admitted without objection. Applicant also offered a \n\u201cMemorandum in Support\u201d which was marked as Hearing Exhibit I. The record was held \nopen until June 15, 2010, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents, which he \ndid, and they were marked as AE J through N. The Government provided a written \nresponse, which was marking as Hearing Exhibit II. He had no objections to the exhibits \nand the documents were admitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June \n15, 2010.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nThe Government amended the SOR adding \u00b6 1.e stating: \u201cYou failed to file your \nfederal income tax returns for 2006 through 2009 and your state income tax returns for \n2008 and 2009.\u201d Applicant did not object and the motion was granted. Applicant was \nafforded an opportunity to continue the hearing to permit him proper notice and \nopportunity to prepare his response. He elected to proceed with the hearing.1 \nDepartment Counsel submitted copies of relevant state statutes. I have marked them as \nHearing Exhibit III and taken administrative notice of them.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d and denied the \nremaining allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 63 years old. He is married and has four grown children. He has \nbeen divorced three times. He has been married to his current wife since 1996.2 She is \na nurse and works on a military installation. He served in the Air Force from 1964 to \n1968. Applicant graduated from college with an engineering degree. He also has earned \na master\u2019s degree. He had a security clearance when he was on active duty and again \nwas granted a Secret clearance some time around 1990.3  \n \n \nApplicant completed his latest security clearance application (SCA) on December \n12, 2006, and swore to its accuracy. In it he disclosed he lived in State A from \nDecember 1999 to the present and listed a local address. While living in State A he \nworked for the same company from December 1999 to the present. He disclosed he \n \n1 Tr. 110-113, 150-153. \n \n2 Applicant testified he was married four times. He only lists one marriage ending in divorce on his \nsecurity clearance application dated December 12, 2006. He does not list that he is currently married. In \naddition, he only lists one daughter and none of his three other children.  \n \n3 Tr. 12, 27-35, 58, 139-143. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nlived from January 1996 to December 1999, at two different residences, in State B. He \nworked for the same company in State B, from January 1996 until December 1999.4 \n \n \nApplicant indicated in his response to SCA Question 27(c) that he had a lien \nplaced against his property for failing to pay taxes and other debts. In the comment \nsection he wrote: \n \nPending case and previous cases against the fraud of the IRS. Private \ninvestigation revealed that this private agency was unconstitutionally given \ncontrol of tax collection and assessment through a shady deal over the \nChristmas holiday period in 1913-1914 time era. Those who [challenge] \nthe constitutionality of this act have tax liens placed on their property. \nCase histories are contained in my file. Current cases are: U.S. Tax Court, \nWashington D.C. Docket Number [xxxx-05 and xxxxx-04].5  \n \n \nApplicant lost his tax cases and his wages were garnished. Applicant provided a \ndocument from the IRS dated May 25, 2004, showing a release of levy against his \nwages.6  \n \n \nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (NSP) on \nMay 1, 1996, and swore to its accuracy.7 He disclosed that he lived and worked in State \nC from April 1989 to August 1990 and April 1993 to April 1996. He disclosed in the \nquestionnaire that he lived in State D from August 1990 to April 1993, and that he lived \nand worked in State B from April 1996 to present, which was May 1, 1996. At his \nhearing, Applicant stated he left State C and moved to State B around 1996. He then \nstated: \u201c[I] moved to [State A] in, I think it was like 2000, 1999, or 2000.\u201d8 \n \n \nAs part of his answer to the SOR, Applicant provided an affidavit and swore to its \naccuracy. In the affidavit he stated he lived in State D prior to 1988. He moved to State \nC in the mid-summer of 1988 and became a resident of State C. He surrendered his \ndriver\u2019s license from State D and obtained a driver\u2019s license from State C. He returned \nto State D in February 1989 and packed his belongings and had his mail forwarded. He \nstated: \u201cFrom that point forward, I never lived or worked in [State D]. From early \nFebruary 1989 to the present, I ceased having any and all nexus with [State D].\u201d At his \nhearing Applicant stated he moved to State C in the beginning of 1989 and became a \nresident. He obtained a driver\u2019s license, a business license, and registered to vote in \n \n4 GE 1. \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 Tr. 90-91. \n \n7 GE 2.  \n \n8 Tr. 36, 60-61. In GE 2 above the date \u201c8/90\u201don the application there is a small question mark next to the \nmonth.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nState C.9 He further stated that from 1990 to 1993 he worked in State D on occasion. \nHe would periodically go to State D for jobs, but was working under contracts from \nemployers located in State C, where he lived. He stated State D was not his residence \nwhen he listed it in GE 2, but rather this was where he lived when he visited State D. He \nestimated he visited State D four or five times a year for approximately one week each \ntime. In a statement provided on September 6, 1996, Applicant stated: \u201cIn February 92, I \nlost my job with the [Y] laboratory due to cut back[s] in the project I was involved with. \nFrom Feb 92 until April 96, I worked as a self employed software engineer in [State \nC].\u201d10 Applicant listed on his NSP questionnaire that [Y] laboratory was located in State \nD and he worked there from August 1990 until April 1993.11 Applicant\u2019s sworn \nstatements and testimony are inconsistent. Applicant\u2019s testimony that he had no contact \nwith State D after 1988 is not credible.12  \n \n \nApplicant is indebted to State D for tax liens entered against him in 1998 and \n1994, in the approximate amounts of $8,012 and $6,491, respectively. Applicant \ndisputes he owes these debts because he claims he did not live in State D. Applicant \ndid not provide evidence to show he has formally disputed the liens with State D, has \nresolved them, or they have been released. He provided a copy of a certified letter he \nsent to State D claiming the liens do not belong to him because he did not live in State \nD in 1991, 1992 or 1993.13 He stated in the letter the following:  \n \n \nI moved out of [State D] in the 1st quarter of the year 1989 and became a \nresident of another state. I called the telephone number xxx-xxx-xxxx in \nyour \u201cnotice\u201d and received a phone announcement that the number was \ndisconnected or not in service. I contacted my attorney and my \naccountant. They both advised me of scams by Israeli scam artists posing \nas Nigerians trying to steal money from U.S.A. citizens with various tax \nand inherited money scams. I understand that THE STATE OF [D] is \nfinancially bankrupt and is desperate in trying to raise funds. Please, move \non to someone else who really owes you money and stop this shakedown \nprocess. Please update your records to reflect that I am not responsible \nfor this debt and that I am not a resident of THE STATE OF [D].  \n \n \nP.S. Some questions which should be answered in order for [State D] to \nrecover and survive the coming crisis. When is THE STATE OF [D] going \nto return the land stolen from Indian [People]. When is THE STATE OF [D] \ngoing to compensate the Indian Peoples for the years they were denied \naccess to all of their land? The Indian Peoples (sic) may accept the \n \n9 AE B, C. \n \n10 GE 6 at 1. \n \n11 GE 2. \n \n12 Tr. 28, 61-79, 113-122. \n \n13 Tr. 45-57; AE I. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n\u201cimprovements\u201d and return of their land as compensation for the years of \ndenial of access to their land. Only God knows. \n \n \nMy understanding is that God does not like lying, stealing, and cheating \nmurderers. That the One God is patient and does allow people free will, \nbut God is also JUST and destroys those who are unjust. A word to the \nwise is sufficient to get them onto the correct path.14 \n \n \nIn a statement made to a Government investigator on September 6, 1996, \nApplicant stated the following:  \n \nState Tax Lien from [county] Recorder Office in Oct 94 for $6,400. I was \nunaware of any [State D] tax lien against me. I do not recall that [State D] \nclaimed I owed taxes the details of which I do not recall. I thought that it \nhad all had been paid. (sic) I was told that [State D] requires a release and \na copy of my driver\u2019s license to check [State C] state tax records.15  \n \nIt is unclear if this is one of the tax liens alleged or a different one. In any event, it \nis clear that Applicant was aware there was a tax issue from State D that was \nunresolved. Applicant\u2019s position is he was unaware until 2009 that there were existing \ntax liens against him from State D. Applicant\u2019s 2006 SCA and 1996 NSP questionnaire \nlist the dates he lived in State D and is consistent with State D\u2019s tax liens. Applicant did \nnot provide evidence that he has resolved the tax liens.16  \n \n \nApplicant provided copies of two checks issued from State D to Applicant. In \n2007, he discovered an unclaimed property fund in State D. He learned his name was \nlisted and he submitted a claim. He then received the two checks. It appears the \namounts are distributions from investment funds. The dates of the checks are June 19, \n2007 and August 8, 2007. Applicant\u2019s position was that he would not have received \nthese checks if he owed State D money. No evidence was provided to show that the \nfund that issued the checks was aware that State D\u2019s tax board had a lien against \nApplicant. Applicant did not provide evidence to show what the appropriate rules are for \nthe tax board to confiscate the checks.17  \n \n \nApplicant moved to State A in December 1999 as is reflected in his SCA.18 His \ntestimony is that he has been living in State A since 2000. He never obtained a driver\u2019s \nlicense from State A, as is required. He is required to file state income taxes in State A \n \n14 Id. \n \n15 GE 6 at 4. \n \n16 Tr. 47-57, 94-107. \n \n17 Tr. 47; AE E, F. \n \n18 GE 1. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nbecause of his continued presence in the state more than 183 days.19 He stated he is in \nState A temporarily. He has lived in State A temporarily for the past 10 years. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony is not believable. Applicant claims he continues to be a resident of \nState C and travels there about three days a year. State C does not have a state \nincome tax. He maintains a driver\u2019s license in State C. He is registered to vote in State \nC, and voted by mail in State C\u2019s local election in the past year. When he purchased a \ncar, State A required him to register it in the state. The residential address he provided \nto his employer is located in State A. He registers two other vehicles in State C.20   \n \n \nState A required Applicant to file state income returns due to his presence in the \nstate, and his employment in the state. He did not file his 1999 to 2005 state tax returns \non time. He did not file his state income tax returns for 2006 to 2009. Applicant \ncontested in court that he owed State A income taxes. He lost the case and State A \ngarnished his wages. Applicant did not provide evidence that he filed his 2006 to 2009 \nstate income tax returns. Applicant provided a \u201cNotification of Overpayment\u201d letter from \nState A for tax year 2001 in the amount of $1,223.38. In addition, he provided a letters \nshowing that $96 in interest was owed to him for tax year 2001. These documents show \nhe was due a refund in 2001. He did not provide evidence that his State A tax liens \nhave been released.21  \n \n \nIn May 2006, Applicant contacted a Certified Public Accounting firm (CPA) for tax \nand financial advice. He stated: \u201cafter I had the consultation with [CPA firm], they \nsuggested that I, you know, start paying, paying taxes.\u201d22 They recommended that he \nfile the open year\u2019s tax returns (2006) in the future. The CPA firm assisted in the \npreparation of Federal and State A income tax return filings for 2000 through 2005. At \nthat time no federal or state income taxes were being withheld from Applicant\u2019s \npaycheck. The CPA firm recommended that Applicant have the current year\u2019s income \ntaxes withheld from his paycheck, and that he should implement a budget, if he did not \nalready have one. The CPA firm was made aware that Applicant\u2019s wages were being \ngarnished for prior tax obligations, but they were not involved in that process.23  \n \n \nThe CPA firm did not advise Applicant or assist him in preparing his income tax \nreturns for 2006, 2007, or 2008. In 2009, Applicant contacted the CPA firm regarding a \ntax claim from State D. The firm advised him to handle the matter himself, because their \ninvolvement would be cost prohibitive. The CPA firm noted it was their understanding \nthe matter was resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. No evidence was provided to support that \nposition. The CPA firm also noted that it is not uncommon when a taxpayer moves from \n \n19 HE III. \n \n20 Tr. 37, 79-84, 122-123, 131-132. \n \n21 Tr. 36-38, 43-45; AE L, M. \n \n22 Tr. 85-86. \n \n23 Tr. 42, 84-89; AE G. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \none state to another that the former state of residence issues a tax bill. There is \nadditional confusion if the new state does not have an income tax, which is a way to \nprove there is a new state of residence.24  \n \n \nApplicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns from 2004 to 2009. His \nwages were garnished in the amount of approximately $40,000. When asked if he filed \nhis federal income tax returns for 2006 to 2009, he stated \u201cI just let them take the \nmaximum out of my paycheck.\u201d25 Applicant admitted he did not fill out and file the \nappropriate tax return forms.26 Applicant claims he is having income tax withheld from \nhis paycheck. He did not provide any evidence of the amount of federal or state income \ntax withheld from his paycheck.  \n \n \nApplicant provided a statement to an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement on June 30, 2009. He stated:  \n \n \nBoth the [f]ederal and [State A] tax liens have been satisfied and I have \nnot had any other past or current tax issues. I now have an \naccountant/attorney [Mr. X of State Y] handling the filing of my taxes to \nhelp avoid any issues or problems in the future. The only people that know \nabout these issues are those involved to include my accountant.27  \n \n* * * \n \n \nAs an added note about my tax lien issues, I was not attempting to be \ndishonest or otherwise avoid paying taxes on these issues. I had let the \nIRS file for me in years prior to this issue. They usually withheld enough \nmoney and allowed them to calculate what I owed and charge me \naccordingly. I am not sure what happened on these two federal liens and \ncan only guess they did not know my correct salary or bonuses I received \nand did not withhold enough during the year.28  \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement contradicts information provided in the affidavit by the CPA firm \nand his testimony. The CPA firm stated they did not file Applicant\u2019s federal or state \nincome tax returns beyond 2005. They advised him to file his tax returns in 2006. \nApplicant admitted at his hearing he had not filed his 2006 through 2009 state tax \nreturns.29 \n \n24 Id. \n \n25 Tr. 87. \n \n26 Tr. 87-90. \n \n27 GE 5 at 3. \n \n28 Id. \n \n29 Tr. 87-90. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nApplicant stated at his hearing that he was unaware that he was required to file \nfederal tax return forms through the IRS Collection Agency.30 This statement contradicts \nhis statement of June 30, 2009. He also provided a statement in September 6, 1996. In \nit he stated:  \n \n \nDuring 1994/1995 time period, the IRS claimed that I owed $18,000 or \n$20,000 in taxes. I did not have much income coming in so [the] IRS took \nthe money owed from stocks I that I owned. (sic) To my knowledge the \nIRS received the money they required. I have been current with the filing \nof my taxes. However I did not file for tax years 1993, 1994, and 1995. I \nwas not required to file because I did not make enough money for those \nyears to file.31 \n \n \nApplicant was aware as far back as at least 1994, when he made the above \nstatement, of his duty to file his income tax returns. Applicant\u2019s position was that he \nunderstood he had to pay taxes, but did not know he had to file his income tax returns. \nHe stated he believed the government could take the maximum money from his pay to \nsatisfy his taxes and because he did not care about receiving a refund, he did not have \nto file a form. He believed filing the form was a formality. I find Applicant was not \ncredible.32 \n \n \nI find Applicant\u2019s testimony throughout the hearing was untruthful, intentionally \nmisleading, and he repeatedly provided false testimony. I have considered all of the \ndocuments provided to me by Applicant.33  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are must be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n \n \n30 Tr. 90-93. Applicant protests the constitutionality of the IRS and Federal Reserve. Those matters are \nnot pertinent to the issues raised in this hearing and will not be addressed.  \n \n31 Tr. 124-131. GE 6 at 3. Applicant confirmed the signature on the document belonged to him, but could \nnot recall aspects of his statement.  \n \n32 Tr.134-141, 153-154. \n \n33 AE A-N. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n10 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same. \n \nApplicant has a long history of failing to file his federal and state income tax \nreturns. He did not file his federal tax returns in 2004 and 2005 and his wages were \ngarnished. He again failed to file his 2006 through 2009 federal tax returns. He failed to \nfile his state income tax returns from 1999 to 2007 and his wages were garnished. He \nagain failed to file his state income tax returns from 2008 to 2009. Applicant incurred tax \nobligations while living in State D that he has not paid. Tax liens were entered against \nhim by State D. I find there is sufficient evidence to raise all of the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n\n \n11 \n \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nI find none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has intentionally and \ndeliberately failed to file his federal and state income tax returns. He has contested the \nlegitimacy of the IRS and other tax issues in federal and state court and lost. In 2006, \nhis CPA firm assisted him in filing his 2000 to 2005 federal and state income tax returns. \nHe was advised by the CPA firm that he should file his 2006 federal and state income \ntax returns and he did not. He admitted he did not file his 2006 through 2009 federal \nincome tax returns. He admitted he did not file his 1999 through 2009 state income tax \nreturns. It appears that sometime around 2006 or 2007 he began to have taxes withheld \nfrom his income, but claims he did not know he had to actually file the tax forms. He did \nnot provide sufficient evidence regarding taxes being withheld from his income. Based \non all of the evidence, I find Applicant was well aware of his obligation to file his federal \nand state income tax return forms and did not.  \n \n \nApplicant has been living in State A since 1999 or 2000, and has not willingly \npaid his taxes. State A has had to garnish his wages. Applicant failed to change his \nstate of residence to State A after living there for the requisite time period, as is required \nby law. He continues to owe State D taxes. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to \nprovide evidence that he filed the federal and state income tax returns in question, and \nhe did not. Applicant\u2019s intentional actions cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. His repeated conduct raises serious doubts about his ability to follow \nrules. None of the circumstances that were raised were beyond his control. Factually, \nhe created all of the issues by his repeated actions. Paying past taxes through \ngarnishment is not a good-faith effort to resolve his problems. There are not clear \nindications the problem is resolved because Applicant continues to fail to file his income \ntax returns. His disputes were resolved against him in court.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG & 15:   \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answered during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 16 and especially considered the following: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress such as \n\n \n12 \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which , if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nApplicant has a long history of failing to file his income tax returns, both federal \nand state. He claimed residency in a state he had not lived in for over ten years, \npresumably to avoid paying state income taxes in the state where he lives. His actions \nforced State A, where he was living, to garnish his wages to pay his tax liability. His \nfailure to file his federal income tax returns forced the federal government to garnish his \nwages to pay his tax liability. He did not provide proof that he has filed his 2006 through \n2009 federal income tax returns. He did not provide proof he has filed his 2006 through \n2009 state income tax returns. His conduct was deliberate and intentional. I find \nApplicant\u2019s actions reflect questionable judgment and untrustworthy behavior. I find his \npersonal conduct creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nbecause it may affect his personal, professional and community standing. Therefore, \nthe above disqualifying condition applies.  \n \n \nI have considered the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17. I find three potentially \napplicable. They are:  \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s repeated and intentional disregard for filing his federal and state \nincome tax returns is not minor. His deliberate actions and failure to show he is current \nin filing his taxes cast serious doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. He has not acknowledged or corrected the behavior. To the contrary, his \nbehavior is a continuing course of conduct that has not ceased. The conduct is likely to \nrecur and he has not taken steps to reduce his vulnerability. Applicant\u2019s testimony was \nunbelievable. He is aware of his obligation to file and pay his taxes. Instead, he chooses \nto force the federal and state government to garnish his wages or levy a tax lien against \nhim. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n13 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served his country in the \nAir Force. He has worked for a federal contractor for many years and held a security \nclearance. Applicant is well aware of his responsibility to file and pay federal and state \nincome taxes. He has consistently and intentionally neglected his legal responsibility. \nHis response that he was unaware that he actually had to file a form was disingenuous \nand his testimony lacked candor. His CPA firm provided an affidavit that they assisted \nhim in filing his 2000 through 2005 Federal and state income tax returns and advised \nhim to file his 2006 returns. He did not resolve State D\u2019s tax liens. His actions show that \nhe is unwilling to follow rules. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with serious \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the guidelines for Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph   2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n14 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 1, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.  \n \nMay 25, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 20, 2010. He requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 18, 2011. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 24, 2011, with a hearing date of February \n17, 2011. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted into evidence without objection. Department \nCounsel\u2019s exhibit index was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified, and \noffered one exhibit (AE) A. It was admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 25, 2011.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied all the Guideline D allegations (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e), but admitted all the Guideline E allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.e). After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 68 years old. He has been married for 41 years. He has two adult \nchildren. He retired from working for a defense contractor in January 2011. He is \nseeking his security clearance to continue working for the same defense contractor as a \nconsultant. He works as a systems engineer. He is a high school graduate with some \ncollege credits. He has no military service. He does not currently hold a security \nclearance.1   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct raised in the SOR includes: (1) purchasing a pornographic \nmagazine depicting teenagers in 1991 engaged in sexual acts or nudity; searching the \ninternet for child pornography once a week from 1995 until 2000; storing pictures of \nchild pornography on his computer\u2019s hard drive from 1995 until 2000; searching the \ninternet for nudist colonies and downloading pictures of naked children as young as two \nyears old, receiving emails with pictures of child pornography for about 10 years through \nJuly 2003 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.e); (2) being denied access to sensitive compartmented \ninformation (SCI) by a government agency in 2003; having his access to SCI and \neligibility for a top secret clearance revoked by a government agency in 2005; his wife\u2019s \nlack of knowledge of his denial of and revocation of SCI access and top secret eligibility, \nand the reasons for such denial or revocation. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.e) \n \n \n \nIn January 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a government agency in \nconnection with his security clearance access. During that interview, he admitted to \npurchasing a pornographic magazine at a sex shop in 1991 while in Germany. He \nfurther stated that the magazine depicted teenagers from ages 13-18 engaged in sex \nacts or posing nude. Applicant later stated that the magazine was purchased in the \nNetherlands. He also stated that he recently (before January 2003) used his home \ncomputer to search for nudist colonies on the internet. From this search he downloaded \napproximately 24-36 images of naked nudists, including some pictures of children as \nyoung as two years old. He disputed the characterization of his internet nudist colonies \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 6, 7, 36, 38-39; GE 1. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nsearch. He stated that he was searching for beach resorts and a \u201cpop up\u201d link directed \nhim to the nudist colony site.2 \n \n \nApplicant was re-interviewed by the same government agency in August 2003. \nDuring this interview, the term child pornography was defined and explained to him. \nWith this in mind, he disclosed to the interviewer that between 1995 and 2000, he used \nhis computer and the internet to view child pornography on a weekly basis. He would \nseek out these pictures by visiting \u201cnews group sites\u201d. The particular news group sites \nthat he sought out shared various types of pornography including child pornography. He \ncollected and stored child pornography pictures on his computer\u2019s hard drive. He \nstopped collecting these pictures and removed them from his computer in 2000 \nbecause he was concerned about child pornography laws. He also stated that he still \nwas receiving child pornography one or two times a month through emails. He has \nreceived these emails for ten years, the last one was in July 2003. The last one included \nan image of a boy and girl approximately six to seven years old, posed in a sexually \nexplicit fashion.3 \n \n \nApplicant, through his answer to the SOR and his testimony at hearing, denies \nhis intentional involvement with child pornography. He also asserts that the narrative \nsummaries of his two interviews by the government agency were inaccurate.4  \n \n \nBased upon the information provided by the Applicant during his two interviews in \nJanuary and August 2003, as discussed above, a government agency denied him \naccess to SCI in September 2003. Another government agency revoked his access to \nSCI and his top secret eligibility in April 2005. Applicant\u2019s wife is unaware of the denial \nor revocation actions or the reason for those actions.5   \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n                                                          \n2 GE 2 at I-31, I-32, I-33.  \n \n3 GE 2 at I-35, I-37, I-39. \n \n4 Tr. at 29-30; GE 2 at I-36, I-38, GE 4. \n \n5 Tr. at 40; GE 3. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nI have considered all of the Sexual Behavior disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n13 and especially considered the following: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and, \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \nApplicant admitted to viewing child pornography over an extended period of time \n(1995-2000) and storing images on his computer\u2019s hard drive. He received emails \nthrough 2003 that contained links to child pornographic images. In 2002, he conducted \ninternet searches that led him to child pornographic sites. He also bought a magazine in \n1991 containing nude images of teenagers. After his interviews with a government \nagency, he essentially recanted his earlier admissions and claimed that the reports \nmemorializing his interviews were not accurate. After reviewing the reports and \nconsidering the detailed facts that are referred to in those reports and the \ncontemporaneous nature of the interviews, I conclude that they accurately reflect \nApplicant\u2019s admissions at the time and are more persuasive then Applicant\u2019s after-the-\nfact minimizations and retractions. Possessing or viewing child pornography is a \ncriminal offense. Child pornography, possession or viewing, by its very nature, causes \nthe possessor to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. It is especially true \nhere where Applicant has never revealed his actions to his wife of 41 years. Any activity \ninvolving possessing or viewing child pornography reflects a lack of judgment.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n13(a), 13(c), and 13(d) all apply. \nI have considered all of the Sexual Behavior mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 \nand especially considered:  \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and,  \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s last admitted use of child pornography was in 2003, the \nnumber of times he possessed and viewed this material over an extended period of time \n(1995-2003) does not support the conclusion that the behavior is unlikely to recur. \nMoreover, his actions cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nBecause his wife remains unaware of his involvement with child pornography, his \nbehavior serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and (c) do \nnot apply. Since viewing or possessing child pornography is a crime itself regardless if it \nis done privately and discretely, the applicability of AG \u00b6 14(d) is irrelevant. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group.  \nAlthough the Guideline E allegations, \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.c, are framed in terms of \nApplicant\u2019s denial or revocation of his SCI access and top secret eligibility by \ngovernment agencies in 2003 and 2005, the underlying factual basis for each allegation \nis Applicant\u2019s involvement with child pornography. Therefore, the previous analysis \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d) also applies here. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s conduct \nof viewing child pornography over an eight year time-frame created a vulnerability to his \npersonal standing. This vulnerability was compounded by Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose \nhis child pornographic involvement and his reasons for such involvement to his wife. AG \n\u00b6 16(e) applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and especially considered the following: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n7 \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n \nViewing or possessing child pornography is a federal criminal offense and \ntherefore not minor. Applicant\u2019s actions were not infrequent and are not unlikely to \nrecur. They also cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant did not acknowledge his behavior; rather he minimized his actions after his \ninitial disclosures. No evidence was produced by Applicant regarding the reasons he \nengaged in obtaining child pornography. Applicant\u2019s decision not to inform his wife of his \ninvolvement with child pornography continues to make him vulnerable to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. Applicant questioned the reliability of the government agency\u2019s \nsummarized interviews; however, the information contained in those interviews was \ndetailed and contemporaneous. It was reliable and persuasive. None of the above \nmitigating factors apply here.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s service to \nhis company. I also considered the seriousness of his child pornography activity. \nApplicant\u2019s actions were violations of federal law. Based upon the number of admitted \nchild pornographic events, I conclude Applicant engaged in this activity on a regular \nbasis. Applicant did not meet his burden to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline D, \nSexual Behavior, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant:  Sheldon I. Cohen, Esquire \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under the Foreign  \nInfluence adjudicative guideline.  His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n                           Procedural and Preliminary Matters \n \nOn September 21, 2005, Applicant signed and certified a security clearance \napplication (SF-86). On May 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nNovember 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn June 4, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before a \nDOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 3, 2009. I \nconvened a hearing on August 31, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. At the \ncommencement of the hearing, Applicant offered a memorandum of law discussing \nDOHA security clearance decisions issued to U.S. citizens with former Iranian \nnationality and family contacts with citizens or residents of Iran. This document was \nidentified as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Department Counsel\u2019s answer to the Applicant\u2019s \nmemorandum of law was identified as HE II.  \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced two exhibits (Ex. 1 and Ex. \n2), which were admitted without objection. The Government offered for administrative \nnotice a summary memorandum containing facts about Iran found in 16 official U.S. \nGovernment documents. The Government also provided for administrative notice the 16 \nsource documents from which the facts in the summary memorandum were derived. I \nfailed to mark the Government\u2019s administrative notice documents at the hearing; \nhowever, I mark them now as HE III.  \n \n Applicant did not object to my taking notice of the summary memorandum, but \nhe did object to my taking notice of any facts in the 16 source documents that were not \ncontained in the summary memorandum. After discussion with Applicant, I overruled the \nobjection. \n \nApplicant testified on this own behalf and called four witnesses. At the hearing, \nhe introduced 11 exhibits, which were identified as Ex. A through Ex. K and admitted \nwithout objection. During the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that his wife and two \nchildren acquired Iranian passports for travel to Iran with him in 2004. He also \nacknowledged that his wife and children still possessed the Iranian passports, which he \nbelieved were valid. I left the record open until close of business September 10, 2009, \nso that Applicant could clarify the status of his family members\u2019 Iranian passports. \nSubsequently, Applicant timely filed an affidavit stating that on September 1, 2009, he   \nshredded and destroyed the Iranian passports of his wife, daughter, and son. Applicant \nalso provided photocopies of identifying photographs and information in the destroyed \npassports belonging to his wife, daughter, and son. Applicant\u2019s attorney provided a \nstatement that he had witnessed Applicant\u2019s destruction of the three Iranian passports. I \nidentified Applicant\u2019s affidavit and accompanying documents as Ex. L. Department \nCounsel did not object to the admission of Applicant\u2019s Ex. L. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) of the hearing on September 9, 2009. \n \n \n \n                                                    \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG B, Foreign \nInfluence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two \nallegations and denied one allegation. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted herein as \nfindings of fact.   \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record in the case, including witness testimony, \nexhibits, relevant policies, and the applicable adjudicative guideline, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old and employed as lead software engineer by a \ngovernment contractor. He has been married twice. He married for the first time in 1983. \nHe and his first wife divorced in 1986. In 1987, he married his current wife, who was \nborn in Burma and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Applicant and his wife are the parents of \ntwo children: a 21-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son. Applicant has not \npreviously held a security clearance. (Ex. 1; Tr. 76-77, 96-98.)  \n \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Iran. He came to the United States in 1978, at \nthe age of 19, to pursue higher education. In 1983, he earned a Bachelor of Science \ndegree in electrical engineering. In 1997, he earned a Master of Science degree in \ncomputer science. He earned both degrees at U.S. institutions. (Ex. 1; Tr. 103.) \n  \n \nWhen Applicant came to the United States to study, he expected to return to Iran \nto live and work. However, in 1979, the Iranian Revolution occurred. Applicant\u2019s father \nadvised him to remain in the United States because it was not safe for him to return to \nIran. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in July 1996. (Ex. 1; Tr. 104-105.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family suffered persecution under the regime established after the \n1979 revolution. One of Applicant\u2019s brothers was executed by the Iranian regime in \n1982, leaving behind a wife and a two-year-old child. After his death, it was determined \nthat he was not guilty of the crime for which he was executed. One of Applicant\u2019s sisters \nand her husband, a physician, were imprisoned for three years because of their alleged \nconnections with the brother who was executed. Another of Applicant\u2019s brothers was \nimprisoned for 1\u00bd years on the false charge that he had stolen a motorcycle. \nAdditionally, the regime concluded that Applicant was a political activist and would not \nallow his father to exchange money and send it to him for his education in the United \nStates. (Tr. 105-108, 111-119.) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are no longer living. His mother died in 2005 at the age of 83; \nhis father died in May 2008 at the age of 87. Applicant has two brothers and four sisters \nwho are citizens and residents of Iran. His siblings range in age from 44 to 64. One of \nhis brothers sells insurance; the other brother operates a grocery store. Applicant has \nhad e-mail contact with the teen-aged son of one of his brothers. His four sisters are \nhomemakers: one is married to a carpet salesman; one is married to a physician; and \ntwo are married to retired teachers. Among them, Applicant\u2019s sisters have 16 children. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant has had e-mail contact with the daughter of one of his sisters.  (Ex. 2, 5-9; Ex. \nA; Ex. B; Tr. 109-112, 137.) \n \n \nIn an interview with an authorized investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in October 2007, Applicant reported that one of his nephews \nworked for the Iranian government. The nephew\u2019s government employment was alleged \nat SOR \u00b6 1.c. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed he lacked sufficient \ninformation about the nephew\u2019s employment and could neither affirm nor deny the \nallegation. He therefore denied the allegation. At his hearing, Applicant explained that in \nabout 2002, his mother told him about the nephew\u2019s government employment. He did \nnot know if the nephew was currently working for the government of Iran, and he didn\u2019t \nknow what kind of work the nephew did. He had no contact with the nephew who \nreportedly worked for the Iranian government. (Tr. 112-113, 147.) \n \n  \nAdditionally, in his October 2007 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant \nreported that he spoke with each of his brothers by telephone approximately every three \nmonths. He also reported that he spoke with one of his sisters by telephone once a \nyear. His contact with his other three sisters was limited to visits with them when he \ntraveled to Iran to visit family. He also reported telephone contact with a nephew, the \nson of one of his sisters, every three months. The nephew is a travel agent. (Ex. 2 at 5-\n6.) \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant stated that his 2007 statements about the frequency of \nhis contact with his siblings and their children were no longer accurate. He stated that \nhe no longer communicated with his brothers and his nephew every three months. He \nalso stated he no longer spoke with one of his sisters yearly. He stated that his \ncommunications with his siblings had lessened after his father\u2019s death in 2008. In \nresponse to questions from his counsel, he was unable to recall how many specific \ncontacts he had with his siblings and their children. In response to cross examination, \nhe estimated that he had approximately ten telephone and e-mail contacts with his \nfamily members in Iran since his father\u2019s death in May 2008. (Tr. 131-137, 144.)   \n \n \nAfter receiving U.S. citizenship in 1996, Applicant maintained dual citizenship \nwith Iran. In an interview in March 2007, with an OPM investigator, he stated his \nwillingness to relinquish his Iranian citizenship. Applicant traveled to Iran in November \n1999, November 2003, December 2004, and September 2007 to visit his parents and \nother family members. He used his Iranian passport on each of these trips to enter Iran, \nin accordance with the laws of Iran. (Ex. 2 at 3-4; Tr. 151.)   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s trip to Iran in 1999 was his first trip back to Iran since leaving in 1979 \nto pursue his education in the United States. He was aware that he was taking risks by \nreturning to Iran because, in the past, he had been identified as an anti-regime activist \nand he had not fulfilled military service required by the government of Iran. However, he \nfelt the risks were worth taking because his father was ill and suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease. Despite his concerns, Applicant\u2019s 1999 visit to Iran was uneventful. In 2003, he \nreturned to Iran alone to visit his parents. (Tr. 121-123.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant took his wife and two children with him to Iran to visit his \nparents. To comply with the laws of Iran, his wife and children, who were U.S. citizens, \nacquired Iranian passports, which they used to enter Iran. When they returned from \ntheir trip, Applicant\u2019s wife and children retained their Iranian passports. At his hearing, \nApplicant stated that he believed the passports were in active status. After his hearing, \nApplicant destroyed the Iranian passports of his wife, his daughter, and his son. (Ex. L; \nTr. 124-125, 152-154.) \n \n \nIn 2007, one of Applicant\u2019s brothers called him and advised him to return to Iran \nto visit their father because the father\u2019s health had worsened. In response to his \nbrother\u2019s plea, Applicant traveled to Iran to visit his father in September 2007. He again \nused his Iranian passport to enter Iran. (Ex. 2 at 6-7; Tr. 126.) \n \n \nIn his interview with an authorized investigator from OPM, Applicant stated that \nhe planned to keep his Iranian passport as long as his father lived. After his father died \nin 2008, Applicant surrendered his Iranian passport to an authorized representative of \nthe Iranian government. He does not intend to travel to Iran in the future. He knows that \nhe cannot enter Iran unless he presents an Iranian passport.  (Ex. 2 at 6-7; Tr. 126-\n129.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor appeared as a witness. He testified that he had \nsupervised Applicant over a period of six years. He reviewed Applicant\u2019s yearly \nperformance ratings and praised his strong work ethic and devotion to mission. He \ncharacterized Applicant\u2019s work as \u201cexcellent.\u201d (Ex. D, Ex. E; Ex. F; Ex. G; Ex. H; Tr. 38-\n64.) \n \n \nThe operations manager and senior vice-president of the government contractor \nthat employs Applicant also testified on his behalf. He stated that Applicant was an \nexcellent employee, hard-working, and very trustworthy. (Tr. 28-36.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife and his neighbor also testified on his behalf. Both witnesses \nemphasized \nApplicant\u2019s \nkindness, \nhelpfulness, \ngood \ncharacter, \nand \nsteady \ntemperament. (Tr. 65-94.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife submitted a financial statement that showed total assets of \n$1.5 million dollars and total liabilities of $190,000. All of their assets are in the United \nStates. Applicant has no financial interests in Iran. He had a financial interest in the \nhome his father lived in before he died. However, Applicant waived any interest in the \nproperty and requested that his share be distributed to the child of his brother who was \nexecuted by the Iranian government in 1982.  (Ex. C; Tr. 139-140.)   \n  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Iran, which appear in \nofficial U.S. government publications:  \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic, founded in 1979 after a revolution that \nremoved the Shah as head of state. Islamic law is the basis for the authority of the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nIranian state. Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the country\u2019s political structure, and ultimate \npolitical power rests in a Shi\u2019a religious scholar, who is called the Supreme Leader. (HE \nIII at 1-2.) \n \n \nThe United States has not had diplomatic or consular relations with Iran since \n1979. In 2006, the President declared the continuation of a 1979 declaration of a \nNational Emergency with Respect to Iran because of Iran\u2019s \u201cextraordinary threat to the \nnational security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.\u201d (HE III, at 1-2.) \n \n \nIran engages in clandestine efforts to illegally obtain U.S. military equipment and \nother sensitive technology and to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD). Additionally, Iran sponsors international terrorism, intervenes in the \ninternal affairs of Iraq and Afghanistan, undermines the Middle East peace process, and \nviolates the human rights of the Iranian people. (HE III at 2-5.) \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens and U.S.-Iranian dual citizens to \nconsider carefully the risks of travel to Iran. Some elements of the Iranian regime are \nhostile to the United States and to U.S. citizens. U.S.-Iranian dual citizens may be \nsubject to harassment or arrest while residing in Iran. Since Iran does not recognize \ndual citizenship, Iranian authorities consider Iranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens and \ntheir children to be solely Iranian citizens. (HE III at 6.) \n \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \n\n \n7 \n \n \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iran must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and the threats to U.S. interests existing in Iran. Since 1979, the \nUnited States has had no diplomatic or consular relations with Iran. Iran seeks nuclear \nweapons, sponsors terrorism, intervenes against U.S. interests in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nand violates the rights of its own citizens. It seeks to obtain, through illegal means, U.S. \nmilitary equipment and other sensitive technology. \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline.  The facts of Applicant\u2019s case raise security concerns under disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation.\u201d  \n \n \nIran is hostile to U.S. interests and actively works to undermine them. Further, it \ntargets its own citizens and violates their human rights in order to advance its own ends. \nFor these reasons, American citizens with immediate family members who are citizens \nor residents of Iran could be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. \n \nApplicant was born in Iran and lived there until, as a young man, he left to pursue \nhis education in the United States. In his absence, his family suffered persecution \nfollowing the Iranian revolution of 1979. One of his brothers was executed for a crime he \ndid not commit. A sister and her husband, a physician, were imprisoned for 3\u00bd years for \nsupporting the brother who was executed. Still another brother was imprisoned for 1\u00bd \nyears on the false charge that he stole a motorcycle. The regime concluded that \nApplicant, who was studying in the United States, was an \u201cactivist\u201d and refused to allow \nhis father the means to send him money for his studies. \n \nApplicant was devoted to his parents who were citizens and residents of Iran. \nDespite his fears that he might be arrested or detained by the Iranian government, he \ntraveled alone to Iran in 1999 to visit his parents and other family members. He returned \nto visit them in 2003. In 2004, he took his wife and two children to Iran to visit his \nparents and family members. In 2007, in response to a call that his father\u2019s health was \nfailing, he returned to Iran to visit his father. Applicant\u2019s four trips to Iran in eight years \ndemonstrated his close ties with his parents and other family members in Iran. \n  \nApplicant\u2019s parents are no longer living, His mother died in 2005, and his father \ndied in 2008. At his hearing, he stated that he had surrendered his Iranian passport and \nno intention to travel to Iran in the future. However, Applicant has two brothers and four \nsisters who are citizens and residents of Iran. These facts raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s case.  \nIf \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply. If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might apply. If \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(c) \nmight apply.  \n \n \nWhen he was interviewed by an authorized investigator from OPM in 2007, \nApplicant reported that he spoke on the telephone with his two brothers in Iran \napproximately once every three months. He spoke with one of his four sisters once a \nyear by telephone, and he communicated with his other sisters when he visited in Iran. \nAdditionally, he reported telephone and e-mail communications with other collateral \nrelatives in Iran who were the children of his siblings. These communications with his \nsiblings and their families arose from long-standing familial relationships and suggested \nconcern, affection, and an on-going pattern of contact. Applicant\u2019s contacts with his \nfamily members were neither casual nor infrequent.  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant reported that his communications with his siblings in \nIran had diminished since his father\u2019s death in May 2008. He was unable to report \nprecisely how many times he had communicated with his brothers, sisters, and \ncollateral family members in the 15 months since his father\u2019s death. When he was cross \nexamined, he reported approximately ten telephone and e-mail communications with his \nsiblings since May 2008. \n \n In ISCR Case No. 07-18283 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 24, 2009), DOHA\u2019s Appeal \nBoard discussed the potential vulnerability of an applicant in a Guideline B case who \nhad four siblings living in Iran. Even though the applicant had reported that his \ncommunications with his siblings in Iran had diminished since his mother\u2019s death in \n2007, the Appeal Board noted the applicant\u2019s previous pattern of attachment and \nobligation to his siblings in Iran and further noted that the entire record, when taken \ntogether, may demonstrate a security concern when:  \n \nthat Applicant\u2019s close relatives reside in a country whose interests are \ncontrary to those of the U.S. In light of the record as a whole, it is \nforeseeable that these relatives could be a means through which Applicant \ncould come to the attention of the regime. His family could be a vehicle \nthrough which Iran might attempt to coerce Applicant. Despite Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony and other evidence that he has no loyalty to Iran, there is not \n\n \n10 \n \n \nsufficient evidence to demonstrate that his ties to the U.S. outweigh his \nsense of obligation to his Iranian relatives. \n \nI conclude that there was insufficient record evidence to establish that Applicant\u2019s   \nnephew is employed by the government of Iran. Accordingly, SOR \u00b6 1.c. is concluded \nfor Applicant. However, Applicant failed to rebut the Government\u2019s allegations that his \ncontacts with his two brothers and four sisters, all citizens and residents of Iran, created \na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion. Applicant\u2019s relationships with these individuals could force him to choose \nbetween loyalty to them and the security interests of the United States.  \n \nAt the same time, the record also supports Applicant\u2019s strong ties to the United \nStates. He married in the United States, and he and his wife have raised their children \nhere. As a citizen of the United States, he has excelled at his career and has developed \nsubstantial financial interests here. I conclude that AG 8(b) applies in part to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. However, an applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a much \nheavier burden to overcome than does an applicant with relatives living in a country with \npolicies that are not contrary to U.S. security concerns. Accordingly, I conclude that \nneither AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) nor 8(c) applies in mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested he was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nwhole person concept and all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant is a talented, honorable, and hard-working U.S. citizen. He is considered to be \na valued employee. He sought to use his experience, skills, and knowledge to serve his \nadopted country, and he sought a security clearance as a government contractor. \n \nApplicant has six siblings who are citizens and residents of Iran. His mother and \nfather, who died in 2005 and 2008, were also citizens and residents of Iran. Applicant \nwas close to his parents while they were living, and, over the years, he had close and \nfamilial relationships with his siblings and some of their children. He donated his share \nof his father\u2019s property to the daughter of his brother who was executed in 1982 by the \nIranian revolutionary regime. At some personal risk, he traveled to Iran four times in the \npast ten years to visit his family members. Applicant is an admirable family member. \nHowever, he failed to extenuate or mitigate the security concerns raised by his contacts \nand relationships with his siblings who are citizens and residents of Iran, a country that \nposes \u201can extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of \nthe United States.\u201d   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under AG  B.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n                                                Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n_______________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM), dated July 15, 2009, was provided to him by letter \ndated July 16, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on July 21, 2009. He was afforded a \nperiod of 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \n \n6 Item 6 at 3-4 and Item 7 at 4. \n \n7 Item 3 and Item 5. \n \n8 Item 6 at 4 and Item 7 at 4. \n \n9 Item 7 at 3. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guideline H (Drug Involvement).  \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern relations to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides three Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any drug abuse;\u201d  \n\u201c(b) testing positive for illegal drug use;\u201d and \u201c(c) illegal drug possession including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.\u201d Applicant\u2019s consistent and habitual use of marijuana over 11 years, \nhis purchase of marijuana, and his failing a drug test fulfill disqualifying conditions under \nGuideline H. The government established these three disqualifying conditions requiring \nadditional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \n Considering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find two Drug \nInvolvement Mitigating Conditions potentially applicable: AG \u00b6 26(a) \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d and AG \u00b6 26(b): \u201ca demonstrated intent not to \nabuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation form drug-using associates \nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d  \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d10 \n \n10 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle change and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal Board \nstated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the \nrecency analysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply as the behavior did not happen so long ago. Applicant \nadmittedly used marijuana until approximately one year ago. Considering his 11 years \nof use, this short passage of time cannot qualify as \u201cso long ago.\u201d In addition, his use \nwas frequent under AG \u00b6 26(a) as he admits to over 100 uses and use on a weekly \nbasis from 2004 through 2008. The circumstances of his use also do not indicate that \nfuture use is unlikely under AG \u00b6 26(a) because as noted supra, Applicant used \nmarijuana for years well into adulthood. Such continued marijuana use demonstrates a \ndisregard for law and the seriousness of the conduct involved. These circumstances \nundercut any claim that his use does not cast doubt on his reliability and judgment \nunder AG \u00b6 26(a). \nAG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. This mitigating condition requires a demonstrated \nintent not to abuse drugs in the future. While Applicant states that he will not use illegal \ndrugs, he has demonstrated only a short period of abstinence. Applicant\u2019s decision to \nstop using drugs did not occur under circumstances involving a life changing event. \nRather, he stopped using marijuana around the time he applied for a job in the defense \nindustry where he is required to have a security clearance and where he was fired from \na defense contractor for testing positive for marijuana. The evidence does not support \napplication of the remaining mitigating conditions contained in \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d). \nApplicant\u2019s 11-year history of consistent drug involvement and lack of favorable \nevidence preclude a finding that he has established a track record of abstinence and a \ncommitment to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Based on the available \nevidence, his drug involvement is relatively recent and not isolated. He has not carried \nhis burden of mitigating the Drug Involvement concerns identified. His past conduct \ncasts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s record of employment working for a government contractor weighs in \nhis favor. Aside from his admitted drug involvement, he appears to be a law-abiding \ncitizen. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation.   \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. He has \na significant history of drug involvement that was ongoing for 11 years. Applicant \nsubmitted no documentation from a qualified medical professional demonstrating a \ncurrent or future favorable prognosis. For these reasons and reasons discussed supra, \nfurther time is needed and additional evidence is necessary before Applicant would be \neligible for a security clearance. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to Drug Involvement.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline H:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.c.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated Personal Conduct concerns but has not mitigated Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nOn July 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nF and E, Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 17, 2009, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on September 14, 2009. A complete copy of \nJanuary 12, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nthe file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on September 22, 2009. As of \nNovember 25, 2009, he had not responded. The case was assigned to me on \nDecember 7, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He attended college \nfor a period, but it is unclear if he has a degree. He is single, with a nine-year-old child.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts and that Applicant misused his corporate \ncredit card in 2006 and 2007, to make personal purchases in violation of company \npolicy. The SOR further alleges that he voluntarily terminated his employment and \nmade restitution. He admitted the debts totaling about $15,225 alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b. He denied the remaining allegations, with explanations. \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he violated company policy when he used his corporate \ncredit card for personal reasons in 2007. He used the corporate card because he was \nhaving financial difficulties. He informed his manager of his actions before the company \ndiscovered them. He was told that he would not be terminated, and a restitution plan \nwas put in place. The charges were paid. Applicant voluntarily left the company in \nDecember 2007, for a position with another company.2  \n \n \nApplicant has experienced financial problems for a number of years. He listed a \nnumber of delinquent debts when he submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) in December 2005. He told an investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) in August 2008, that his debts became delinquent \nbecause he was paying arrears on child support and had a large truck loan payment. \nHe stated that he would pay his delinquent debts through a home equity loan. He was \nunable to obtain a home equity loan because of his credit history. No payments have \nbeen made on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.3  \n \n \n \nApplicant stated that he settled the $529 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, with a \npayment of $381 on August 2009. He disputed owing the $159 debt to a collection \ncompany on behalf of a telephone services company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He \n                                                          \n1 Item 5.  \n \n2 Items 4, 6, 10. \n \n3 Items 5-7. Any delinquent debts or financial issues that were not alleged in the SOR will not be \nused for disqualification purposes, but will be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s overall financial \nsituation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in evaluating the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nadmitted that he had an account with the company but indicated the account was paid \nwhen he relocated.4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n                                                          \n4 Items 4, 6. \n \n\n \n4 \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, \nfiling deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches \nof trust. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. He misused his corporate credit card to make \npersonal purchases in violation of company policy. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n5 \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not resolved the two largest debts alleged in the SOR. His \nfinancial issues are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant stated that his debts became delinquent because he was paying \narrears on child support and had a large truck loan payment. That does not qualify as \nconditions that were outside his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant received financial counseling. He informed \nhis company about the corporate credit card, and he paid the charges. AG \u00b6 20(c) is \napplicable to SOR \u00b6 1.e. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that his \noverall financial problems are being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not \napplicable to the other allegations.  \n \n \nApplicant settled one debt for $381. AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable to the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. That payment does not support a finding that he made a good-faith effort \nto pay or resolve all his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable to the unpaid \ndebts. \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the $159 debt to a telephone services provider. He told \nhis company about his misuse of the credit card, and he admitted to owing two much \nlarger debts. Applicant established that he has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.d. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to that debt.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s misuse of his corporate credit card was also alleged under the \nFinancial Considerations guideline. That behavior, when considered as a whole, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It is also conduct that could create a \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are \napplicable. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nApplicant informed his company about the credit card, and he made restitution. \nHe voluntarily left the company more than two years ago for another job. He has taken \npositive steps to reduce his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. \nApplicant has mitigated the Personal Conduct concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n7 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has experienced financial difficulties for a number of years, which he \nattributed to his paying arrears on child support and a large truck loan payment. He \nmisused his corporate card because of his financial problems. He informed his company \nabout the credit card and paid the charges. He was honest about his delinquent debts. \nHowever, two large debts remain unpaid. There is not enough evidence in the record for \nme to conclude that his finances are in order.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated Personal Conduct concerns but has not mitigated \nFinancial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is\ndenied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn January 8, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nH, Drug Involvement. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines. \nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR on February 8, 2010. He\nadmitted all of the allegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me\non April 5, 2010. On May 17, 2010, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case\nfor June 8, 2010. The hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, I received three\nAugust 13, 2010\n\n2\ngovernment exhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received the transcript on June\n16, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 34-year-old married man with two children ages two and four. He\nhas a high school education. Since 2000, he has worked as an electrician. (Tr. 14)\nCurrently, he works for a DoD subcontractor maintaining critical electrical systems and\ntemperature control. (Tr. 16) Also, he works as an instructor at a local electrician\u2019s union\nwhere he teaches alternative energy, photovoltaics, and fuel cells. (Tr. 15) \nApplicant entered the United States Navy in 1993. After testing positive for\nmarijuana, he was administratively separated \u201cby reason of Misconduct Due to\nCommission of a Serious Offense\u201d in 1996. His discharge status was general under\nhonorable conditions. (GE 3 at 3)\nWith the exception of a one-year period of abstinence in 2004, Applicant has\nsmoked marijuana every day since 1996. He typically smokes marijuana after work.\nOnce, while the security clearance application process was pending, he smoked it while\ncarpooling to work in a company vehicle. (Tr. 25, 26) His most recent use was the night\nbefore the hearing. (Tr. 19-20, 26)\nApplicant spends approximately $200 per month on marijuana. During the week\nbefore the hearing, he purchased it on seven occasions. (Tr. 26)\nApplicant\u2019s one year abstinence period in 2004, as noted above, was triggered\nby his failure of a drug test administered by the electrician\u2019s union. (Tr. 23) At the time,\nhe was completing his apprenticeship. The union required him to attend drug counseling\nas a condition of continued membership. (Tr. 23) \nApplicant remained drug-free through the remainder of his apprenticeship. (Tr.\n23) After completing his apprenticeship and attaining journeyman status, Applicant\nresumed using marijuana. He did so because the union does not test licensed\nelectricians and can no longer \u201cinfluence . . . whether or not [he] use[s].\u201d (Tr. 23)\nWhen asked on cross-examination whether he intends to continue using\nmarijuana, Applicant responded as follows:\nAt this point, I do intend to continue using marijuana. However, if it\nbecomes an issue with employment, I would obviously stop. (Tr. 21)\n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These\nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 two(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement\nUnder 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c, \u201cthe head of a Federal agency may not grant or renew a\nsecurity clearance for a covered person who is an unlawful user of a controlled\nsubstance or an addict.\u201d This statute is applicable only if the person is currently an\nunlawful user or addict. (See ISCR Case No. 03-25009 (App. Bd. June. 28, 2005)) \nAbsent a clinical diagnosis, I do not conclude Applicant is addicted to marijuana.\nConversely, there is ample evidence that Applicant is a current user of marijuana.\nSpecifically, he smoked marijuana daily for at least 14 years, and maintained this\nfrequency unabated through the night before the hearing. Moreover, his only period of\nabstinence in the past 15 years occurred when he was required to undergo periodic\ndrug testing as a condition of membership in a trade union. As soon as this requirement\nceased, he resumed smoking marijuana. Most importantly, Applicant admitted that he\nwill continue to use marijuana.\nEven if 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c did not bar Applicant from possessing a security\nclearance, I would still conclude that granting him a clearance is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest. Under the adjudicative guideline governing drug involvement,\n\u201cuse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\n\n4\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations\u201d (AG \u00b6 24). Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana use, his failed drug\ntests, and his intention to use marijuana in the future trigger the application of the\ndisqualifying conditions set forth in of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d 25(b), \u201ctesting\npositive for illegal drugs,\u201d 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug\nparaphernalia,\u201d and 25(h), \u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to\nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use.\u201d None of the mitigating\nconditions apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nGiven the significant length and frequency of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and the lack of\nany rehabilitation, I conclude that Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On \nOctober 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines B and C. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n                                                          \n1 In several of the documents in the record, Applicant identifies herself by using her middle name instead \nof her first name.

The request for a \nhearing is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. The case was assigned to \nme on January 19, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 26, 2010, \nscheduling the hearing for February 19, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which were \nadmitted without objection. I kept the record open until March 5, 2010 to enable her to \nsubmit additional documentary evidence. She timely submitted AX D.

The facts administratively noticed are set out \nbelow in my findings of fact. \n \nCorrection of SOR \n \n \nOn motion of Department Counsel, I corrected SOR \u00b6 2.b to allege that \nApplicant\u2019s Taiwanese passport will expire in July 2010, instead of July 2001 as \noriginally alleged. (Tr. 84-85.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n2.a, and 2.c. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old guidance navigation and control engineer employed by \na defense contractor since September 2007. She was promoted to her current position \nin the summer of 2008. (Tr. 42.) She has received two performance awards from her \nemployer. (AX B and C.) She has never held a clearance. \n \n \nApplicant was born in Taiwan. She moved to Canada with her family when she \nwas nine years old. She returned to Taiwan to attend middle school three years later \nand then returned to Canada for three years, where she completed high school. (Tr. 35-\n38.) Her parents remained in Taiwan to care for their parents while she attended high \n\n \n3 \n \n \nschool, and she lived in a dormitory. (Tr. 38-39.) She came to the United States in \nAugust 2001 to attend college. Applicant completed her undergraduate education and \nreceived a master\u2019s degree in May 2006.  \n \nApplicant became a U. S. citizen in June 2007. She uses Facebook, an internet \nsocial website, to stay in contact with some of her middle school friends in Taiwan and \nthe United States. She does not know if her Taiwanese friends are connected to the \ngovernment of Taiwan. She has numerous friends in the United States. Her boyfriend is \na U.S. citizen. (Tr. 60-61, 71.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents obtained U.S. permanent resident cards in August 2001. (AX \nD.) They have since returned to Taiwan. Applicant talks to her parents by telephone \nevery two weeks. (Tr. 57.) She has no assets in Taiwan, does not depend on her \nparents for financial support, and provides no financial support to her parents. (Tr. 55-\n56, 70.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is the manager of a frozen food company. His company bids on \ngovernment contracts and regularly sells food products to the government for use by the \nTaiwanese military. (Tr. 47.) Her mother is not employed outside the home. Her brother \nis a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States, and he resides in the United States. \nHer two sisters are dual citizens of Taiwan and Canada, and they both reside in the \nUnited States.  \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Taiwan every year from 2002 to 2008 to visit her family. She \ndid not surrender her Taiwanese passport when she became a U.S. citizen, and she \nused her Taiwanese passport when she traveled to Taiwan in 2007 because she had \nnot yet received her U.S. passport. (Tr. 64.) She used her Taiwanese passport again in \nNovember 2008, because it allowed her to stay in the country more than 30 days. (GX 2 \nat 7.) The Taiwanese passport does not expire until July 2011, but she surrendered it to \nher facility security officer in February 2010. (AX A.) \n \n \nApplicant testified she has no intention to return to Taiwan, except to visit. She \nhas spent so much time in the United States and Canada that she finds it difficult to fit \ninto the culture of Taiwan. (Tr. 73-74.) \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following adjudicative facts about \nTaiwan. It is a multi-party democracy, established as a separate, independent \ngovernment by refugees from mainland China in 1949. The People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) does not recognize Taiwan\u2019s independence and insists there is only one China.  \nThe United States recognized Taiwan as an independent government until January \n1979, when it formally recognized the PRC government as the sole legal government of \nChina. Taiwan has developed a strong economy and has significant economic contacts \nwith the PRC. The PRC maintains intelligence operations in Taiwan, using PRC \nnationals with Taiwanese connections. Taiwan maintains a large military establishment \nto protect itself from the PRC. For many years, Taiwan has been an active collector of \nU.S. economic intelligence, and there have been numerous instances of U.S. \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncompanies involved in illegal export, or attempted export, of sensitive, dual-use \ntechnology to Taiwan. There is also some evidence that Taiwanese intelligence officials \nhave specifically targeted U.S. citizens to obtain protected and classified information. \nTaiwan is a stable and vibrant democracy, and there is no evidence that the \ngovernment of Taiwan is likely to resort to coercive measures against its citizens to \ncollect economic intelligence.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \n\n \n5 \n \n \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Taiwan (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a) and she traveled to Taiwan every year from 2002 through 2008 SOR \u00b6 1.b). The \nsecurity concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, \n2002). Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United \nStates, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human \nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members \nare vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the United States. \n  \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: AG \u00b6 7(a) (\u201ccontact \nwith a foreign family member . . . if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d); and AG \u00b6 7(b) \n(\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential \nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information\u201d). Applicant\u2019s contacts with her parents and her connections \nto Taiwan create the \u201cheightened risk\u201d contemplated by AG \u00b6 7(a) and the \u201cpotential \nconflict of interest\u201d contemplated by AG \u00b6 7(b). Both disqualifying conditions are raised. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual travel to Taiwan was to visit her parents and other family \nmembers. As such, it has no independent security significance. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n26978 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant has a close relationship with her family members and a \nsocial relationship with some of her middle school classmates in Taiwan. Her father\u2019s \ncompany does business with the government on a regular basis. I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n8(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing \u201cthere \nis no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to \nthe foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has \nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n8(b). Although Applicant is close to her family, she feels no emotional or cultural \nattachment to Taiwan. She has lived apart from her family since high school, and her \ntestimony and demeanor at the hearing suggest that she has become quite \nindependent. Her siblings, most of her friends, and her current boyfriend are citizens \nand residents of the United States. Her career aspirations are focused on the United \nStates. She has been a U.S. citizen for a relatively short period of time, but she has \nlived in a Western culture since high school, and she applied for U.S. citizenship shortly \nafter she became eligible. The possibility of Applicant being subjected to indirect \n\n \n7 \n \n \npressure through her parents is unlikely, because Taiwan is not known to abuse its \ncitizens to obtain foreign economic intelligence. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with her middle school classmates are limited to Facebook \nexchanges. The evidence about her Taiwanese classmates and the content of their \nconversations is sparse and is insufficient to establish this mitigating condition. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant exercised her Taiwanese dual citizenship by \npossessing and using a Taiwanese passport. The concern under this guideline is as \nfollows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or \nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. \n \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision. ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000). Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 1999). \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is not limited to countries hostile to the \nU.S. \u201cUnder the facts of a given case, an applicant\u2019s preference, explicit or implied, \neven for a nation with which the U.S. has enjoyed long and peaceful relations, might \npose a challenge to U.S. interests.\u201d ADP Case No. 07-14939 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, \n2009). \n \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited \nto \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). Applicant\u2019s possession and \nuse of her Taiwanese passport after becoming a U.S. citizen raise this disqualifying \ncondition. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n11(a). Applicant derived her Taiwanese citizenship from her parents, but she actively \nexercised it by keeping and using her Taiwanese passport. This mitigating condition is \napplicable, but its mitigating effect is diminished by Applicant\u2019s active exercise of \nTaiwanese citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may be \nmitigated if \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(e). This mitigating condition is established. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B and C in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is well-educated and intelligent, but she is young and inexperienced \nregarding the security clearance process. She was very candid and sincere at the \nhearing. She surrendered her Taiwanese passport when she learned that it raised \nsecurity concerns. She has spent more of her life in the United States and Canada than \nin Taiwan, and she is more comfortable with the Western culture than the culture of \nTaiwan. Although her parents have returned to Taiwan, they have demonstrated their \naffinity for Western culture by educating their children in Canada and the United States \nand obtaining U.S. permanent resident cards. Although her father sells food products to \nthe Taiwanese government from time to time, her parents are not employed by the \ngovernment or a high technology business where they would be more likely to be \ninvolved in economic espionage, vulnerable to exploitation, or likely conduits of indirect \npressure on Applicant. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and \nC, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence and foreign \npreference. Accordingly, I conclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Robert M. Shepard, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant is a 22-year-old recent college graduate who smoked marijuana three\ntimes from the spring of 2007 to late July 2008, while he held a secret-level security\nclearance for his duties as an intern with his defense contractor employer. Drug\ninvolvement concerns are mitigated by a demonstrated intent to abstain from illegal\ndrugs in the future. Personal conduct concerns raised by his failure to disclose his\nmarijuana use on his security clearance application are not fully mitigated. Clearance is\ndenied.\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on August 14, 2008. On June 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement, and Guideline E, personal\nconduct, that provided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny him a security\nclearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nMarch 19, 2010\n\nThe Questionnaire for National Security Positions is a component of the e-QIP, which  was admitted\n1\ninto evidence as Exhibit 1.\n2\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 14, 2009, and he requested a hearing.\nOn July 28, 2009, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. Counsel for Applicant entered his appearance on August 27, 2009, and on\nSeptember 1, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for October 28, 2009. On October 21, 2009,\nApplicant submitted an amended answer dated October 20, 2009, in which he provided\ndetailed responses to the SOR allegations. This amended answer was accepted in lieu\nof Applicant\u2019s pro se response.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled on October 28, 2009. Two government\nexhibits (Ex. 1-2) and eight Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-H) were entered into evidence\nwithout any objections. Applicant and three witnesses testified on his behalf, as\nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on November 9, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H, drug involvement, that Applicant used\nmarijuana about four times from the spring of 2007 to at least the summer of 2008 (SOR\n1.a) while he held a secret-level security clearance granted in November 2006 (SOR\n1.b), and that he continued to attend social functions where others might use illegal\ndrugs as of April 2009 (SOR 1.c). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was\nalleged to have deliberately falsified his August 2008 Questionnaire for National\nSecurity Positions  by not disclosing his marijuana use (SOR 2.a), including while he\n1\npossessed a secret clearance (SOR 2.b). DOHA also cross-alleged under Guideline E\nhis continued attendance at social functions that may include illegal drug use by others\n(SOR 2.c).\nIn his amended Answer, Applicant admitted that he smoked marijuana when it\nwas passed to him in a joint on three or four separate occasions, delineated as once\neach in the spring of 2007, in the spring of 2008, and in the summer of 2008. Applicant\ndenied any subsequent involvement with marijuana, any purchase of marijuana, and\nany sale of marijuana. Applicant also acknowledged that he had been granted a\nDepartment of Defense secret-level clearance in November 2006, and an interim top-\nsecret clearance in the summer of 2008. He denied any use of marijuana while he held\nan interim top-secret clearance. As for any ongoing association with drug users,\nApplicant acknowledged that he had resided in an off-campus apartment between April\n27, 2009 and May 10, 2009, where parties were held at the complex, but he had no\ncontrol over the guests or over whether marijuana was used at these social events.\nAfter his college graduation in May 2009, he moved home and was no longer attending\n\n3\nany social functions where others might be engaged in illegal drug use. As for his\nomission of his marijuana use from his security questionnaire, Applicant admitted his\n\u201cmistakes of omission,\u201d but he averred that he had immediately revealed his drug use to\na government investigator before any questioning began.\nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 22-year-old computer software engineer, who has been employed\nfull-time by a defense contractor since July 2009 (Tr. 25-26). W hile he wa s in  h igh\nschool, Applicant was involved in a robotics program sponsored by his current employer\n(Tr. 28). Following his graduation in June 2005,  Applicant began a paid internship with\nthe company. He worked during school vacations and each summer while he was\nattending college from September 2005 to May 2009 (Ex. 1, Tr. 28-29). In November\n2006, he was granted a Department of Defense secret-level security clearance for his\nduties with the defense contractor (Exs. 1, F, Tr. 53, 56).\nApplicant was involved in playing and refereeing soccer as a youth (Ex. C), and\nhe continued these activities while he was in college. He played club and intramural\nsoccer, and was involved in an athletic spirit organization (Exs. E, F, Tr. 30-31).\nApplicant was responsible in his studies, civic commitments, and in making sure that he\nand his roommates paid their bills on time (Exs. E, F). Although marijuana use was\nprevalent at social gatherings on weekends in college, including at some parties that he\nattended, he did not use any illegal drugs at those functions (Ex. 2, Tr. 42, 65).\nHowever, while in Florida with a friend during spring break in 2007, Applicant took a hit\noff a marijuana \u201cjoint\u201d passed to him at a party (Tr. 38). One year later, in the spring of\n2008, he was at a local bar watching a sporting event when he again took a hit off a\njoint passed to him (Tr. 38). In late July 2008, he smoked marijuana with a female\ncousin (Tr. 39, 67-68). Again the drug was passed to him. He did not seek it (Tr. 39).\nApplicant had been drinking alcohol on each of the three occasions where he smoked\nmarijuana (Tr. 74), although he knew when he used the drug that he was engaging in\nillegal activity (Tr. 69). \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor requested that he apply for an upgrade of his security\nclearance (Tr. 31) for his duties as an engineering intern (Ex. D). Applicant completed\nan e-QIP on August 14, 2008. He checked off \u201cNo\u201d to questions 24.a, \u201cSince the age of\n16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled\nsubstance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium,\nmorphine, \ncodeine, \nheroin, \netc.), \namphetamines, \ndepressants \n(barbiturates,\nmethaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.) or prescription\ndrugs?\u201d and 24.b, \u201cHave you ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed\nas a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a\nsecurity clearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting the public\nsafety?\u201d (Ex. 1). Applicant did not disclose his drug use because it did not have a big\nimpact on his life, he did not want to be \u201cput in a pile with drug addicted people\u201d (Tr. 34),\nand telling an investigator in person would be \u201cthe best way to go\u201d (Tr. 58, 61). From\ndiscussions he had with persons who held top-secret clearances, Applicant believed\n\nThe ELDP manager testified that the company typically reviews between 500 and 1,000 resumes\n2\nfrom college seniors for the program, out of which only 15 are selected. Of those 15, Applicant was one of\nthree in the computer software area (Tr. 112-13).\nAt his hearing, Applicant explained what he meant by \u201coversight,\u201d as follows:\n3\nThe oversight is, I believe would be due to [sic] because when I spoke with him, I said, like\nI said here, I felt like my occasions were so remote and had no impact, that like how, I didn\u2019t\nreally feel, see the importance of the occasions and I felt comfortable just telling him about\nthat, and so that\u2019s what the oversight is (Tr. 63).\n4\nthat he would be interviewed during a \u201cvery thorough\u201d background investigation for his\ntop-secret clearance (Tr. 70-71).\nIn August 2008, Applicant applied for his employer\u2019s highly selective engineering\nleadership development program (ELDP) (Ex. G).  Under the program, selectees earn a\n2\nmaster\u2019s degree in three years while gaining valuable work experience and promotion to\na senior engineering level position at the end of the program (Tr. 45, 110). Applicant\nwas chosen for the ELDP based on his work ethic, leadership, experience, and personal\nintegrity. A recruiter for the program, who is in the third year of the ELDP (Tr. 51),\nremained in contact with Applicant during his senior year in college. He observed no\nbehavior by Applicant that would lead him to question Applicant\u2019s selection for this\nprogram (Ex. D).\nOn October 15, 2008, Applicant was interviewed at college by a government\ninvestigator, who reviewed his e-QIP with him. When question 24.a was read to him,\nApplicant responded that his answer was incorrect, and that he had smoked marijuana\non three occasions (Tr. 36, 75). Applicant told the investigator that he omitted his\nmarijuana use from his e-QIP because it was only a few instances. He attributed his\nnegative response to whether he used any illegal drug while possessing a security\nclearance to \u201coversight\u201d (Ex. 2).  Applicant was subsequently given an opportunity by\n3\nDOHA to review a report of the investigator containing these representations. Applicant\nmade no corrections (Ex. 2).\nOn April 27, 2009, Applicant indicated in response to DOHA drug interrogatories\nthat he had used marijuana with remote frequency, on four occasions, between the\nspring of 2007 and his last use in the summer of 2008. Applicant listed four occasions,\neven though he specifically recalled three instances, just to make sure that he covered\nhimself if he should later recall another occasion, given the prevalence of drugs at\nparties in college (Tr. 40, 64). He denied any future intent to use illegal substances\nbecause of his government security clearance, and he saw nothing positive to be\ngained from drug use (Ex. 2, Tr. 41). Yet, in response to whether he associates with\npersons who use illegal substances or frequents places where he has reason to believe\ndrugs are being used or are used in his presence, Applicant wrote, \u201cMarijuana use in\ncollege is nearly as prevalent as alcohol. When attending parties (Fri./Sat nights) there\nis almost always the presence of marijuana.\u201d He declined offers of drug use, except on\nthe three occasions detailed. As to whether he had made any changes indicative of a\nlifestyle away from past drug usage, Applicant responded that while he was still in\n\n5\ncollege, he recognized \u201cthe importance of maintaining a proper self-image and [abiding]\nby the laws.\u201d (Ex. 2).\nIn May 2009, Applicant earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and\nengineering (Ex. F). He left off-campus housing and moved back home to live with his\nparents (Answer). He has since found it easier to control his environment. In late June\nor early July 2009, Applicant found himself in the presence of others smoking\nmarijuana. He and a friend, also an employee of the same defense contractor, had gone\nover to another friend\u2019s home and came upon people smoking marijuana on the friend\u2019s\nporch. Applicant and his companion left after exchanging greetings with their friend and\nthey did not use any marijuana (Tr. 47, 76). Applicant has made it clear to his family and\nclose friends that he does not intend to participate in any illegal substances in any way\nin the future (Tr. 48). He does not have any close friends who currently use marijuana,\nbut some of his friends, whom he may see in public places (not private settings) still use\nmarijuana (Tr. 77). About twice a year, Applicant sees his cousin with whom he smoked\nmarijuana in 2008. During their last visit in July 2009, she did not use marijuana (Tr. 69).\nSometime after Applicant submitted his e-QIP for a clearance upgrade to top-\nsecret for his intern\u2019s duties, the ELDP manager contacted Applicant about finding him\nhis first rotational assignment in the incoming ELDP class (Tr. 121). Applicant notified\nthe manager of the ELDP that there would be some issues with his security clearance\nbecause he had smoked marijuana in the past and had not disclosed his drug use on\nhis e-QIP (Tr. 44-45, 101). On issuance of the SOR to Applicant on June 30, 2009,\nApplicant\u2019s interim top-secret security clearance was withdrawn (Tr. 43). Applicant had\nbeen slated for a position in the upcoming ELDP program that involved classified work.\nA different placement was found for Applicant that would allow him to work on\nunclassified matters for upwards of a year (Tr. 116), and in mid-July 2009, Applicant\nbecame a full-time employee in his company\u2019s ELDP (Tr. 44). Applicant\u2019s employer\ndoes not condone illegal drug abuse by its employees (Tr. 106). When Applicant\nbecame a full-time employee, he took a drug test that he passed (Tr. 65-66).\nApplicant\u2019s job is very important to him (Tr. 46), and he understands that any\nfuture drug involvement could potentially result in the loss of his employment (Tr. 49).\nOn October 27, 2009, Applicant executed an \u201cAffidavit of Compliance Agreement\u201d in\nwhich he indicated he would not use marijuana or otherwise engage in any illicit\nsubstance use in the future, he had no intent to smoke marijuana or other illegal drug in\nthe future, and he understood that any use of marijuana would result in immediate\nviolation of the agreement and revocation of his security clearance (Ex. H).\nSome of Applicant\u2019s coworkers were disappointed in him on learning that he had\nlost his clearance because of his drug use and not disclosing his marijuana use on his\ne-QIP (Tr. 44). Applicant has the support of those company employees for whom he\nworked as an intern in the summer of 2007 (Ex. B, Tr. 101-03), of the ELDP student in\ncharge of recruiting activity for the ELDP (Ex. D), and of the ELDP manager (Tr. 119).\nApplicant was a punctual and hard-working intern, and he has been an excellent and\nreliable employee. Applicant called the employee for whom he worked directly in 2007,\nand he discussed with him the details of his failure to disclose information and the\n\n6\n\u201cactual incidents in question\u201d (Ex. B). The manager of the department also had a\ndiscussion with Applicant after he learned from the ELDP manager that Applicant had\nlost his clearance (Tr. 105). Despite learning from Applicant that he had used marijuana\nand had not told the truth about his drug use on his e-QIP (Tr. 101), he still has a high\nopinion of Applicant and his value to their employer (Tr. 101-03). The ELDP manager\nlikewise has no present concerns about Applicant and any drug use. Applicant told him\nthat he freely offered the information about his e-QIP omission to the government\ninvestigator (Tr. 118), and Applicant seemed to him \u201cquite remorseful about this having\ncome up and frankly pretty scared when he first approached the topic with [him]\u201d (Tr.\n119).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\n\n7\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement\nThe security concern about drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nApplicant smoked marijuana cigarettes passed to him on three occasions\nbetween the spring of 2007 and late July 2008, while he held a secret-level security\nclearance. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after\nbeing granted a security clearance,\u201d apply. AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession,\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia,\u201d applies only in the limited sense that Applicant can be said to have\nhad physical custody or possession of the marijuana when he smoked it.\nApplicant\u2019s abuse of marijuana may reasonably be characterized as infrequent.\nHowever, his claim of mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is likely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d is not particularly persuasive, given the relative recency of his abuse and the\nfact that it occurred while he held a secret-level security clearance.\n\n8\nConcerning whether Applicant has demonstrated an intent to forego future drug\nabuse sufficient to satisfy AG \u00b6 26(b), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in\nthe future,\u201d Applicant has not completely ceased all relations with drug-using associates\nand contacts. See AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) (stating, \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts\u201d). About twice yearly, he continues to see the female cousin with whom he\nsmoked marijuana in July 2008, although no marijuana was involved when they last met\nin July 2009. Some of his friends, who he may see in public places, still use marijuana.\nHowever, he does not have any close friends who currently use marijuana, and he has\ninformed his friends and family members that he does not intend to participate in any\nway with illegal drugs in the future. While the government has legitimate concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s attendance as of late April 2009 at social functions where drugs might be\nused, the risk of him relapsing is lessened considerably by his move into his parents\u2019\nhome after college. This change in living environment, when coupled with his efforts to\navoid situations where illegal drugs are present, warrants application of AG \u00b6 26(b)(2),\n\u201cchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used.\u201d Applicant\u2019s present 15\nmonths of abstinence is sufficient to demonstrate his intent not to abuse any drugs in\nfuture under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), \u201can appropriate period of abstinence,\u201d considering he\nsmoked marijuana only three or perhaps four times over a 16 or 17-month time span,\nwhen he was under 22 years of age. Also, on October 27, 2009, Applicant signed a\nstatement of intent to refrain from drug abuse with the understanding that any violation\nwould result in automatic revocation of his security clearance. AG \u00b6 26(b)(4), \u201ca signed\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation,\u201d applies.\nApplicant\u2019s employment situation serves as a significant deterrent to any future\ndrug abuse. As one of only three chosen in the computer science field for his\nemployer\u2019s ELDP, Applicant stands to lose the opportunity to earn his master\u2019s degree\nwhile earning an income and receiving valuable work experience. He credibly asserted\nthat he had \u201clearned [his] lesson\u201d (Tr. 67), and nothing positive can be gained by using\nillicit substances. Given the limited extent of his drug involvement in the past, it does not\nappear that he would have any difficulty abiding by his stated intent to continue to\nabstain. Based on all the evidence, AG \u00b6 26(b) applies to mitigate his marijuana use.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant exercised poor judgment within the context of AG \u00b6 15 when he abused\nmarijuana while holding an active security clearance (SOR 2.c). He may not have been\nthinking about his clearance obligations when he accepted the offers to smoke\nmarijuana, but he knew he was violating the law by doing so. While the concerns about\n\nIn his amended Answer, Applicant indicated that he immediately revealed his \u201cerrors\u201d to the\n4\ninvestigator before any questioning began. At his hearing, he admitted that the investigator read the drug\nquestion and he indicated in response that he had tried marijuana three times (Tr. 75).\n9\nhis illicit substance abuse are more appropriately covered under Guideline H, supra,\npersonal conduct AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about\none\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional, or community standing,\u201d is pertinent. Drug abuse is conduct, which if\nknown, could adversely affect one\u2019s reputation, and Applicant testified that some of his\ncoworkers were disappointed with him when they learned he had used an illegal drug\nbecause they have very high expectations of him (Tr. 44).\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d is also implicated. Applicant was not forthright about his marijuana use\nwhen he completed his August 2008 e-QIP. He may well have preferred to disclose\ndetails of his drug involvement during his subject interview, but it does not justify his\nintentional false denials of illegal drug use, including drug use while he held a security\nclearance. He knew that his negative responses to questions 24.a and 24.b were false.\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of the drug inquiries in August 2008 is too recent and too\nserious to be mitigated by AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d He is credited with revealing his drug\ninvolvement to a government investigator during his interview on October 15, 2008.\nHowever, AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts,\u201d cannot\nfully apply. His rectification was voluntary in that he was not confronted with evidence of\nhis drug use before he corrected the record, but he waited until the investigator\nreviewed the drug questions with him.  Applicant cannot be accorded full credit for a\n4\nprompt rectification where the timeliness of the correction is due largely to when the\ninvestigator called him for an interview rather than Applicant first notifying the\ngovernment or his employer of his omissions.\nBy revealing to the ELDP manager and subsequently other coworkers that he\nhad used marijuana in the past, Applicant has \u201ctaken positive steps to reduce or\neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d under AG \u00b6 17(e), but\nApplicant has yet to demonstrate that he understands the importance of, and can be\ncounted on to comply with, his obligation to provide true and complete information\nduring the security clearance process. When asked at his hearing about his rationale for\ndenying any drug use while he held a security clearance, Applicant testified, \u201cWell, if\nyou answer no to the first one [about any drug use in the last 7 years or since age 16],\nyou kind of have to answer no to the second one\u201d (Tr. 61). But when he was interviewed\n\n10\nin October 2008, he told the investigator that he responded negatively to whether he\nused drugs while possessing a security clearance because of \u201coversight\u201d (Ex. 2). When\nasked to explain at his hearing what he meant by \u201coversight,\u201d Applicant responded:\nThe oversight is, I believe would be due to because when I spoke with [the\ninvestigator], I said, like I said here, I felt like my occasions were so\nremote and had no impact, that like how, I didn\u2019t really feel, see the\nimportance of the occasions and I felt comfortable just telling him about\nthat, and so that\u2019s what the oversight is (Tr. 63).\nTo omit information due to oversight is to err due to inattention or failure to notice\nsomething. Whether or not Applicant intended to imply that he made an inadvertent\nmistake, his explanation shows an ongoing tendency to rationalize or minimize his\nfalsifications. Applicant testified that he understood the importance of full candor on his\nsecurity clearance application (Tr. 62), but under the circumstances, I cannot apply AG\n17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d  \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct\nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at\nAG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant displayed poor judgment in using marijuana. Yet, his drug use was\nlimited to only a few times, before he was a full-time employee of the defense\ncontractor. Changes in his environment and lifestyle, including full-time employment in a\nleadership program at work, serve as a significant deterrent to any future drug abuse by\nApplicant. Yet, Applicant\u2019s falsification of his application for a top-secret security\nclearance in August 2008 raises considerable doubts about whether his representations\ncan be fully relied on. Personal concerns that he did not want to be labeled a drug user\n\n11\ndid not justify his lack of candor on his e-QIP. His subsequent efforts to downplay or\nminimize the seriousness of his false statements cast doubt about his reform at this\ntime.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant, who is 51 years old, works as a tempest engineer for a Department of Defense contractor. Since 1991, Applicant has worked as an engineer for his current employer, except for two periods of employment elsewhere. In April 2005, Applicant left his employer to work for a start-up company. One year later, after the start-up company position ended, he returned to his employer. In 2008, Applicant again departed his job with his employer to establish his own business, which ended within the year. He returned to work with his employer in 2009. 1 Applicant graduated from high school. He received training in the military and on- the-job. He took some college courses, but does not have a degree. Applicant and his first wife married and divorced. He married his second wife in 1982 and they divorced in 2000. He has two children, a 24-year-old daughter and a 22-year-old son.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F\non July 20, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 28, 2009. He answered the\nSOR in writing on August 25, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative\nJanuary 29, 2010\n\nGE 1; Tr. 19, 26, 36-37.\n1\nGE 1; AE V; Tr. 18-21.\n2\n2\njudge. DOHA received the request. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on\nSeptember 18, 2009, and I received the case assignment on October 8, 2009. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on October 19, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on November 4, 2009. The government offered six exhibits (GE) 1 through 6,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf. He submitted 27 exhibits (AE) A through AA, which were received and\nadmitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on November 12, 2009. I held the record open until December 4, 2009, for\nApplicant to submit additional matters. He timely submitted AE BB through AE SS,\nwithout objection. The record closed on December 4, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on October 26, 2009. (Tr. 12.) I advised\nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the\nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Id.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the\nSOR. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant, who is 51 years old, works as a tempest engineer for a Department of\nDefense contractor. Since 1991, Applicant has worked as an engineer for his current\nemployer, except for two periods of employment elsewhere. In April 2005, Applicant left\nhis employer to work for a start-up company. One year later, after the start-up company\nposition ended, he returned to his employer. In 2008, Applicant again departed his job\nwith his employer to establish his own business, which ended within the year. He\nreturned to work with his employer in 2009.  \n1\nApplicant graduated from high school. He received training in the military and on-\nthe-job. He took some college courses, but does not have a degree. Applicant and his\nfirst wife married and divorced. He married his second wife in 1982 and they divorced in\n2000. He has two children, a 24-year-old daughter and a 22-year-old son. Applicant is\nnot married.2\nApplicant described his divorce from his second wife as \u201cmessy\u201d. They separated\nin 1998 and battled over many issues in court. The court decided on joint custody of\ntheir children, then awarded him primary physical custody of their two children, who\n\nAE S; AE V; Tr. 18-19.\n3\nGE 5; Tr. 19-10, 54-56, 82-84.\n4\nApplicant received two offers on his house: one for $50,000 and one for $80,000. Since the offers were lower\n5\nthan his mortgage, he did not accept either. Tr. 57-58.\nGE 1; Tr. 20-22, 57, 74-75.\n6\nAE A; AE Y; AE Z; AE AA; Tr. 19, 72.\n7\n3\nwere 10 and 12 at the time. The court also directed his wife to pay Applicant over $500\na month in child support, which she has not paid. His former wife owes him more than\n$28,000 in back child support. He does not anticipate receiving this money. He\naccumulated $35,000 in attorney fees during his divorce. He exhausted his savings and\n401k account to pay some of these fees. He continues to pay his attorney $100 a\nmonth, with a remaining balance of $2,700 as of October 1, 2009.3\nIn 2004, a hurricane damaged Applicant\u2019s home. His damages totaled $40,000\nand his insurance paid $24,000. He obtained a loan for $10,000 to help pay the repair\ncosts. He pays $82 a month on this loan. He has been behind occasionally on his\npayments. When he made his payment in October 2009, his loan became current. He\nindicted that the house damage and subsequent repairs had little negative impact on his\nbills, but did effect his cash flow and budgeting.  \n4\nIn 2007, he and his first wife decided to live together. She moved into his house\nwith her teenage daughter. He provided financial support, as she did not work. She did\nreceive some child support for her daughter. In 2008, they moved 200 miles from his\nhome. He did not rent his house after they moved. Instead, he placed his house for sale\nwith an asking price of $135,000, which was more than his mortgage balance of\n$98,000. He anticipated paying his debts with the money from the sale of his house. His\nhouse never sold.  In 2008, he paid his mortgage and utilities on his house as well as\n5\nthe apartment rent in his new location, for a total monthly expense of more than $2,600\na month. He and his first wife ended their relationship in early 2009, and he moved back\ninto his house. She died a few months after their relationship ended. He incurred some\nunanticipated expenses related to her death in 2009.6\nIn 1994, Applicant and his second wife filed for bankruptcy. She managed the\nhousehold finances and he did not pay attention to her fiscal management until the\nfinances were out of control. Prior to filing bankruptcy, he has experienced job changes\nwhich impacted his income negatively. The court discharged their debts under Chapter\n7 of the bankruptcy code in 1994. From 1994 through 1998, Applicant earned between\n$59,900 and $67,500 a year. In 1999, his earnings dropped to $52,800. He slowly\nincreased his earnings each year through 2004, a year he earned $67,700. In 2005, he\nworked for a started-up company, earning $25,000 in income. He returned to his former\nemployer in 2006, earning $68,000 that year. His income continues to increase. In 2007\nand 2008 he earned $118,000 including bonuses.7\n\nBecause Applicant is paid weekly, four months a year he receives five paychecks, increasing his net income\n8\nfor the four months by $1,408. His monthly expenses remain constant.\nApplicant prepared an income and expense affidavit using a family court affidavit. His gross monthly income\n9\nis based on receiving 4 and 1/3 paychecks, not four. His total monthly expenses of $3790 include $440 for\nentertainment, vacation, sports, and hobbies. These expenses are optional and not included in the monthly\nexpense shown. AE AA.\nGE 6; AE AA; Tr. 70, 75-78, 85-86.\n10\nGE 2; GE 3.\n11\nAppellant paid his required $150 co-pay on the date he received the medical services. He argued with the\n12\ninsurance company for months over the payment of the remaining balance. Tr. 27-29.\n4\nApplicant currently earns $1,923 a week in gross pay and $1,408 a week in net\npay. His net monthly income averages $5,632 (based on four paychecks).  His monthly\n8\nexpenses total $3,350.  In addition to his monthly expenses, Applicant pays $1,216 a\n9\nmonth on his past due debts, his attorney fee, and house repair loan. His remaining\nincome each month is approximately $1,000 which he uses to pay the entire bill each\nmonth on his one credit card and to pay unanticipated expenses.10\nAfter reviewing the credit report dated September 3, 2008, July 8, 2009, and the\nSOR, I have compiled a list of the total debts owed, excluding any duplicate entries. I\nfind that Appellant\u2019s actual debts are as follows:11\nSOR \u00b6\nType of Debt\nAmount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\n1994 Chapter 7\nBankruptcy\n$47,554\nDischarged\nAE A; Tr. 19\n1.b\nMedical bill\n$     237\nPaid\nAE B; Tr. 23-\n24.\n1.c\nMedical bill\n$       80\nPaid\nAE C; AE NN;\nTr. 25\n1.d\nMedical bill \n$     340\nPaid\nAE C; AE OO;\nTr. 27-29.12\n1.e\nCredit card\n$  5,939\nPayment plan, paid\n$900 as of 11/1/09,\npaying $150 a month\nAE E; AE PP;\nTr. 29\n1.f\nCredit card\n$  3,847\nPayment plan, paid\n$1,000 as of 11/1/09,\npaying $100 a month\nAE F; AE QQ;\nTr. 32\n\n5\n1.g\nCredit card\n$  2,303\nPayment plan, paid\n$600 as of 11/1/09,\npaying $75 a month\nAE G; AE RR;\nTr. 33\n1.h\nCredit card\n$  1,779\nPayment plan, paid\n$150 as of 11/1/09;\npaying $50 a month\nAE H; AE SS;\nTr. 38-39\n1.i\nCredit card debt\n$     890\nPaid\nAE I; AE DD;\nTr. 39-40\n1.j\nCredit card\n$  1,843\nPayment plan, paid\n$450 as of 11/1/09,\npaying $75 twice a\nmonth\nAE J; AE EE;\nTr. 40-41\n1.k\nCredit card\n$  4,401\nPayment plan, paying\n$157 a month for 3\nyears beginning\nOctober 22, 2009\nAE K; AE FF;\nTr. 44\n1.l\nStore account\n$     601\nPaid\nAE L; AE GG;\nTr. 45-46\n1.m\nStore account\n$     649\nPaid\nAE M; AE HH;\nTr. 46-47\n1.n\nStore account\n$     653\nPaid\nAE N; AE II; Tr.\n47-49\n1.o\nCredit card\n$     749\nPaid\nAEO; AE JJ;\nTr. 49-40\n1.p\nCredit card\n$     878\nPayment plan - $118 a\nmonth for 6 months; 3\npayments made as of\nNovember 1, 2009\nAE P; AE KK;\nTr. 50-51\n1.q\nCredit card\n$     999\nPayment plan, paying\n$134 for six months; 3\npayments made as of\nNovember 1, 2009\nAE Q; AE LL;\nTr. 51-52\n1.r\nTelephone bill\n$     269\nPaid \nAE R; AE MM;\nTr. 52\nIn late 2008, attorneys for the creditors listed in SOR allegations 1.e through 1.h\ninstituted civil actions against Applicant for payment of his debts. In each case,\nApplicant negotiated a payment plan with the attorney or through the court mediation\nprocess. He signed his first agreement on December 3, 2008 and his last agreement on\n\nAE E; AE F; AE G; AE H; AE W ; AW  X; AE PP; AE QQ; AE RR; AE SS; Tr. 29-36.\n13\nGE 4; AE Z; Tr. 78-80. \n14\nTr. 35-36, 76-77, 87-88.\n15\nGE 1; AE U.\n16\n6\nJune 26, 2009. He reached these agreements three to six months before the SOR was\nissued and has complied with the payment plans. Applicant paid two debts not listed in\nthe SOR in August and September 2009.13\nWhen Applicant filed his federal tax return for 2008 in July 2009, he owed an\nadditional $1,188 in federal taxes over and above the amount of taxes being withheld\nfrom his pay. He reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to pay $50 a\nmonth on his tax balance. He made his first payment in September 2009.14\nMost of the debts in the SOR became delinquent in late 2006 or early 2007.\nApplicant used his credit cards to pay regular bills in 2005, when he worked for the\nstart-up company. For three months during this employment, he did not receive income.\nDespite earning income in 2006 comparable to his earnings in 2004, Applicant could not\npay all his credit card debts. Applicant currently has one credit card, which he pays in\nfull each month. He is now \u201cliving on a cash basis and has done pretty well.\u201d He does\nnot plan to incur future debt and would like to sell his house in the future. His son and\ndaughter-in-law started living with him in April 2009. His son is a full-time student. His\nson and daughter-in-law had jobs in April 2009, but both later lost their jobs. His\ndaughter-in-law obtained a new job just prior to the hearing.15\nSix managers, co-workers, or friends wrote letters of recommendation on behalf\nof Applicant. All agree that he is trustworthy and recommend him for a clearance. They\ndescribe him as an expert in a highly specialized field of engineering. They praise his\nwork ethic and his ability to work with his co-workers and management. Applicant listed\nhis debts on his security clearance application.16\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n7\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n8\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was unable to\npay these obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial problems are\nlongstanding. His financial problems did not occur under unusual circumstances. This\nmitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s divorce from\nhis second wife was fought through the court system, resulting in significant attorney\nfees for him. He depleted his savings and 401k to pay these fees, but this money did\nnot pay his entire legal bill. He continues to pay his debt, nearly 10 years after his\ndivorce. His house was damaged in a 2004 hurricane and insurance paid 60% of the\ndamages. He borrowed money to pay the remaining repair cost. He continues to pay\nthis debt, although he has been late with his payments. In 2005, he changed jobs,\ntaking a new job he thought had promise, Instead, the employer lacked funds to pay\nhim, causing a loss of more than $40,000, or more than 60% in income for the year\n2005. Applicant had little choice about what he could do in these circumstances. He\nused his credit cards to pay normal expenses when he did not have income. He paid\nthe bills he could pay, including his attorney and the repair loan. This mitigating\ncondition is partially applicable.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not received financial\ncounseling. However, he has taken control of his finances and his past debts. He paid\nnine small debts listed in the SOR and he has payments plans in place for the eight\nremaining SOR debts. Two payment plans will be completed by March 1, 2010. In\naddition, Applicant developed a payment plan with the IRS, as soon as he received\nnotice from the IRS about his known tax deficit. He pays his other bills as required.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are under control, and his past debts are paid or being\nresolved through payment plans. \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant did\nnot initiate a good-faith effort to repay his bills. He developed four payment plans when\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) does not apply in this case.\n17\n9\npresented with court action. He paid his small bills or developed repayment plans for\nthree other debts after he received the SOR. I conclude this mitigating condition does\nnot apply.17\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching this conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems began during his second marriage. He and his second wife filed a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 1994 when their debts became unmanageable\nfollowing income loss and poor fiscal management. The court discharged their debts on\nJuly 11, 1994. When he and his second wife separated and divorced, Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems continued as he provided sole support for his children and incurred\nsignificant attorney fees to end his marriage. A hurricane and underemployment created\nnew financial issues for Applicant. He paid his bills for a time, but in late 2006 he began\nto fall behind. He has not clearly explained how this happened. However, when his\nincome was reduced by more than 60% in 2005, his ability to pay his living expenses\n\n10\nwas severely impacted. Once he returned to work at a decent salary, he could pay his\nregular expenses, but not all his past debts too. The loss of significant income creates\nfinancial problems which takes many months or years to resolve.\nIn 2007, Applicant and his first wife decided they would try living together again.\nHe assumed financial responsibility for her and to some level her daughter. Even\nthough his income began to increase in 2007, the additional cost of supporting two other\nindividuals limited the availability of his resources to pay his old debts. During this time,\nhe did not incur more outstanding debts. When they moved 200 miles away from his\nhome, he decided to sell his home, a sensible decision. Unfortunately, the real estate\nmarket changed drastically and he could not sell his house. He continued to pay the\nmortgage and utilities on his house as well as the rent on the apartment in which they\nlived. After paying housing costs for both properties and the normal everyday costs of\nliving, such as food, gasoline, clothing, insurance and repairs, Applicant lacked sufficient\nincome to pay his old debts. Their living arrangement ended in early 2009, and he\nreturned to his house, which eliminated the second housing expense. The money he\nspent on rent is now being used to pay his debts. His slowness in moving forward with\npaying his old debts relates to his finances, which are now much better than three years\nago. He has always acknowledged the debts and his much improved financial position\nenables him to pay his past debts. Through his recent efforts, he resolved his smaller\ndebts by paying the debts, and he resolved his larger debts through payment plans. He\nhas complied with the payment terms of six plans. Because he complies with these\nplans, I infer that he will also comply with his most recent payment plans. Applicant has\ntaken control of his finances and his debts. He is financially stable and lives within his\nfinancial means. As he said, he is doing well living on a cash basis.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances under\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.r:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has mitigated security concerns pertaining to Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 24, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On August 31, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) for Applicant. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nMarch 30, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 24, 2009, which DOHA \nreceived on September 25, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nOctober 9, 2009. The case was assigned to me on October 20, 2009. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on October 20, 2009, scheduling the hearing for November 18, 2009. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through I, \nwhich were received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open until December 4, 2009, to afford the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional documents on his behalf. Applicant timely submitted \nAE J through P, which were received without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on November 25, 2009. The record closed on December 4, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a. with explanation, and he \ndenied the remaining allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.f. with explanations. His \nanswers with explanations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough \nreview of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old electronic technician, who has worked for his defense \ncontractor employer since September 2008. GE 1, Tr.13-14. He is applying for a \nsecurity clearance, which is a requirement for his continued employment. Tr. 14-15.  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 2003. He briefly attended college \nfrom October 2003 to January 2004 before entering the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, \ndiscussed below. Applicant is currently working towards an on-line associate\u2019s degree. \nGE 1, Tr. 15-16. He married in August 2007. Applicant and his wife have a two-year-\nold son. GE 1, Tr. 16-18, 27-28. His wife works full-time in the circulation department \nof the local newspaper and earns $7.50 per hour. Tr. 67. \n \nApplicant was adopted at age five. His adopted father was previously married \nto his biological mother, and is a prominent member of his community. After Applicant \nleft home, he took in his younger half-brother who was in his sophomore year of high \nschool. At the time Applicant took in his younger brother, he was living with their \nbiological mother in Mexico and she was \u201cup to no good.\u201d He subsequently raised and \nsupported his younger brother until he became of age. Tr. 32-35. Applicant has no \ncontact with his mother, who is currently serving a 15-year sentence for drug \ntrafficking. Tr. 77. \n \nApplicant served in the Marine Corps Reserve from February 2004 to April \n2008, where he earned a Military Occupational Specialty of 3521 (automotive \n\n \n3 \n \n \norganizational mechanic), and achieved the rank of Lance Corporal (pay grade E-3). \nGE 1, Tr. 18-27.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his September 2008 e-QIP; his May 2009 Responses to DOHA \nFinancial Interrogatories; and his October 2008, August 2009, October 2009, and \nNovember 2009 credit reports. GE 1 \u2013 7.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified six separate debts \u2013 four collection accounts, one \ncharged off account, and one repossession, approximating $15,757. Tr. 10-11. \n \nApplicant has settled, paid or successfully disputed the six debts alleged. A \nbrief summary of each debt follows. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. is a collection \naccount in the amount of $167 on behalf of a telephone company. Applicant settled \nand paid this account for $91.60. AE C, AE L, Tr. 35-38. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b is a collection account on behalf a physician for medical services received in the \namount of $138. Applicant settled and paid this account for $122. AE C, AE M, AE O, \nTr. 38-40. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. is a collection account on behalf of a cell \nphone company in the amount of $459. Applicant settled and paid this account for \n$240. AE C, AE O, AE P, Tr. 40-41. \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. is a charged off account on behalf of a former \nlandlord in the amount of $185. Applicant paid this account in full. AE A, AE D,  \nAE K, AE N, Tr. 41-44, AE E. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. is a collection account \nfor a vehicle repossession in the amount of $14,644. Applicant successfully disputed \nthis debt and the debt has been removed from his credit reports. AE K, AE O, Tr. 46-\n50. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. is a collection account for medical services \nprovided to Applicant\u2019s half-brother in the amount of $164. Applicant paid this account \nin full. AE C \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his youth, financial inexperience, \nand lack of resources, or as he explained: \n \n. . . just me being a dumb person, I guess, dumb kid. I don\u2019t know how to \nput it. I was \u2013 most of \u2018em are from when I was young and just didn\u2019t \nhave the money to pay anything and I just \u2013 a lot of the little ones are \nmedical bills and I raised my little brother from when I was 21 or 22 till he \ngraduated high school \u2018cause he was living in Mexico and he had \nmedical bills, and I just couldn\u2019t afford a lot of things. I was only making \nnine or ten bucks an hour and I couldn\u2019t afford nothing with my \u2013 I was \nstill with my wife \u2013 well, it wasn\u2019t my wife yet, but she lived with me. Tr. \n32 \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant sought financial counseling from a financial advisor. His advisor \nassisted him in developing a comprehensive financial strategy that includes a viable \nbudget that will allow Applicant to live within his means. AE A, Tr. 44-45, 65-66. In \nconclusion, Applicant has paid, settled, made good-faith efforts to repay overdue \ncreditors, or resolved all debts alleged. His monthly budget reflects a net remainder of \n$992.  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant provided reference letters from his adopted father, a long-time \npersonal friend, and a former employer and personal friend. AE F \u2013 H. His adopted \nfather went into detail describing Applicant\u2019s upbringing and challenges he has faced. \nAll reference letters describe Applicant as a hard worker, who is honest, dedicated \nand dependable. AE F \u2013 H. \n \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s adopted father testified on his behalf. He stated that he \nwas previously married to Applicant\u2019s biological mother. When he divorced Applicant\u2019s \nmother, Applicant chose to move in with him. Applicant\u2019s adopted father has been in \nradio and television for 51 years with an emphasis on agriculture. He described \nApplicant as a \u201ctough player\u201d in soccer and football. Applicant\u2019s adopted father also \nhas ten children; however, his oldest child passed away in 2008. He described the \nApplicant as trustworthy and dependable. Tr. 88-93. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial \nproblems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is established by his admissions and evidence \npresented. As indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. to 1.f., he had six delinquent debts totaling \nabout $15,757 that have been in various states of delinquency. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebt. Because there is more than one delinquent debt, his financial problems are not \nisolated. The debts were not paid until 2010, and therefore his debt is \u201ca continuing \ncourse of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. \n16, 2002)). He receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because the debt \u201coccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 20(b), \nhe receives partial mitigation because of his underemployment and challenging family \nsituation. However, he did not provide sufficient information to establish that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances.1  \n \n1\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. \n99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A \ncomponent is whether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep his debts current. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable because there is evidence of financial counseling. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is sufficient to show not only evidence of counseling, but also \nthat his financial problems are resolved and under control. There is also sufficient \ninformation to establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d)2 and 20(e). Applicant has \nsettled or paid all of his debts except the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e., which he successfully \ndisputed. He understands the security implications of delinquent debt and will \nscrupulously avoid future delinquent debt. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. The SOR lists six \ndebts totalling $15,757 that were at one time or another in various states of \ndelinquency. He failed to keep his accounts current and negotiate lesser payments, \n \n \n2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive \ndoes not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nshowing some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His lack of success \nresolving delinquent debt raises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant\u2019s record of military service and good employment weighs in his favor. He is \na law-abiding citizen. His debts are current and his SOR debts are all paid or resolved. \nHis monthly expenses are current. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in \nthe whole person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019\u201d necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant \nis not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for \nthe payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a \nreasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \nApplicant is making a contribution to the national defense. His family and friends fully \nsupport him and recommend him for a security clearance. He made mistakes, and \ndebts became delinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. He \nhas paid his debts. Furthermore, he has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of \ndebt payments. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.f.: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nRobert J. Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 35-year-old-electrician for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant 1 Under Smith Amendment prohibitions (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986), Applicant\u2019s sentence and prison time served would have subjected him to the Amendment\u2019s per se clearance bar. The Smith Amendment was repealed, however, in January 2008 by the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008 and replaced by Sec. 3002 to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435b (the Bond Amendment), which applies throughout the Federal government.

Lieske, Jr., Personal Representative\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\n Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude that\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding his finances, alcohol issues,\ncriminal conduct, and personal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied. \nStatement of Case\nOn July 16, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nDOHA recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006. \nApril 11, 2011\n\n2\nApplicant responded to the SOR in July 2010 (undated) and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on October 18, 2010.  It was scheduled for hearing on\nNovember 18, 2010. A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, or deny Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance. At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of nine exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nand eight exhibits (AE A-H). The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 30, 2010. \nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR\nto add a falsification allegation (omission of recent drug use) under Guideline E to\nconform to the evidence.  For good cause demonstrated, Department Counsel\u2019s motion\nwas granted.  Applicant denied any attempt to falsify his security clearance application.\nDepartment Counsel was granted seven days to file a written brief concerning the\napplication of the Bond Amendment to the developed facts of the case. Applicant was\nafforded seven days to respond. Post-hearing briefs were not filed by either party. \nPrior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of a Chapter 7 protection petition.  For good cause shown,\nApplicant was granted seven days to supplement the record. Within the time permitted,\nApplicant supplemented the record with a clerk notice of Appellant\u2019s bankruptcy case\nfiling on October 31, 2010. The notice reflects an actual bankruptcy case filing by\nApplicant, but contains no copy of Applicant\u2019s petition or additional bankruptcy\nschedules. The notice is admitted as AE E.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 35 debts exceeding\n$106,000.  Under Guideline G, he allegedly was (a) arrested and charged in November\n2001 with DUI, convicted of the same offense (later amended to reckless driving), fined,\nand ordered to attend driving school and perform community service and (b) arrested in\nMay 2009 and charged with DUI and reckless driving, fined, and ordered to serve two\ndays in jail, attend a victim impact panel; and complete a course in alcohol abuse. And\nunder Guideline J, he allegedly was charged with various offenses (six in all, inclusive of\nhis two alcohol-related offenses) between 1994 and 2009.\nIn his undated response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the specific\nallegations. But he denied that his actions reflect poor judgment, unreliability, and\nuntrustworthiness, or call into question his willingness or ability to properly protect\nclassified information and other protected information.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old-electrician for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\n\n1   Under Smith Amendment prohibitions (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986), Applicant\u2019s sentence and prison time served would have\nsubjected him to the Amendment\u2019s per se  clearance bar.  The Smith Amendment was repealed, however, in January\n2008 by the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008 and replaced by Sec. 3002 to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435b (the\nBond Amendment), which applies throughout the Federal government.  Sec. 3002(c) of this new provision continues the\nrequirement for disqualification, absent a meritorious waiver, for persons who were sentenced to and served imprisonment\nfor more than a year.  However, this disqualification only applies to prevent clearances that would provide access to\n3\nare incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional\nfindings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant married in December 1996 and separated shortly thereafter. (GE 1) He\nhas four children from this marriage. He remarried in 2010 and has a six-month\ndaughter from this marriage. (Tr. 84)  His 16-year-old daughter, a granddaughter, and\none of his sons from his previous relationship/marriage reside with him and his wife. (Tr.\n65, 82-84) His two other sons  reside with their mother. (Tr. 65, 83)  \nRecords document that Applicant attended high school between 1990 and 2002\nand received his high school diploma in 2002. (GE 1) Since May 2008, he has taken\ntrade school courses. (GE 1)\nApplicant has worked for his current employer for the past two and one-half\nyears. (GE 1; Tr. 66) Before joining his current employer, he worked for a variety of\nemployers.  He was out of work due to a non-work related accident disability in 2003. \nHe was unemployed with another non-work accident-related disability in 2006. (Tr. 67-\n68) \nApplicant\u2019s arrest history\nApplicant was just 17 years of age when he first tried marijuana. (Tr. 63, 75-76)\nHis then girlfriend introduced him to methamphetamine (speed). (Tr. 63, 76)  In 1994,\nhe was arrested and charged with two counts of possession of marijuana (a controlled\nsubstance) with intent to sell and one count of possession of a controlled substance (a\nfelony). Applicant pled guilty to one count of possession of a Schedule I controlled\nsubstance (a felony), and was sentenced to two years in prison (all but six months\nsuspended) and  placed on two years of probation. (Tr. 111) \nDuring the six months he served in a prison boot camp, he participated in the\nfacility\u2019s 12-step program. (Tr. 124-125) Once he was released from prison in 1996, he\nreturned to smoking marijuana. (Tr. 112, 124-126)  In September 1996, Applicant was\narrested for probation violation after he was found in possession of marijuana by\narresting officers. (GE 9; Tr. 125) When he appeared for his hearing, the court revoked\nhis probation and ordered that he complete the two-year sentence he was ordered to\nserve in 1994. (GEs 7 and 9; Tr. 111) The court credited him with pre-sentence\nincarceration, and he thereafter served a total of 13 months of his prison sentence\nbefore he was released in early 1998.  See GE 9; Tr. 111, 126-131.1\n\nspecial access programs (SAP, restricted date (RD), or any other information commonly referred to as \u201cspecial\ncompartmented information\u201d (SCI).  \n4\nApplicant continued to use marijuana following the completion of his prison\nsentence in 1998. (Tr. 70-76). He last used marijuana in 2006.  (Tr. 70-78) He attributes\nhis marijuana use to poor choices. Although he no longer uses marijuana, he continues\nto associate with friends who do use the drug. (Tr. 78) \nIn September 1996, Applicant was arrested for domestic violence following his\ngirlfriend\u2019s filing of a police report that he struck her. (Tr.  58, 112) Applicant denied the\ncharges, and they were ultimately dismissed. (Tr. 58, 81, 132-133)  In May 1997,\nApplicant was arrested for domestic battery. His middle-son\u2019s mother attempted to stab\nhim during their argument. (Tr. 58, 113-114) She then called the police who responded\nand arrested Applicant. (Tr. 12) Applicant denied these 1997 battery charges, and they,\ntoo, were dismissed. (Tr. 112, 132-133)    \nWhile in high school, Applicant was also introduced to alcohol. He continued to\nconsume alcohol throughout his high school years and usually consumed two to four\nbeers at a time, but occasionally he consumed as much as a six-pack in a day during\nfishing events. (Tr. 137-138)  During his time in boot camp and prison (1996-1997), he\nparticipated in 12-step alcohol programs organized by prison administrators. (Tr. 137)\nBut once he completed his prison term, he ceased his 12-step participation and\nreturned to consuming alcohol. (Tr. 64, 137-138)\nIn November 2001, he was arrested and charged with DUI and reckless driving\nafter registering a .12 blood alcohol content (BAC) on the breathalyzer that the arresting\nofficer administered at the scene. (Tr. 102)  Before his arrest, he had consumed a few\nshots of whiskey and beers with friends at a local bar, and had become intoxicated. (Tr.\n104) He was subsequently convicted of DUI, fined, and ordered to attend driving school\nand perform community services. However, the court did not impose any counseling\nservices. (Tr. 106) And Applicant did not initiate any alcohol counseling on his own after\nhe completed his court-ordered conditions. After completing his court-imposed\nconditions, Applicant returned to drinking. (Tr. 106) \nIn May 2009, Applicant attended a chili cookout and consumed several alcoholic\nbeverages before driving himself to a local ATM site for additional cash. (Tr. 106-107).\nWhile in transit, he was stopped by police and administered a field sobriety test. (Tr.\n107-108)  After being tested by a breathalyzer and registering a .08 BAC on this test\n(Tr. 108), he was arrested for DUI. (Tr. 109) At his scheduled hearing, Applicant pled\nguilty to a DUI charge and was fined and ordered by the court to serve two days in jail,\nattend a victim impact pane,l and complete an alcohol abuse course. (GEs 7 and 9;\nTr.109-110) The court, in turn, reduced the DUI charges to reckless driving. (GEs 7 and\n9; Tr. 62) \nApplicant\u2019s court-ordered alcohol abuse course did not include a 12-step\nprogram. He completed the course prescribed for him and was credited by the court\n\n5\nwith successful completion. (GEs 7 and 9)  He has never sought or received additional\ncounseling and has never been diagnosed with alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse by\nany certified substance abuse professional. (Tr. 137-138) While he believes he had an\nalcohol problem when he was younger (potentially an alcoholic), he does not believe he\nhas one now. (Tr. 110, 134)\nFinances\nWhile he was out of work in 2003 and 2006, Applicant accumulated a number of\ndelinquent debts. His credit reports reveal 35 debts exceeding $106,000. (GEs C\nthrough F) A number of the listed debts are medically-related to a motorcycle accident\nhe was involved in 2003. (Tr. 53-54) In the crash he shattered his knee and was\ndisabled for six to seven months in 2003. (Tr. 67) Because he had no medical insurance\nat the time, he incurred major medical expenses.  \nIn September 2006, Applicant was involved in another accident. He lost control of\nhis truck when he encountered rainy conditions and was thrown from his vehicle. (Tr.\n54-55) He had no insurance to cover him in this accident either, and once again\nincurred major medical expenses. (AE B)  As a result of this accident, he was out of\nwork for over 12 months with a medical disability. (AE D; Tr. 55)  \nMany of the delinquent accounts listed in Applicant\u2019s credit reports represent\nmedical bills associated with his 2003 and 2006 accidents. Some comprise credit card,\nauto loan, and utility accounts. Unable to address these debts with his limited income,\nhe consulted a bankruptcy attorney in 2010. (AE A) The proposed schedule of\nunsecured, non-priority claims that he attached to a bankruptcy clerk\u2019s notice of a\nChapter 7 petition filed by Applicant in October 2010 contains claims approximating\n$119,000 and includes all of the listed claims in the SOR. (AE A)  Missing from AE A\nare  Applicant\u2019s other bankruptcy schedules (e.g., his schedules containing secured\nclaims, his real and personal assets, his exemptions, and his current income and\nexpenses) and his verification of financial counseling. Verified financial counseling is a\nprerequisite to any approved bankruptcy petition. \nIn his post-hearing submission, Applicant documented filing his Chapter 7 petition\nin October 2010. (AE E). He did not provide evidence of the actual petition, any of his\nother bankruptcy schedules, or evidence of required financial counseling. Whether\nApplicant ever obtained his bankruptcy discharge is unknown at this time.   \nApplicant currently nets about $2,977 a month. (GE 2; Tr. 92) Since completing\nhis last personal financial statement, he listed has monthly expenses of $1,678,\nmonthly debts of $1,229, and a net monthly remainder of $69 in his 2009 personal\nfinancial statement. (GE 2)  \nSince completing his 2009 financial statement, his income has for the most part\nremained constant; while his expenses and debts have risen. (Tr. 92-98) He currently\nreports monthly expenses of around $2,600 a month (Tr. 96-99), an increase of over\n\n6\n$900 over what he reported in 2009. His financial obligations have also increased this\npast year. By paying off his listed motorcycle and Mustang vehicle, he saves himself\naround $675 a month.  (Tr. 98-100)  At the same time, he has added more debt from his\nrecent purchase of a new $30,000 pick-up in his mother\u2019s name ($662 a month) for his\nwife to drive. (Tr. 94-95) Insurance costs associated with his added vehicle approximate\n$100 a month. (Tr. 96)  This leaves him with virtually no remainder for most months. (Tr.\n100-101) \nApplicant has no 401(k) retirement account and virtually no savings. (Tr. 100)  He\noffered no concrete plans for avoiding recurrent financial setbacks in the foreseeable\nfuture.  \nE-QIP omissions\nAsked to complete a security clearance application (E-QIP) in July 2008,\nApplicant omitted his most recent use of marijuana in 2006. (GE 1) Applicant attributed\nhis omissions to oversight but provided no further details. (Tr. 71-77) When\nsubsequently interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM), Applicant failed to correct his omission or apprise the investigator of any\nmarijuana use since 1996. (Tr. 78-80)  \nWhether Applicant\u2019s return to marijuana use in 2006 represented one isolated\nincident or part of a recurrent pattern is unclear and warrants no adverse inferences.\nBut considering his historical involvement in illegal drugs and his failure to mention his\n2006 marijuana use in both his e-QIP and his ensuing OPM interview, his omissions\nraise  too many doubts about his willingness to discuss his recent drug use to treat them\nas unintentional. \nWithout more probative explanations from Applicant about his more recent drug\nuse omissions, there is not enough evidentiary support to accept Applicant\u2019s claims that\nhis drug use omissions were inadvertent. Considering all of the circumstances\nsurrounding his drug use omissions in his e-QIP and ensuing OPM interview, inferences\nwarrant that they were knowingly and wilfully made.   \nEndorsements\nA coworker and friend described Applicant as honest and responsible. (AE C)\nThis coworker extolled Applicant\u2019s displayed work ethic and judgment and characterized\nhim as an asset to his organization. (AE C) Based only on his letter, it cannot be\ndetermined whether this coworker is aware of the Government\u2019s concerns. \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in deciding DOHA\ncases. These guidelines take into account factors that could create a potential conflict of\ninterest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations that could affect the\n\n7\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. These\nguidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and any of the \"[c]onditions that could\nmitigate security concerns.\u201d They must be considered before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, revoked, or denied. The guidelines do\nnot require administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of\nthe guidelines is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with\nAG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(c) factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.  AG \u00b6 18.\n\n8\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nAG \u00b6 21.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.  AG \u00b6 30.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nA decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made\nonly upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest. Because the Directive requires administrative judges to make a common-\nsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination\nof an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the\njudge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from\nthe evidence of record.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance. The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\n\n9\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a respected employee of a defense contractor who accumulated a\nnumber of delinquent debts during periods of disability and unemployment that\nfollowed two serious vehicle accidents.  Unable to resolve his accumulation of\ndelinquent debts, he recently petitioned for Chapter 7 protection. Final discharge is\nuncertain. \nBesides raised initial security concerns over Applicant\u2019s finances, concerns are\nalso raised over his recurrent history of criminal arrests and dispositions that includes\nboth drug-related and alcohol-related offenses. Applicant\u2019s omissions of his more\nrecent marijuana use are also raised as a security concern. \nFinancial concerns\nApplicant\u2019s accumulated debt delinquencies warrant the application of two of\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guideline: DC \u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b619(c) \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily impose important duties of trust\nand candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those typically\nimposed on government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\ngovernment business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).\nFailure of the applicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve his debts when\nable to do so raises security-significant concerns about the sufficiency of the\napplicant\u2019s demonstrated trust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified\ninformation.\nAddressing his listed debts, Applicant provided limited evidence of any\nrepayment efforts but instead relied on his recently filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition\nto resolve his debts. Many of his scheduled debts do encompass medically-related\ndebts associated with his two road accidents. Other listed debts involve car loans and\nconsumer accounts that are attributable in part to his extended periods of disability in\n2003 and 2006, but also to some indicia of living beyond his means. A full evaluation\nof Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition is complicated, though, by the absence of\ncounseling verification and many of the important schedules that comprise his petition.\nWithout the complete Chapter 7 filing to examine and evaluate, educated\nassessments about his prospects for a successful discharge of his considerable debt\n(over $119.000) cannot be made at this time. \n\n10\nBased on his evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are sufficient to establish\nconsiderable extenuating circumstances associated with many of his debt\naccumulations. His circumstances include recurrent periods of unemployment and\nnon-work-related disabilities. As a result, MC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations\nguideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly),\u201d\napplies to Applicant\u2019s circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to address his delinquent debts during the more than two\nyears he has worked for his current employer and his recent resort to the use of\nfederal bankruptcy protections to resolve his substantial delinquent debt are too\nbelated, incomplete, and uncertain to entitle him  to mitigation credit under MC \u00b6\n20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\u201d Neither this mitigating condition nor any of the other\npotentially available ones have application to Applicant\u2019s situation, considering the\nrecency and incompleteness of his petition and the uncertainty of success that\nsurrounds his petition at this time. \nTo Applicant\u2019s credit, he has recognized the seriousness of his current financial\nsituation since his receipt of the SOR and has taken legal measures to resolve his\ndebts through the federal bankruptcy laws. But it is still too soon to make any safe\npredictions on his obtaining a bankruptcy discharge and near and long-term prospects\nfor restoring control of his finances. At this time, Applicant is not able to demonstrate\nthat he is firmly in control of his finances and can be expected to stay current with his\ndebts.\nBased on a whole-person assessment, Applicant fails to surmount the\njudgment questions raised by his accumulation of substantial delinquent debts. His\npositive endorsement from his coworker praise merits commendation, but is not\nenough to overcome doubts about his financial judgment and ability to restore his\nfinances to manageable levels. \nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources he has had to work with since\nhis two accidents, his recurrent periods of unemployment and disability, and the recent\nefforts he has mounted to seek bankruptcy protection, more time is needed to\ndetermine whether Applicant can successfully obtain a bankruptcy discharge and\nrestore his finances to stable levels commensurate with his holding a security\nclearance. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.kk. \nCriminal conduct and alcohol concerns\nApplicant\u2019s history of arrests and convictions over a 15-year period (two\nalcohol-related, two drug-related, and two that involved domestic violence and battery\n\n11\narrests) raise important security concerns about his risk of recurrent arrests and\ncharges associated with alcohol and drug abuse, and to a lesser extent with potential\ndomestic violence. On the strength of the evidence presented in connection with his\ntwo alcohol-related arrests and convictions, one disqualifying condition (DC) of the AG\nfor alcohol consumption (AG \u00b6 21) may be applied: DC \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related\nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d \nBecause all of Applicant\u2019s arrests are classed as criminal offenses, they are\ncovered by DC \u00b6 31(a) of the criminal conduct guideline as well: \u201ca single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d This disqualifying condition applies to all of\nApplicant\u2019s listed arrests and convictions.  \nDespite the seriousness of his two alcohol-related arrests, Applicant does not\nbelieve he is alcoholic and assures he only occasionally consumes alcohol since his\n2009 alcohol-related arrest. Without any demonstrated post-DUI abstinence,\nApplicant\u2019s assurances cannot be reliably gauged and evaluated.\nBased on the historical pattern of cited arrests for drugs and alcohol, evidence\nof counseling and other remedial steps (such as continued 12-step participation and\nself-enforced abstinence) could be reasonably expected of Applicant and fully\nwarranted. Active mitigating steps are lacking, though, in Applicant\u2019s proofs, and not\nenough time has passed to consider his alcohol and drug-related offenses aged and\nisolated.  As a result, neither MC \u00b6 22(a), \u201c so much time has passed, or the behavior\nwas so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current  reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment,\u201d of the alcohol guideline nor MC \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d of the criminal conduct guideline can be\napplied to Applicant\u2019s circumstances at this time. \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s domestic violence and domestic battery charges were\nall dismissed without any admitted wrongdoing. As such, the domestic violence\ncharges filed against Applicant in 1996, and the domestic battery charges filed against\nhim in 1997, are concluded to be unproven. \nTaking into account Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol and drug-related arrests and\nconvictions, and the recency of his last DUI offense in 2009, the applicable guidelines,\nand a whole-person assessment of his recurrent history of alcohol consumption and\narrests/convictions involving drugs and alcohol, conclusions warrant that his overall\nefforts reflect insufficient evidence of sustained commitment to counseling, 12-step\nparticipation or comparable alcohol-support group to ensure that he is not at any risk\nof recurrent alcohol or other substance-related arrests in the foreseeable future.\nApplicant\u2019s mitigation efforts are not enough to warrant safe predictions that he is no\n\n12\nlonger at risk to judgment impairment associated with alcohol abuse and arrests and\nconvictions related to drugs and alcohol. \nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b of the alcohol guideline of the SOR and subparagraphs\n3.a, 3.b, and 3.e of the criminal conduct guideline.  Favorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to subparagraphs 3.c and 3.d of the criminal conduct guideline.  \nPersonal Conduct issues associated with Applicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions\nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are\nraised under Guideline E as the result of his determined knowing and willful omissions\nof his use of marijuana in 2006 and before.  By omitting his  use of illegal drugs during\nthe listed period of inquiry in his questionnaire, Applicant failed to furnish materially\nimportant background information about his drug use that was needed for the\nGovernment to properly process and evaluate his security clearance application. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s omissions of his marijuana use are determined to be\nknowing and willful based on the evidence presented at hearing, one disqualifying\ncondition of the personal conduct guideline is applicable: DC \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s omissions were insufficiently explained in his hearing testimony.\nAnd when he was later interviewed by an OPM agent, he failed to make his prior drug\nuse in 2006 and before known to the investigating agent. His omissions reflect his\nconscious decisions to omit material information concerning his past marijuana\ninvolvement.     \nIn evaluating all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions,\nhis failure to correct his omissions when afforded an opportunity in his ensuing OPM\ninterview, and his hearing explanations, his proofs are insufficient to enable him to\nconvincingly refute or mitigate the deliberate falsification allegations. Questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations reflect core policy security concerns of the personal conduct guideline (AG\n\u00b6 15). \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate omissions of his past marijuana use are clearly evident\nunder the facts and policy considerations developed under this Guideline. Overall,\nApplicant\u2019s explanations of his omissions and misrepresentations are not persuasive\nenough to warrant favorable conclusions relative to the falsification allegations\npertaining to his e-QIP drug-use omissions and failure to make necessary corrections\nwhen interviewed by an OPM agent in his follow-up interview.    \n\n13\nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following\nseparate formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):       AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.kk :\n          Against Applicant\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSIDERATIONS):        AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):           \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a, 3.b, and 3.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 3.c and 3.d:\nFor Applicant\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all 15 factual allegations in the SOR. His admissions are incorporated here as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 38-year-old physical security guard working for a government contractor. He requires a security clearance to continue his job. He attended college from 1989 until 1993, but is four classes short of a degree. He paid for his college education with student loans. He has been married for 11 years, and has three stepchildren and one grandchild. Applicant employment history shows that he was employed from May 2001 until September 2004; unemployed from September 2004 until July 2005; part-time employed (underemployed) from July 2005 until April 2006; employed from April 2006 until February 2008; unemployed from February 2008 until July 2008; and employed by his current employer, a government contractor, from July 2008 until around July 2010. He received an interim security clearance shortly after he was hired. His interim security clearance was withdrawn as a result of the pending SOR, and he was suspended from his employment.

Laverdiere, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Sheila Lucas, Personal Representative \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are the result of circumstances beyond his control. \nHe understands the importance of maintaining financial responsibility and what it is \nexpected of him to be eligible for a security clearance. He did not engage in \nquestionable behavior in the acquisition of his debts. Given his circumstances, he has \nmade reasonable efforts to resolve his financial problems, and given the opportunity, he \nwill establish full financial responsibility. On balance, Applicant\u2019s current financial \nproblems do not cast doubts on his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 23, 2008. After \nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \nDecember 6, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \naffirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \n \nOn June 4, 2010, DOHA issued Applicant an SOR, which specified the basis for \nits decision -- security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) of the adjudicative guidelines (AG).2  \n \nOn July 10, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 20, \n2010, to determine whether a clearance should be granted or denied. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on August 26, 2010. The hearing was convened as scheduled on \nSeptember 15, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant and two witnesses testified, and he presented \nExhibits (AE) 1 through 8, which were admitted without objection. I kept the record open \nallowing Applicant an additional period to submit documentary evidence. He timely \nsubmitted AE 9, which was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on September 21, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all 15 factual allegations in the SOR. His admissions are \nincorporated here as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, \nand having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old physical security guard working for a government \ncontractor. He requires a security clearance to continue his job. He attended college \nfrom 1989 until 1993, but is four classes short of a degree. He paid for his college \neducation with student loans. He has been married for 11 years, and has three \nstepchildren and one grandchild. \n \nApplicant employment history shows that he was employed from May 2001 until \nSeptember 2004; unemployed from September 2004 until July 2005; part-time \nemployed (underemployed) from July 2005 until April 2006; employed from April 2006 \nuntil February 2008; unemployed from February 2008 until July 2008; and employed by \nhis current employer, a government contractor, from July 2008 until around July 2010. \nHe received an interim security clearance shortly after he was hired. His interim security \nclearance was withdrawn as a result of the pending SOR, and he was suspended from \nhis employment. He has been working on a limited part-time basis for his current \nemployer pending the resolution of his security clearance. This is his first time applying \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended; and Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as revised. \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the AGs, implemented by the DoD on September 1, \n2006. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfor a security clearance. There is no evidence that he has compromised or caused \nothers to compromise classified information, or that he has been involved in any \nsecurity violations. \n \nIn his July 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed he had \nfinancial problems. His background investigation revealed, and Applicant admitted, the \n15 delinquent or charged-off debts alleged in the SOR, totaling approximately $42,000. \nApplicant explained that he and his wife were providing financial support to two of his \nstepchildren and a grandchild. His then 15-year-old stepdaughter had a child out of \nwedlock eight years ago, and they have been living with Applicant and his wife until \nrecently. Additionally, Applicant and his wife were providing financial support to another \nstepchild who is attending college. When he and his wife were both working, they were \nin a tight budget, but they were able to pay for their family\u2019s day-to-day living expenses \nand to pay their debts. When Applicant was unemployed, they had trouble making ends \nmeet with his wife\u2019s income, his unemployment benefits, and his sporadic income from \nodd jobs. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was employed full time from May 1994 until around April 2007, \nwhen she broke her foot and had to go into short-term disability, earning only 60% \n($19,200 a year) of her regular pay ($32,000 a year). From September 2007 until \nDecember 2009, her employer placed her on a part-time schedule because of the \nemployer\u2019s financial situation, and in December 2009, she was let go from her position \nbecause of a reduction in force. Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s periods of unemployment \nmade it almost financially impossible for them to pay their family\u2019s day-to-day living \nexpenses and their debts.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $1,886 judgment filed against Applicant for his failure to pay \nhis homeowner association fees. Applicant acknowledged the debt, and testified he had \nnot been able to pay the debt because of his precarious financial situation. In \nSeptember 2010, he sent a letter to the creditor stating he was currently unemployed, \nbut that he wanted to establish a payment plan to resolve the debt. (AE 4) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \n($593), 1.e ($112), and 1.k ($527) were settled and paid by Applicant in September \n2010. (AE 9) \n \nConcerning the three alleged delinquent medical accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($191), \n1.d ($208), and 1.o ($155)), Applicant initially admitted them as his debts in his answer \nto the SOR. However, he later realized he could not identify the medical provider and \ncould not determine whether these were his or his wife\u2019s medical debts. In September \n2010, he sent written disputes to the three credit bureaus of the accounts and requested \nconfirmation that these were his debts. At the same time, Applicant also disputed the \ndelinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($2,008), 1.g ($500), 1.h ($1,805), 1.i ($555), \nand 1.j ($888), which he had admitted in his answer to the SOR. As of his hearing, he \nhad not received a response concerning these accounts. \n \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 1.l, Applicant testified that he and his wife purchased a home \nin 2002 for around $175,000. Because of their unemployment situation, they fell behind \n\n \n4 \n \n \non the mortgage payments and the account became delinquent for $12,606 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). \nApplicant remained in contact with his mortgage creditor and informed the bank of his \nfinancial problems. In June 2010, Applicant established a new mortgage payment \narrangement agreeing to pay $1,240 a month for four months, and then to make a lump \nsum payment to bring the account current. Applicant made the first two payments on his \nplan, and intended to comply with the third payment after the hearing. (AE 6) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges a student loan in collection for around $14,000. Applicant \nacknowledged the debt, and testified he had not been able to pay it because of his \nfinancial situation. He presented documentary evidence showing that in the past, when \nhe was financially able, he made some payments on his student loan. AE 9 shows $100 \npayments made in January 2002, May 2003, and June 2003. Additionally, a 2005 \nDepartment of Education statement shows he paid $715 towards accrued interest. And, \nin 2005, the U.S. Treasury Department offset $1,785 from his income tax refund and \napplied it to his student loan debt. In September 2010, Applicant sent a letter to the \nDepartment of Education requesting to establish a new payment schedule. (AE 5)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n alleges a delinquent car loan for $1,046. In 2007, Applicant purchased \na 2003 car for around $23,000. He became delinquent on his $16,000 note in 2009-\n2010. Around June 2010, he sent a letter to the creditor explaining his financial situation \nand established a new payment plan. He made payments in July and August 2010 in \ncompliance with his new loan rehabilitation payment plan. (AE 7) \n \nApplicant\u2019s pastor and his wife testified on his behalf. The pastor considers him \nto be reliable, trustworthy, faithful, and a good family man. Applicant stated he is an \nasset to his employer and the agency he serves. Because of his dependability and \nperformance during the last two years, his employer continues to call him to work on a \npart-time basis until his security clearance eligibility is adjudicated. \n \nApplicant was sincerely remorseful and contrite about his financial situation. At \ntimes, his demeanor indicated he is frustrated about his circumstances. He would like to \npay his delinquent debts but finds himself in a \u201ccatch 22\u201d situation. He has been the \nprimary provider for his family and he is not earning sufficient money to pay for his \nfamily\u2019s day-to-day living expenses and his delinquent debts. His take-home pay from \nhis current job was around $1,800 to $2,000 a month. He and his wife are making \nchanges in their lifestyle to save money to pay for their debts. Because his stepdaughter \nand grandchild recently moved to their own apartment, he believes he will now have \nsome additional money at the end of the month to pay his debts. He has participated in \nfinancial counseling through his church and has identified other ways to save money.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged he should have been more diligent in contacting his \ncreditors and establishing payment plans. However, he correctly noted that, because he \ndid not have any money left at the end of the month, it would not have been reasonable \nfor him to attempt to establish payment plans he could not fulfill. Applicant has been \nmost concerned about providing for the day-to-day expenses of his family and making \nsure that he keeps his house and car. In early 2009, Applicant started to pay his small \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndebts. He intends to contact the larger creditors to establish viable payment plans. His \nwife is also looking for a job. With both of them working, they will be able to better \naddress their delinquent debts. Considering the totality of his circumstances, Applicant \nis doing all he can do to resolve his debts. Applicant\u2019s credit reports do not show he has \nbeen making frivolous purchases or spending beyond his financial means.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe President of the United States has the authority to control access to \ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. \nSupreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of \nlaw. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable to reach his decision.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any expressed or implied determination about Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication that the Applicant has not met \nthe strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \n\n \n6 \n \n \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleged 15 delinquent debts in collection or charged off, totaling \napproximately $42,000, which have been delinquent for several years. Applicant \nadmitted, and the record evidence confirms that these are his delinquent accounts, but \nhe disputed the validity of the total charges for some of the accounts. AG \u00b6 19(a): \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \nBetween September 2004 and April 2006, Applicant was unemployed for 11 \nmonths and underemployed in temporary or part-time jobs for 10 months. He was \nunemployed from February to July 2008, and he was suspended and placed on part-\ntime employment when his interim security clearance was suspended in July 2010. His \nwife broke her foot in April 2007, and was placed on short-term disability earning only \n60% of her regular pay. From September 2007 until December 2009, her employer \nplaced her on a part-time schedule because of the employer\u2019s financial situation, and in \nDecember 2009, she was let go from her position because of a reduction in force. \n \nApplicant disclosed his financial problems in his security clearance application. \nHe paid three of the SOR debts in September 2010 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($593), 1.e ($112), and \n1.k ($527)). He made payment arrangements with the creditors of the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l ($12,606) and 1.n ($1,046), and as of the day of his hearing, he had made \ntwo monthly payments towards the rehabilitation of both accounts. He also contacted \nthe Department of Education seeking to establish a new payment plan. Applicant \ndisputed in writing all remaining accounts. In sum, Applicant resolved three of the 15 \ndebts alleged in the SOR, and is making payments on two other debts. Outside of the \n15 delinquent debts discussed above, there is no evidence Applicant had other \ndelinquent debts, or that he was living beyond his financial means.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because most \nof the SOR debts are unresolved (recent behavior). It partially applies because he \nresolved three of the delinquent debts, is making payments on two other debts, and \nappears to have a valid reason to dispute the three medical SOR debts. The evidence \nestablished circumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his \ndebts, i.e., his and his wife\u2019s periods of unemployment and underemployment, and her \ninjury. AG \u00b6 20(b) is fully established by the evidence. Applicant presented sufficient \nevidence showing his efforts to contact creditors and pay his debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies. Applicant participated in financial counseling through his \nchurch. He demonstrated he has the desire to resolve his debts by paying three debts, \nestablishing payment plans for two other debts, and disputing the remaining debts. His \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                           \nactions establish partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d). He receives only partial credit \nbecause he should have been more diligent and aggressive in the resolution of his \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20(e) partially applies because he is in the process of disputing the interest \nand charges on some of the SOR debts, and three medical debts may not be \nestablished.  \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, Applicant has a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problem, albeit dependent on his continued employment. His evidence shows \nthat through the years, he maintained contact with the Department of Education and \nmade payments towards his student loan. He also recently paid three debts and made \npayment arrangements for two other debts. He has a plan to resolve his other SOR \ndebts.3 He intends to pay the smaller debts first and then address the larger debts.  \n \n \nApplicant understands the possible adverse security clearance consequences of \nnot maintaining financial responsibility. I believe that given time, Applicant will resolve \nthe remaining SOR debts and avoid similar financial problems in the future. Although \nApplicant should have been more diligent addressing his debts, and he still has several \nunresolved SOR debts, his past behavior and current financial situation do not raise \ndoubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Financial \nconsiderations concerns are mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \n \n3 \u201c[A]n applicant is not required to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts \nimmediately or simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given his \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d \nthat is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 29, 2009), citing ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n\n \n9 \n \n \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(c) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \nApplicant is a good husband and father. He has been taking care of his \nstepchildren and grandchild for the last 11 years. He has been successful in his job for a \ngovernment contractor since 2008. He is a mature man and a good worker. He has \nsought counseling to overcome his financial problems and understands the importance \nof maintaining financial responsibility. There is no evidence he has ever compromised \nor caused others to compromise classified information. His financial problems do not \nseem to be the result of his living beyond his means or frivolous spending. His financial \nproblems appear to be the result of his and his wife\u2019s periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment. He is doing all he can do under his circumstances to resolve his \nfinancial problems. He has been working hard at his current job, and he and his wife \nhave made life-style changes to resolve their financial problems.  \n \nI find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. He understands the importance of \nmaintaining financial responsibility and what it is expected of him to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. He disclosed his financial problems in his security clearance \napplication. Applicant did not engage in questionable behavior in the acquisition of his \ndebts. His delinquent debts were primarily the result of circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. Considering his circumstances, he has made reasonable efforts to resolve his \nfinancial problems. He started to resolve his financial problems and given the \nopportunity, I believe he will continue to resolve his financial problems and establish full \nfinancial responsibility. Under the whole-person concept, this 38-year-old security \nguard\u2019s current financial problems do not cast doubts on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment.  \n \nThe record evidence establishes Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.o: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On August 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant submitted an undated Answer to the SOR and requested a hearing. On \nJanuary 13, 2010, Department Counsel contacted Applicant to schedule a hearing. \nApplicant stated that she no longer wished to have a hearing and requested that an \nMay 17, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadministrative determination be made on the submitted record. On January 15, 2010, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing 12 Items \nand mailed Applicant a complete copy on January 20, 2010. Applicant received the \nFORM on February 11, 2010, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and \nsubmit additional information. She did not submit any additional information. On April \n21, 2010, DOHA assigned the case to me. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.h, 1.t, 1.y, 1.z, and 1.aa. Those admissions are incorporated into the \nfollowing findings. She denied the remaining 19 allegations.

She was divorced in \n1993. She has a 13-year-old daughter. Since June 2008, she has worked as an \ninstrumentation mechanic for her current employer. (Item 5.) \n \n \nIn July 1999, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy that was discharged in \nNovember 1999. The record does not contain any information regarding the underlying \nreason that she filed the action or the amount of discharged debt. (Item 11.) On July 28, \n2004, she filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy as a result of an illness that prevented her from \nworking from \u201cthe latter part of 2003 thru the first part of 2004.\u201d (Item 5 at 35.) It was \ndismissed on April 18, 2006, because Applicant could no longer make the $382 monthly \npayments after she was seriously injured in a car accident in July 2005 and unable to \nwork.1 (Item 5 at 33-35; Item 11.) \n \n \nOn May 7, 2009, Applicant submitted a Response to Interrogatories requesting \ninformation about 23 delinquent debts listed on an August 2008 credit bureau report \n(CBR.) She noted that \u201cThese accounts are in dispute. Currently with a credit repair \nprogram: \u2018Dream Consulting Credit Repair.\u2019\u201d They are in the process of removing these \naccounts from my credit. What documentation will be acceptable to verify?\u201d (Item .7) At \nleast nine of those delinquent accounts were previously included in the Chapter 13 \nBankruptcy that was dismissed on April 2006. (Item 7; 11 at 39-40.) \n \n \nApplicant attached a copy of her budget to that Response. Her net monthly \nincome is $3,460 and expenses are $1,915. After making a $579 car payment on a loan \nbalance of $21,680, she has approximately $965 remaining at the end of the month. \n(Item 7.) \n \n                                                          \n1According to her e-QIP, Applicant was also involved in a car accident in January 2006 and in \nFebruary 2008. She was at fault in the January 2006 accident and was hit by a drunk driver in February \n2008. (Item 5 at 37.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn September 2009, Applicant submitted a copy of a credit file investigation that \nseemingly referenced the disputes she filed in May 2009. She stated in her letter that \n\u201cMost of the delinquent accounts have either been paid, incorrect, and/or disputed and \nhave since been removed from my credit history/report. This can be verified with an \nupdated credit report.\u201d (Item 6.) She did not cross reference the findings of that \ndocument to the individual debts listed on the SOR or provide any explanation of its \nfindings. She did not detail which debts were paid, which were incorrect, and which \nwere disputed. She provided no other documents to specifically address the status of \neach delinquent debt \n \n \nApplicant admitted that she has approximately $18,000 of delinquent debt. She \ndid not provide evidence that she obtained financial counseling or established a \nrepayment plan with any of the six creditors. Of the four debts that she claimed she \nsuccessfully disputed, the record evidence documented that SOR \u00b6 1.c remains unpaid \nas of the January 2010 CBR (Item 8.); SOR \u00b6 1.o is paid (Item 9.); and, the status of the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c and \u00b6 1.s is unclear. The status of the majority of the 15 \ndebts that she asserted were paid or resolved also remains unsubstantiated, except \u00b6 \n1.n ($164) which is paid (Item 9.). For example, she asserted that the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j ($1,311), 1.k ($433), and 1.l ($249) are owed to the same credit card \ncompany and are resolved. (Item 4.) However, the January 2010 CBR noted that one \naccount was paid in the amount of $253. (Item 8.) There is no evidence indicating that \nthe other two accounts were settled along with that account. She did not provide any \npaid receipts or letters from creditors corroborating her assertions regarding the \npayment or resolution of most of the 19 individual debts.  \n \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence concerning the quality of her job performance. \nShe submitted no character references or other evidence tending to establish good \njudgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate her credibility, \ndemeanor, or character in person since she elected to have her case decided without a \nhearing. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the Adjudicative Guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n\n \n4 \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe evidence established security concerns under two Guideline F disqualifying \nconditions, specifically AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;@ and \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.@ Based on CBRs, two \nbankruptcies, and her admissions, Applicant has a history of being unable or unwilling \nto satisfy debts dating back to 1999. The evidence is sufficient to raise these two \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut or prove mitigation of those security concerns. The guideline includes \nfive conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from financial issues. Under \nAG \u00b6 20(a), a disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened \nso long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.@ Applicant experienced financial delinquencies in 1999, resulting in the \nfiling of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In 2004, she filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy after she \naccrued additional delinquent debts. To-date she has between $18,000 and $28,000 of \ndebt that remains unresolved. Because the ongoing problems are not isolated and there \nis no evidence to support a finding that delinquent indebtedness is unlikely to recur, the \nsituation casts doubt on her reliability and this condition does not apply.   \n \nAG & 20(b) states that it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant \nattributed her recent financial problems to a 2003 illness and 2005 car accident, which \nwere conditions beyond her control. She submitted evidence that she attempted to \nresolve her indebtedness by filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2004 and complied with \nthe payments until 2006. The record does not contain information regarding the specific \nsteps she took subsequently to manage her debts. Hence, this mitigating condition has \nonly partial application.  \n \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows that Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Because she did not submit evidence that she \nreceived credit counseling (other than a reference to some debt resolution company) or \ndocumentation that her financial problems are under control, AG \u00b6 20(c) cannot apply. \nAlthough she asserted that she paid or resolved 19 debts, the evidence in the record \ndoes not support those assertions, except for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.o, and \n1.n. Hence, AG & 20(d) has limited application. \n \nApplicant provided evidence that she disputed debts in May 2009. However, the \noutcome of that dispute as it relates to the debts alleged in the SOR is not clear, \nespecially as to those debts that were previously included in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nrepayment plan. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(e) that provides mitigation when \u201can individual has a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issues\u201d has limited application.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual, who \nhas worked for a defense contractor for the past two years. In May 2009, she learned of \nthe Government\u2019s concerns relating to her delinquent debts and indicated that she was \ndisputing them. In August 2009, the Government filed a SOR. On January 13, 2010, she \nnotified Department Counsel that she no longer wanted a hearing in the matter. On \nJanuary 15, 2010, the Government filed a FORM and specifically notified her that she \nfailed to provide documentation supporting her assertions regarding the resolution of 19 \ndebts. Despite that notification, she did not submit additional information to substantiate \nher claims as to those debts. Nor did she present any evidence indicating that she was \naddressing the $18,000 of delinquent debt that she acknowledged. Applicant failed to \nprovide sufficient evidence to document the establishment of a track record of financial \nresponsibility or resolution, which would prevent a recurrence or continuance of similar \nproblems in the future. The record contains insufficient evidence about her character, \ntrustworthiness, or reliability to further mitigate these concerns or make their \ncontinuation less likely. \n \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations. \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k:  \n     Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n     For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \n     Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n and 1.o: \n \n     For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.p through 1.aa:                 Against Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She \npaid two debts, and her county property tax account is now current. Her other two SOR \ndebts, totaling about $17,500, are in established payment plans. Applicant mitigated \nfinancial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 4, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations \nProcessing \n(e-QIP) \nor \nsecurity \nclearance \napplication \n(SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On April 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 6), pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nJuly 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nThe \nSOR \nalleged \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations)(GE 6). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn April 22, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 7). On June 1, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed. On June 2, 2009, DOHA assigned the \ncase to me. On June 15, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 5). At the hearing \nheld on July 8, 2009, Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 11-3) (Tr. 18-19), \nand Applicant offered three exhibits (Tr. 20-22; AE A-C). There were no objections to \nadmission of the proffered documents, and I admitted them (Tr. 19, 22). I admitted the \nNotice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 5-7). On July 16, 2009, I \nreceived the transcript. On July 23, 2009, I received seven post-hearing exhibits. These \nseven exhibits were admitted without objection as AE D-J. I closed the record on July \n24, 2009.    \n   \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 6, 23). She \ngraduated from high school in 1987 (Tr. 6, 24). She does not have any prior military \nservice (Tr. 27). In May 1992, she received a bachelor of science degree with a major in \nbusiness administration (Tr. 7, 24). She has some post-graduate education in \noperations management (Tr. 8). She is a management analyst (Tr. 23). She currently \ndoes not have access to classified information (Tr. 8). She has held a public trust \nposition from September 2008 to October 2008, when it was changed to an interim \nsecret clearance (Tr. 8, 25-27). Her interim Secret clearance was suspended in April \n2009 (Tr. 27). She has not been involved in any security-related incidents (Tr. 28).  \n \nApplicant has been married for the last 17 years (Tr. 23). She does not have any \nchildren (Tr. 23). She and her husband recently moved from one state (T) to another \nstate (V) (Tr. 24). They own their home in state T. It is valued at about $115,000 (Tr. \n99). In February 2009, she and her husband moved in with Applicant\u2019s sister in state V \n(Tr. 24, 110).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant \nattributed \nher \nfinancial \nproblems \nto \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment (Tr. 117). After her income was substantially reduced because of \nchanges in her employment status, she attempted to keep her accounts current, and \nthen when she was unable to make payments, she negotiated and renegotiated her \n \n1 Department Counsel noted that GE 1 is missing pages 10 through 12 (Transcript (Tr.) 15). \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \npayment plans (Tr. 117). She did not want to resolve her debts through bankruptcy (Tr. \n117-118). She maintained contact with her creditors. \n \nFrom 1999 to 2007, Applicant worked for a non-profit corporation (Tr. 105). \nApplicant was unemployed from January 2007 to October 2008 (Tr. 103). Her \nhusband\u2019s annual pay until 2004 was about $45,000 (Tr. 105). In July 2004, her \nhusband went on disability and began receiving about $1,300 per month (Tr. 106). \nWhile she was unemployed, she and her husband lived on savings and money \nborrowed from family and friends (Tr. 104). When her parents passed away, she \nreceived the proceeds from some small life insurance policies (Tr. 104). She held some \npart-time employment during January 2007 to October 2008 (AE C). \n \nApplicant\u2019s adjusted gross income from 2003 to September 2008 was as follows: \n2003--over $100,000; 2004--$97,000; 2005--$61,000; 2006--$60,000; 2007--$23,272 \nand January to September 2008--$16,256 (Tr. 106-109; AE C).   \n \n \nOn August 1, 2009, a tenant will begin paying monthly rent of $830 on \nApplicant\u2019s home in state T (Tr. 80-83; AE A at 8-9). Applicant received an $830 deposit \nfrom the tenant (AE A at 10). Her mortgage payment on the house in state T is $898, \nand it is current (Tr. 81-82). Her mortgage is about $114,500 (GE 2 at 4). She pays \n$345 monthly to keep her equity loan of about $16,000 on her house current (Tr. 82; GE \n2 at 4).  \n \nApplicant bought a time-share property in 2004 for $14,000 (Tr. 83-85). After \npaying about $4,000, she was unable to continue to make payments because of \nunemployment (Tr. 85). She did a deed transfer back to the owners, and paid $250 (Tr. \n85). The time-share property was not foreclosed and there is no adverse information \nabout the deed-transfer transaction in her credit reports (Tr. 85). \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR did not describe any bankruptcy filings. However, it listed five \ndelinquent debts, which are fully discussed in the next five paragraphs. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($18,163 owed on a judgment)\u2014Payment Plan. In January 2007, as \nsoon as Applicant became unemployed she informed the creditor, and the creditor told \nher to continue to make at least the minimal monthly payments of $326 (Tr. 36-37). In \nFebruary 2008, the account became delinquent because Applicant had been \nunemployed for a year and had only made sporadic payments (Tr. 34). In October 2008, \nshe contacted the creditor (Tr. 33). The creditor advised her that the creditor transferred \nher account to a law firm (Tr. 32). In December 2008, Applicant sent a written offer to \nmake monthly payments of $200, starting February 20, 2009 (GE 2 at 14). In January \n2009, she received a summons for the judgment (Tr. 33). The creditor obtained a \njudgment for $18,163. From February to July 2009, she paid the creditor $1,500 in \naccordance with her payment plan, reducing the amount of the debt to about $16,800 \nas follows: $200 in February (GE 7 at 9); $200 in March (GE 6 at 2); $200 in April (GE 6 \nat 2; AE E at 2); $300 in May (AE A at 3, 5); $300 in June; and $300 in July (Tr. 41-44; \nGE 6 at 2; AE A at 2; AE F). She intends to continue making monthly payments of at \nleast $300. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($374 owed to a telecommunications company)\u2014Paid. Applicant \nswitched phone services and was unaware of the debt until DOHA informed her of its \nexistence (Tr. 46-50). She paid half on May 1, 2009, and the other half on June 1, 2009 \n(Tr. 50; AE G). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($3,979 owed to a credit card company)\u2014Payment Plan. In January \n2007, as soon as Applicant became unemployed, she informed the creditor of the \nchange in her employment status (Tr. 53-54). In April 2009, she and the creditor agreed \nthat she would make an initial payment of $435, and $100 monthly thereafter through \nDecember 2009 (Tr. 56-60; AE F at 1). She provided documentation showing the \nfollowing payments: April 20, 2009--$435 (Tr. 56; GE 9 at 13); April 21, 2009--$100 (AE \nF at 2); May 28, 2009--$100 (AE A at 5); June 18, 2009--$100 (AE A at 4); and July 13, \n2009--$100 (AE F at 4). She currently owes $500 on this debt (Tr. 57-60). Once the tax \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is paid, she will use the extra $300 a month to pay this debt (Tr. 102). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($3,091 owed to credit card company)\u2014Paid. On October 18, 2008, \nApplicant made a written offer to the creditor to pay $60 a month (Tr. 64; GE 7 at 21). \nOn November 17, 2008, the creditor wrote Applicant about settlement terms (GE 7 at \n20). On January 20, 2009 and February 20, 2009, Applicant paid the creditor $75 (Tr. \n64; GE 7 at 18, 19). On February 18, 2009, she paid the creditor $100 (GE 7 at 15). In \nan undated letter, the creditor offered to settle the debt for $1,765 (GE 7 at 17). At some \npoint the settlement amount was reduced to $1,176, and on April 20, 2009, Applicant \npaid $1,176 (Tr. 63; GE 7 at 16). Credit records, dated June 12, 2009, reflect this debt \nas paid (Tr. 65; AE A at 6). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($2,632 owed for delinquent property taxes)\u2014Account is current. A \ncounty property tax bill, dated March 12, 2009, showed that she owed $1,442 for tax \nyear 2007 and $1,208 for tax year 2008 (Tr. 68; GE 2 at 23). On April 17, 2009, she \npaid $1,442 (Tr. 68; GE 7 at 22). A subsequent tax record shows all property taxes for \nthe years 1994 to 2008 were paid, except for tax year 2008 (AE A at 7). This country \nproperty tax record showed she owed $964 for tax year 2008 (AE A at 7). She learned \nshe has until September 30, 2009, to pay the property taxes for 2008 (Tr. 69). On June \n28, 2009, she paid $300 towards her 2008 county property tax debt (Tr. 70; AE A at 7).  \nAs of July 14, 2009, she owed $664 (AE H). She planned to pay $300 in July 2009 and \nthe balance of $364 in August 2009 (Tr. 70). \n \n \nApplicant has three non-SOR related credit cards and a car loan of about $7,000 \n(Tr. 72-73). Her car loan is current (Tr. 73). One credit card has a balance of $1,400, \nanother has a balance of about $4,700, and the third credit card had a $12 balance (Tr. \n74, 77). She paid the account with a $12 balance, and the other two credit cards are \ncurrent (Tr. 74-76). She pays a total of $245 monthly to keep the two credit cards \ncurrent (Tr. 78-79). Her student loan of about $21,000 is in forbearance until January \n2010 (Tr. 73; GE 2 at 4). She paid off another non-SOR credit card debt (Tr. 75).  She \nborrowed $9,000 from her sister and is repaying her with monthly $300 payments (Tr. \n97). She borrowed $2,300 from her brother and $4,000 from a friend; however, they \nhave agreed that she does not need to make payments until her financial situation has \nstabilized (Tr. 97; GE 2 at 4-5). She is not required to pay interest on the loans from her \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nfamily and a friend (Tr. 123-124). She also plans to stay with her sister until she reaches \nfinancial stability (Tr. 124-125). She expects to reach financial stability, including \nrepaying her family and friend, in about a year (Tr.125). She anticipates all SOR debts, \nincluding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, will be paid in 18 months (Tr. 125).   \n \n \nOn February 24, 2009, Applicant prepared a personal financial statement (GE 2 \nat 4). Her gross salary is $5,833, and her net salary is $4,534 (Tr. 86).  Her husband \nreceives $1,545 in monthly disability payments, and their monthly rent from their home \nin state T is $830 (Tr. 86). Monthly expenses are as follows: food ($150); clothing \n($100); cell phone ($75); car payment ($794); car insurance ($170); other car expenses \n($500); life and medical insurance ($210); and miscellaneous ($200) (Tr. 87-93).  After \npaying her monthly expenses and debt payments about $2,300 remains, which she \nplans to use to rapidly pay her balances owed to various creditors (Tr. 99).  She has \nenrolled in consumer credit counseling (AE D, I). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister has worked for the Department of Defense for 28 years (AE B). \nHer descriptions of Applicant\u2018s unemployment and Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s medical \ndisability are consistent with Applicant\u2019s disclosures above. Her sister described \nApplicant\u2019s numerous positive character traits, including her dedication, discipline, \nintegrity, honesty, loyalty, and good judgment (AE B). Her sister recommends \nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was sufficient to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are \nof security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is also documented in her \nSOR response and her oral statement at her hearing. She failed to ensure her creditors \nwere paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is \nrequired. \n  \n   \nFive conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may mitigate security concerns and are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because she \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent debts after \nreturning to employment in September 2008.3 Her delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing \ncourse of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, \n2002)). She receives partial credit because her delinquent debts \u201coccurred under such \ncircumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d I am convinced that she will continue \nwith her payment plans and resolve all of her SOR debts. Her SOR debts do not \u201ccast \ndoubt on [her] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  \n \n \n3 For example, Applicant could have made monthly payments of $100 to $200 to the creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a from October 2008 to February 2009 without waiting for a payment plan to be established. \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because her financial problems \ninitially resulted because of unemployment, underemployment and her spouse\u2019s \ndisability.4 She does not receive full mitigating credit because she did not establish that \nshe acted with sufficient initiative and resolve to address her delinquent debts.     \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) fully applies. Applicant began her financial counseling. Moreover, she \ndemonstrated a firm grasp of budgeting, payment plans, and expense reduction. She \nhas the self-discipline necessary to reduce and resolve her debts. There are \u201cclear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d She has also \nestablished full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because she showed good faith5 in the \nresolution of her SOR debts.   \n \nApplicant did not contest the validity of any debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Her SOR listed five debts totaling about \n$28,200. She paid two debts, and her county property tax account is now current. Her \nother two SOR debts, totaling about $17,500, are in established payment plans. In \nOctober 2008, she began the process of establishing payment plans and resolved some \nof her delinquent debts, substantially before she received the SOR on April 6, 2009. \nShe promised to continue to comply with her payment plans until all of her SOR debts \nare resolved. I am confident she will keep her promise6 because of her substantial \nrecent progress on SOR debt resolution.    \n \n4\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n6 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit \nreports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the \ngovernment from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                            \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial conduct. When \nshe was began her new employment in September 2008, she should have been more \naggressive in her efforts to ensure she established payment plans on her delinquent \ndebts. She had sufficient income to make greater progress in delinquent debt resolution. \nThese factors show some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. Her history of \ndelinquent debt raises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is sufficient to warrant \nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. There is no evidence of any security \nviolation(s). She is a law-abiding citizen. Her current financial problems were caused by \nfactors beyond her control: (1) insufficient income; (2) her spouse\u2019s disability; (3) \nunemployment; and (4) underemployment. Her SOR lists five debts totaling about \n$28,200. She paid two debts, and her county property tax account is now current. Her \nother two SOR debts, totaling about $17,500, are in established payment plans. Her \nother debts, such as her car payments, mortgage, line of credit, credit cards and student \nloan are current or in forbearance. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in \nthe whole person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \n \nto pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future \nrevocation of a security clearance. Completion of a security clearance decision documents and \nestablishes a warning to Applicants about the importance of financial responsibility and retention of \ndocumentation about debt resolution. The comments in this footnote do not imply that this clearance is \nconditional. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  \n \nApplicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, \ndemonstrating her self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. She graduated from \nhigh school, earned a bachelor of science degree, and has accumulated some post-\ngraduate credits towards her master\u2019s degree. Her employment history and \ncontributions to a defense contractor speak well for her character. She understands how \nto budget and what she needs to do to establish her financial responsibility. Applicant \nhas demonstrated her loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through her service to the \nDepartment of Defense as an employee of a defense contractor.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nfinancial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is eligible for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:   \n FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.e: \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant two sets of interrogatories  to clarify or augment information about\n1\npotentially disqualifying information in his background. After reviewing the results of the\nbackground investigation and Applicant\u2019s responses to the interrogatories, DOHA\nadjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n2\nMay 26, 2010\n\n The adjudicative guidelines were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.\n3\nPending official revision of the Directive, they take precedence over the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective.\n2\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified\ninformation. On June 30, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) alleging facts which, if proven, raise security concerns addressed in the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG)  for foreign influence (Guideline B) and personal conduct\n3\n(Guideline E).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on February 5, 2010. Pursuant to a Notice of Hearing issued the same\nday, I convened a hearing in this matter on February 23, 2010. The parties appeared as\nscheduled. The Government presented five exhibits (Gx. 1 - 5), which were admitted\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of\nhearing (Tr.) on March 3, 2010.\nDepartment Counsel also asked in a pre-hearing submission, a copy of which\nwas also sent to Applicant, that I take administrative notice of informational documents\npertaining to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Those documents are included in the record as\nJx. I (Afghanistan) and Jx. II (Pakistan). (Tr. 46 - 48) With one exception, which I\naddressed at the hearing my factual findings about those countries is based solely on\ninformation in those exhibits.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline B, the Government alleged that Applicant\u2019s father (SOR 1.a),\nmother (SOR 1.b), brother (SOR 1.c), and sister (SOR 1.d) are citizens of and reside in\nAfghanistan. The Government further alleged that his father-in-law (SOR 1.e) and\nmother-in-law (SOR 1.f) are citizens of Afghanistan but reside in Pakistan. Also, the\nGovernment alleged that in about 2005, Applicant gave his cousin about $1,200 to help\npay for construction of a school in Afghanistan (SOR 1.g); that in about September\n1989, he emigrated from Pakistan to the United States illegally using forged documents\nfor which he paid about $3,000 (SOR 1.h); that he served in the Afghan Army from\nabout June 1988 to August 1988 (SOR 1.i); and that he traveled to Pakistan in 1998\nand 2006 (SOR 1.j). \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant deliberately tried to\nconceal from the Government the fact, as alleged at SOR 1.i, that he had served in the\nAfghan Army in 1988 when he answered \u201cno\u201d to e-QIP question 17.b (Your Foreign\nActivities, b. Are you now or have you ever been employed by or acted as a consultant\nfor a foreign government, firm, or agency?) (SOR 2.a); and in a September 2, 2008,\nsubject interview when he told an investigator that he had never served in the Afghan\nArmy (SOR 2.b); and when he answered \u201cno\u201d to a question about foreign military\nservice in the February 28, 2009, interrogatories from DOHA adjudicators (1.

Finally, through SOR 2.d, the Government cross-alleged\nas adverse personal conduct the facts recited in SOR 1.h.\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. However,\nat the hearing, he amended his answer to deny the allegations that he ever served in\nthe Afghan Army. Accordingly, he has denied the allegations at SOR 1.i, and 2.a - 2.c.\n(Tr. 14 - 25) Having reviewed Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, the transcript, and\nexhibits, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 46 years old and is employed as a translator with the U.S. military in\nAfghanistan, his native country. Applicant was born and raised in or near Kabul, the\nAfghan capital city. His parents live  in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and his brother\n4\nand sister live in a rural area west of Kabul. He speaks with them about twice a year,\nbut has not seen either of them in several years. Applicant\u2019s wife was also born and\nraised Afghanistan. They have been married since June 1998 and they have two\nchildren, ages seven and five, both of whom were born in the United States. Applicant\nwas naturalized as a U.S. citizen in February 1998. His wife received her U.S.\ncitizenship in July 2008. (Gx. 1; Gx. 3)\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are both citizens of Afghanistan, but\nthey reside in a city in western Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan. Applicant\nbelieves his father-in-law served in the Afghan army several years ago as required of all\nAfghan males of a certain age. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law and sister-in-law are Afghan\ncitizens, but they live and work in Canada. Applicant has had little or no contact with\nthem. When Applicant is in the United States, he has had little contact with his relatives\nin Afghanistan because telephone service is poor. However, he is able to contact his\nparents and siblings more easily when he is in Afghanistan working for the Army. He is\nnot allowed to visit them unless he is on leave from his job. (Gx. 3; Tr. 79 - 80, 86)\nAs required for his work as a translator, Applicant has traveled overseas to\nAfghanistan, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and Kyrgyzstan. However, he also\ntraveled to Pakistan in 1998 to marry his wife, and in 2006 with his wife and children to\nvisit her family. (Gx. 1; Gx. 3) Applicant used his U.S. passport for all of his foreign\ntravel. (Gx. 4)\nAfghanistan has been an independent nation ruled by indigenous monarchs\nsince 1919, when the British Empire relinquished control. However, in 1979, the Soviet\nUnion invaded Afghanistan and occupied the country until 1989. Thereafter, a civil war\nended when the Taliban took control of the government and established a regime based\non an extreme fundamentalist version of Islamic law. Human rights were virtually non-\nexistent, especially for women, and dissent was countered through violent repression.\nThe Taliban regime also created circumstances that allowed Osama bin Laden and al-\nQaida safe haven and resources for international terrorist actions that culminated in the\nattacks on the U.S. on September 11, 2001. \n\n A cousin gave him the money. (Tr. 108)\n5\n4\nThe subsequent U.S. military actions against the Taliban allowed the\nestablishment of an openly-elected government based on a western democratic model.\nHowever, the country remains unstable and human rights abuses continue at the hands\nof the Taliban in areas they still control. The Afghan government continues to struggle in\nits efforts to overcome a legacy of corruption, and U.S.-led coalition forces have been\nunable to provide a secure environment either in the countryside or in Afghanistan\u2019s\nurban centers. U.S. personnel are at constant risk of attack, kidnapping, and other\nhostile acts by insurgents.\nPakistan is characterized as a \u201cparliamentary federal republic.\u201d Most of its\nwestern border abuts Afghanistan. Pakistan\u2019s western topography along with regional\npolitical alliances within the western and northwestern areas of Pakistan have kept the\nPakistani government and its military from securing the border against Taliban, al-\nQaida, and other insurgent activities against U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan.\nAfter the 9-11 attacks, Pakistan joined the U.S. in the Global War on Terror; however,\nmore recently, Pakistan has allowed Taliban factions to establish local governments\nalong the Afghan border based on strict Islamic law. Taliban influence also has\nextended to urban areas in western Pakistan, resulting in increased safe havens for\ninsurgents attacking U.S. troops in Afghanistan and as a base of operations for\ninternational terrorist organizations. Pakistan\u2019s human rights record has been poor of\nlate, largely as a result of the exercise of broad, unchecked police powers in the name\nof anti-terror and anti-insurgency measures.\nApplicant left Afghanistan in 1988 because of the Soviet occupation there. He\nlived as a refugee in Pakistan until July 1989, when he paid someone $3,000  for forged\n5\ndocuments used to enter the U.S. illegally. (Gx. 3; Tr. 60 - 63) The money paid was also\nfor that person to travel to the U.S. with Applicant. On arrival at an international airport\nin the U.S., the person abandoned Applicant. When Applicant came to the attention of\nauthorities at the airport, he was detained for several months, but was provided legal aid\nservices and was eventually able to obtain his green card. (Gx. 3)\nOn several occasions since about October 2005, Applicant has worked for\ndefense contractors as a \u201crole player\u201d to support training of U.S. military personnel\nbeing deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. In June 2007, he began working as a translator\nfor a defense contractor supporting U.S. Army personnel in Afghanistan. He was given\nan interim clearance, which was never finalized (ostensibly because his contract\nended). \nIn December 2008, when he was hired for his current translator position with a\ndefense contractor for the Army, he submitted his e-QIP for his security clearance. He\nwas also interviewed by Army personnel as part of an overseas screening process.\nApplicant was asked numerous questions about his background in addition to the\nquestions in the e-QIP. In response to question 19 of the overseas screening\nquestionnaire, Applicant stated that he had served in the Afghan Army from June 1988\nuntil August 1988, but deserted because the Army was run by the occupying Soviet\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n Directive. 6.3.\n7\n5\nforces. Applicant did not want to serve the Soviets, and he was sure he would be killed\nby the Afghan rebels who were fighting the Soviets. (Gx. 3, Screening Questionnaire,\nQuestions 19 and 52) Applicant did not disclose his Afghan military service in response\nto e-QIP question 17, the only e-QIP question that contemplates employment by, or\nother official interaction with or on behalf of a foreign government. (Gx. 1) When he was\ninterviewed during his background investigation, Applicant denied to the investigating\nagent that he had ever served in the Afghan army. (Gx. 3) In response to DOHA\ninterrogatories, which specifically asked about service or membership in a foreign\nmilitary organization (Gx. 2, Question 1.c), Applicant denied ever having served in the\nAfghan Army. \nFinally, at the hearing Applicant repeatedly denied having served in the Afghan\narmy. (Tr. 63, 93 - 96) He testified that he remembered the occasion when the overseas\nscreening document was completed, and he denied making the statement in response .\nAside from insisting that the screening questionnaire was generally inaccurate, he could\nnot explain why the interviewer would include the specific remarks about his alleged\nservice and desertion. (Tr. 70 - 71, 113 - 114)\nApplicant still has contact with members of his extended family in Afghanistan.\nSometime in 2005, Applicant sent a cousin $1,200 to help finance the construction of a\nschool in a rural area west of Kabul. Applicant and the cousin were questioned about\nthis by U.S. government officials because the cousin had transferred more than $10,000\nto Afghanistan in connection with the school construction effort. (Gx. 3)\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n7\nin the adjudicative guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n8\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n6\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 6 (Foreign Influence - Guideline B) and AG \u00b6 15\n(Personal Conduct - Guideline E).\nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to\nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a\nsecurity clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who\n8\nhas access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling\ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.9\nAnalysis\nForeign Influence. \nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the factual\nallegations in SOR \u00b6 1. Those allegations, all of which Applicant admits, except for SOR\n1.i, raise security concerns about Applicant\u2019s personal relationships and other interests\nin Afghanistan and Pakistan. Specifically, as stated in AG \u00b6 6, \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAt the outset, the Government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s illegal entry 22\nyears ago into the United States is not disqualifying under this guideline. His conduct in\n\n7\nthis regard does not indicate he was unduly influenced by his interests in either\nAfghanistan or Pakistan. He was trying to escape Soviet aggression in his native land\nand trying to create a better life for himself than would have been possible as a refugee\nin Pakistan. SOR 1.h is resolved for the Applicant. The Government\u2019s information also\nsupported the allegation (SOR 1.i) that Applicant served in the Afghan army in 1988.\nHowever, it is also clear that the Afghan army was likely a Soviet-run organization made\nup of unwilling conscripts who were forced to fight against their countrymen fighting for\nan insurgency the U.S. was supporting at the time. A brief, involuntary participation in\nsuch an organization more than 22 years ago does not require application of any of the\ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline.\nAs to the remaining allegations, the facts established through the Government\u2019s\ninformation in support of SOR 1.a - 1.f require application of the disqualifying conditions\nat AG \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion). By definition, Applicant is close to his immediate family (his parents and two\nsiblings living in Afghanistan). There is also a rebuttable presumption that, by virtue of\nhis relationship with his wife, that he is closely tied to her parents, who are citizens of\nAfghanistan but reside in Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan. The facts\nestablished through SOR 1.j are not in and of themselves disqualifying. But Applicant\u2019s\ntravel back to Pakistan to get married in 1998, and in 2006 with his wife and children to\nvisit his wife\u2019s family is indicative of his close ties to persons in Pakistan. \nAlso indicative of his ties to persons in Afghanistan is his donation of money to\nhis cousin to help build a school there. (SOR 1.g) This, of course, is a worthy endeavor,\nbut the security significance of such ties to foreign national family and associates must\nbe taken into account. Further, in light of available information about the instability of\nboth the Afghan and Pakistani governments, and the widespread anti-U.S. violence and\ninternational terrorism concerns in that region, the presence of Applicant\u2019s close ties of\naffection in both countries creates a heightened risk of exploitation.\nAvailable information does not support any of the other disqualifying conditions\nunder AG \u00b6 7. By contrast, the Applicant has not presented any information that would\nsupport application of any of the mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 8. The\nmitigating condition at AG \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so\ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation) does not apply because, although his contact with family\noverseas is infrequent, his ties are close and contact with them increases when he is\nactually working in Afghanistan. The Government presented sufficient information to\nsupport the factual allegations in the SOR, thereby shifting the burden of persuasion to\nthe Applicant to mitigate, extenuate, or refute the allegations. Because he failed to do\nso, the security concerns about possible foreign influence remain.\nPersonal Conduct\nIn SOR 2.d, the Government cross-referenced the allegation in SOR 1.h as a\nsecurity concern under Guideline E. For the same reasons his conduct was mitigated\n\n See footnote 7, supra.\n10\n8\nunder Guideline B, it likewise is mitigated under this guideline. SOR 2.d is resolved for\nthe Applicant. \nAs to the allegations that Applicant knowingly and wilfully made false statements\nto the Government when he omitted foreign military service from his e-QIP (SOR 2.a),\nduring an interview with a Government investigator (SOR 2.b), and in response to\nDOHA interrogatories (SOR 2.c), the Government has met its burden of producing\nsufficient reliable information to support those allegations. While the language in e-QIP\nquestion 17 does not specifically refer to military service, his repeated unexplained\nomissions of that information tends to show that he intended, for whatever reason, to\nconceal his Afghan military service. All of the information presented raises a security\nconcern that is expressed at AG \u00b6 15 as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nMore specifically, available information supports application of the disqualifying\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities) and AG \u00b6 16b) (deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official,\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative). By contrast,\nhe did not provide any information that would support any of the mitigating conditions\nlisted at AG \u00b6 17. On balance, he has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by\nhis responses to Government questions about relevant information in his background.\nWhole-Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines B and E. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Available information\nshows that Applicant, 46 years old, is a mature, responsible father and husband. He has\na record of steady, reliable employment, but he provided no favorable personal or\nprofessional information that outweighs the adverse information about his foreign ties of\naffection or his alleged lack of candor during his background investigation. A fair and\ncommonsense assessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s past and\n10\ncurrent circumstances shows he has not addressed satisfactorily the Government\u2019s\ndoubts about his ability and willingness to protect the Government\u2019s interests as his\n\n See footnote 9, supra. \n11\n9\nown. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations,\nsuch doubts must be resolved for the government.11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.h - 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn November 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG), effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 5, 2010, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 23, \n2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 26, 2010. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on April 28, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 21, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits \n(AE) A through D, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open \nuntil May 12, 2010, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. He did not submit \nany documents and the record closed. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nMay 6, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, 1.i, and \n1.k. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old. He is a high school graduate and graduated from \nvocational school. He served in the Navy and was honorably discharged. He is \nemployed as a truck driver and lives in his truck. Applicant married in 1995, and has two \nchildren from the marriage. His wife passed away in 1998. He remarried in 1999 and \ndivorced in 2000. He remarried in 2004 and had a child from the marriage. He divorced \nin 2004, and remarried in 2008. His present wife is also a truck driver and they drive as \na team.1  \n \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s first wife passed away, he had a custody dispute with her \nparents, for his two children and spent money for a lawyer to represent him. During this \ntime he accumulated many credit card debts. He also experienced periods of \nunemployment. The grandparents were awarded custody of the children. Applicant does \nnot pay child support for the two children. He does pay child support for the child he had \nwith his third wife. He admitted he accumulated additional debt after each of his \nmarriages. He did not want to file bankruptcy.2 \n \nApplicant admitted he was the beneficiary of his wife\u2019s life insurance benefits, \nwhich were $100,000. He placed $10,000 in accounts for each of his two children. He \nloaned $30,000 to his mother for a down payment on a house. She never repaid him. \nHe spent $10,000 for his wife\u2019s funeral. He paid $17,000 on a loan for a truck he \npurchased for $30,000. He took the remaining money and had a financial consultant \ninvest it for him. He learned that this person bilked him of his money. He stated 23 other \nfamilies were also victims. He believed the person was pursued criminally. He never \nwas reimbursed the amount he invested.3 \n \n \nAfter Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management \ninvestigator, he understood that he needed to address his delinquent debts. He \ncontacted a debt consolidation company (Company A) to help him organize and pay his \ndelinquent debts. He stated he sent Company A any bills he received or delinquent \n \n1 Tr. 94-96, 103-108, 112. \n \n2 Tr. 20-21. \n \n3 Tr. 69-73. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \ndebts he was aware of, and the company was to consolidate them and arrange a \nrepayment plan. He began making monthly payments of $758.70 to Company A to pay \nhis delinquent debts. It does not appear, at this time, that any of the debts alleged in the \nSOR are included in the repayment plan. Some of Applicant\u2019s other delinquent debts \nare being paid through Company A. He continues to send Company A any new bills he \nreceives and assumed they were consolidating them with all of his other debts. His \nunderstanding was they would also review his current credit report, contact the creditors \nhe owed money to, and negotiate settlements. Applicant admitted he never provided \nCompany A with a list of his debts nor did he receive a list of debts that they were going \nto pay. Applicant has made monthly payments since April 2009 on the debts in the plan \nthat Company A arranged, but he has not addressed any of his other debts. He believes \nthat Company A will eventually pay all of the delinquent debts that he provided to them. \nHe believes Company A is using a credit report to address his debts. He did not have a \ncopy of the credit report they are presumably using. It appears that Company A has \nused Applicant\u2019s monthly payment to pay different creditors. At some point, a creditor \nthey have paid drops off the plan because presumably the debt is resolved, and another \ncreditor is added and payments are directed toward that creditor. Applicant did not \nprovide a list of the creditors that have been paid or that are going to be paid by \nCompany A.4  \n \n \nApplicant admitted he owed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($15,426). This debt was a \nloan for a vehicle that was repossessed approximately three years ago. Company A \nreached a settlement agreement to make 15 payments and pay a total of $6,890. \nApplicant was to begin making the payments in April 2010. No payments were made at \nthe time of the hearing.5 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($238) is for cable services. Applicant denies the debt and \ncontacted the creditor.

He is usually able to \npay his monthly bills and sometimes his wife helps him out. He started a budget, but \nhas had difficulty keeping track of his expenses. He has not received financial \ncounseling. Applicant is trying to correct the financial mistakes of his past. He plans on \ncontinuing to pay all of his delinquent debts until they are all completely paid.24  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified on his behalf. She explained they both keep separate \naccounts. She helps her husband out financially when he has difficulty making some \npayments. She tries to help him manage his money. She provided him with a ledger to \nkeep track of his money. They do not have a written budget. Because they live in their \ntruck, they do not have housing costs. They each have a phone that they pay for. They \nshare their expenses incurred on the road. She has saved approximately $4,200 for an \nemergency. She has a security clearance. She has approximately $2,000 in delinquent \ndebts that are not paid. She admitted she does not pay careful attention to how much \nmoney is going into her account and how much is being deducted. She remembers \nApplicant attempting to maintain a budget, but he did not stick to it.25  \n \nApplicant did not provide proof that any of the debts in the SOR are paid, or that \nhe formally disputed them with the credit bureaus, although there are notations of a \ndispute on his credit report regarding one debt.

He is a patriotic person and solid \ncontributor to society.26 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n26 AE D. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nAppellant has a long history of being unwilling or unable to meet his financial \nobligations. He has debts that remain unpaid and delinquent. I find there is sufficient \nevidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because he has many delinquent debts that remain \nunpaid. Some of his debts date back to 2000, 2001, and 2002. Because the ongoing \nproblems are not isolated and there is no evidence to support a finding that the \ndelinquent indebtedness is unlikely to recur, the situation casts doubt on his reliability. \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant lost his wife in 1998, and spent money on legal fees pertaining to the \ncustody of his children. He also experienced periods of unemployment. These facts \nraise the application of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b). In order for that mitigating \ncondition to be fully applicable, Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant was the beneficiary of his late wife\u2019s life insurance. He did not \nuse the money to pay his bills. During this period he overextended himself with credit \ncards and did not pay them. He bought a new truck. After the money was exhausted, he \ndid not attempt to resolve the debts he incurred. It has been many years since some of \nhis debts were incurred. Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances. I \nfind mitigating condition (b) only partially applies. \n \n \nIn April 2009, Applicant began paying a monthly amount toward some delinquent \ndebts through Company A, a debt consolidation company. None of these debts are \nalleged in the SOR. Although Applicant stated he has provided Company A with his bills \nand any correspondence he may have received regarding his delinquent debts, he does \nnot know what debts are being addressed and when they will be resolved. He believes \nCompany A will include them in a future repayment plan. He believes Company A is \nusing a current credit report to address his debts. Applicant is making payments to \nCompany A and some of his delinquent debts are being resolved, but he does not have \na clear financial plan or understanding regarding his finances.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has participated in financial counseling. Although \nhe stated he has some type of budget he has not adhered to it. Some debts Applicant \ndisputes, but he did not provide documentary evidence to substantiate the basis of his \ndisputes. I did find Applicant credible in denying he was responsible for the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.i. However, he did not provide documentary evidence to support the actions he took \nto dispute this debt with the creditor. It is noted that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.f are reported as disputed on the credit report. I find AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to these \n\n \n10 \n \n \ndebts. There is some evidence that Applicant has made a good-faith effort to resolve \nsome of his delinquent debts, but he has left the responsibility for handling his \ndelinquent debts to Company A, without really understanding what specific debts are \nbeing addressed. I find AG \u00b6 20(d) only partially applies. There are not clear indications \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. It appears his repayment plan is for \ndelinquent debts that are not included on the SOR. I find mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(c) \ndoes not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2 were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant served \nin the Navy and was honorably discharged. He has begun to repay some of his \ndelinquent debts through a repayment plan, but the delinquent debts alleged on the \nSOR remain unresolved. Although he stated he sends his delinquent bills to Company A \nfor them to pay, he failed to show the current status of each of his delinquent debts. He \ndoes not have a list of what debts Company A intends on paying and when.  \n \nApplicant does not adhere to a budget and has not had financial counseling. At \nthis juncture, it does not appear Applicant has a grasp on all of his financial issues. He \nhas taken a good first step with Company A, but needs to take the next step in \nunderstanding all of his financial responsibilities and obligations. At this time, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under the guideline for Financial Considerations.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.g-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.u: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

The evidence shows\nApplicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties, which are ongoing. Applicant\nfailed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the security concerns raised by his\nhistory of financial problems. He did not give deliberately false answers to questions\nabout his finances in 2008, when he completed a security clearance application.\nAccordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nFebruary 7, 2011\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.    \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.7. \n2\n The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting documents, some\n3\nof which are identified as exhibits in this decision.  \n Exhibit 5. \n4\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on March 24,\n1\n2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guidelines\nknown as Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for personal conduct.\nThe SOR also recommended that the case be submitted to an administrative judge to\ndecide whether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR. Neither Applicant nor Department Counsel\nrequested a hearing, and so, the case will be decided on the written record.2\nOn or about June 10, 2010, the Agency submitted its written case consisting of\nall relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-called\n3\nfile of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant, but not received by him. It was\nagain mailed to Applicant on or about October 14, 2010, and received by him on or\nabout November 15, 2010. He then had a 30-day period to submit a response setting\nforth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation. To date, he has not\nreplied. The case was assigned to me January 11, 2011.  \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence. \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He married for the\nfirst time in 2006. He completed a security clearance application in July 2008.  In the\n4\napplication, he reported his then employment as a tool-control manger.

He reported two periods of unemployment. The first occurred during August\n5\n2000 to November 2001. The second occurred during December 2006 to March 2007.\nIn addition, his employment history includes military service in the U.S. Air Force\nReserve for several years ending in about 2007. \nApplicant was required to provide answers to various questions about his\nbackground when he completed the security clearance application. Those questions\nincluded inquiries about his financial record and financial delinquencies. In response to\na question about having been over 180 days delinquent on any debts in the last seven\nyears, he answered \u201cyes,\u201d and he reported two delinquent auto loans. He denied\ncurrently having any debts more than 90 days delinquent in response to another\nquestion. In his Answer to the SOR, he denied providing deliberately false answers to\nthese questions, explaining that he had no idea what he owed. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties that he does not\ndispute.  In his Answer to the SOR, he attributed the financial problems to youthful\n6\nimmaturity and inexperience with credit. He explained the origin of his financial\nproblems and his efforts to resolve them as follows:\nI in no way live out of my means now. When I was younger I was totally\ninexperienced with credit and did not think about consequences on my\nactions. I was making a lot of money at a very young age and did not take\ninto consideration that it may not last. The income did not last and I was\nnot able to pay for the items I acquired with credit. Now I am much more\nmature. I have been through experiences and learned a great deal. I know\nwhat it is like to have no job and no income for a period of time. I have\nmatured and realize how important paying things off is if I want to have a\nnice future for myself and my family. I started a good paying job in\nDecember 2008 and have been paying off large debts that I acquired\nwhen I was 20\u201322 years old. I have been working on this for the last year\nand three months. I could not do this in the past due to starting an entry\nposition job and paying bills like electric, oil for heat, rent, and serious\nneeds. I now make much more and focus all of my \u2018extra\u2019 funds on\nsatisfying my debts. I have not acquired any new debts. I still have debts\nin which I am currently paying off. I have worked on the larger debts and\nonce I get a smaller amount owed I plan on going to a bank for a loan in\nwhich I will pay off all remaining debts. This will help me build my credit\nback up while making one manageable payment a month. I realize that the\ninterest rate will be high but I need to start somewhere to clean my slate\nand make my credit better in my adult life.   \n7\n\n Exhibit 13. \n8\n E.g., Exhibit 7. \n9\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n10\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n11\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n12\n4\nIn addition, Applicant attributes some of his financial problems or difficulties to the 2005\nperiod, when he was deployed overseas with the Air Force and left bill paying to his\nthen girlfriend, who made only partial payments on an auto loan, resulting in\nrepossession.   \n8\nThe SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts ranging in amounts from $37 to $3,054 for\na total of approximately $19,500. The debts consist of collection or charged-off\naccounts. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the debts except for the debt\nin \u00b6 1.j, which he denied, asserting it had been paid. In addition, he stated that he had\none remaining payment to make on the debt in \u00b6 1.k. He also claimed to have paid eight\naccounts for approximately $46,490, although he did not include documentary proof to\nsupport his claim. \nApplicant has presented proof of payment for debts not alleged in the SOR.  But\n9\nhe has not presented any documentary evidence of efforts to repay, settle, or otherwise\nresolve the delinquent debts in the SOR. \nLaw and Policies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide\nif an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of\nDefense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously\nbecause it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our\noperations abroad. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n10\nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent\nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt\n11\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n12\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n13\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n14\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n16\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n17\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n18\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n19\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n20\n5\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n13\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n14\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n15\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n16\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n17\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.18\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.19\nThe AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nfor each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense\ndecision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. \nThe Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a\nperson a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it\n20\nis a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline E for personal conduct, the suitability of an applicant may be\nquestioned or put into doubt due to false statements and credible adverse information\nthat may not be enough to support action under any other guideline. The overall\nconcern under Guideline E is:  \n\n AG \u00b6 15. \n21\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n22\n See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that \u201cthe security suitability of an\n23\napplicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness\nor recurring financial difficulties.\u201d) (citation omitted). \n AG \u00b6 18.  \n24\n6\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n21\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An omission\nof relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about\nit, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported. \nThe issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to two questions about\nhis financial delinquencies on the 2008 security clearance application. Rather than\nanalyze each question and answer individually, it is appropriate to consider them\ntogether and analyze them based on the evidence as a whole. In doing so, the evidence\nshows Applicant reported two delinquent auto loans, but otherwise answered the\nquestions incorrectly as he failed to report the matters called for by the questions. He\nhas explained that he did so because he was unaware of what he then owed. His\nexplanation is not implausible and is generally consistent with an individual who is not in\ncontrol of his finances. I am persuaded that he did not have complete knowledge of his\nfinancial situation and this shortcoming resulted in his incorrect, but not deliberately\nfalse, answers to the questions. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided for Applicant. \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n22\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline\n23\nF is: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n24\n\n AG \u00b6 19(a).  \n25\n AG \u00b6 19(c). \n26\n AG \u00b6 19(e). \n27\n AG \u00b6 20(a)\u2013(f). \n28\n7\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the\ndefense industry.   \nThe evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\nproblems or difficulties, which are ongoing. This history raises security concerns\nbecause it indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not\n25\nmeeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient\n26\nto establish these two disqualifying conditions. In addition, by his own admission,\nApplicant engaged in a practice or pattern of consistent spending beyond his means.27\nUnder Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security concerns:28\n\u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n\u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\n\u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n\u00b6 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nOf those mitigating conditions, the most pertinent here are \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d). Each is\ndiscussed below. \n\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)\u2013(9).\n29\n8\nUnder \u00b6 20(b), it is probable that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused, in\npart, by his girlfriend\u2019s problematic bill paying in 2005 as well as his relatively brief\nperiod (four months) of unemployment during 2006\u20132007. These were circumstances\nlargely beyond his control. This is difficult to measure, however, because the\ncircumstances took place some years ago. Accordingly, this mitigating condition has\nlimited applicability. \nUnder \u00b6 20(d), Applicant has made some progress in repaying debts and\nprovided documentation to that end. Also, Applicant has a plan to resolve the remaining\nindebtedness by obtaining a bank loan. This plan is unrealistic, however, because it is\nunlikely that a loan officer at a bank or credit union would approve a debt-consolidation\nloan (unsecured, presumably) given Applicant\u2019s negative credit history. Lacking a\nrealistic plan, as well as any measurable progress in working a plan, this mitigating\ncondition has limited applicability. \nTo conclude, the evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems, past and present,\njustifies current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following\nEgan and the clearly-consistent standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting\nnational security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the whole-\nperson concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence. Nevertheless, Applicant did not\n29\nmeet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. At this\npoint, Applicant\u2019s suitability or fitness for a security clearance is a work in progress.\nTime will tell if Applicant has both the ability and willingness to resolve his financial\nproblems. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs). \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 12, 2010.  She filed an amended\nresponse on March 3, 2010, and asked for a hearing. The case was assigned to me on\nMay 18, 2010, and was scheduled for hearing on July 1, 2010.  A hearing was held on\nthe scheduled date. At the hearing, the Government's case consisted of 11 exhibits\nJuly 20, 2010\n\n2\n(GE).  All but one of the Government\u2019s exhibits (GE 11) were admitted pursuant to\nstipulation by the parties.  Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and six exhibits (AE).\nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on July 14, 2010. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) incurred two adverse judgments\n(subparagraphs 1.a and 1.s) in the respective amounts of $816 and $504; (b)\naccumulated 24 delinquent debts exceeding $21,000; and (c) has a personal financial\nstatement that reflects a minus $239 monthly net remainder after payment of expenses\nand debts. \nUnder Guidelines J and G, Applicant allegedly was arrested in March 2009 for\ndriving under the influence (DUI), pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to five years\nprobation, fined, ordered to pay $1,975 in restitution, required to serve five days in jail\nwith credit for one day served, referred to a work release program, and ordered to\nparticipate in a licensed alcohol educational program for three months or longer and\nattend an aftercare program for first offenders.  \nIn her February 2010 response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the\nallegations.  She repeated her admissions in her amended March 2010 response. \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31-year-old technical writer for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant moved to her current place of employment in 2003 with her then fianc\u00e9.\nIn 2004, she married her fianc\u00e9.  See GE 1.  They have no children.  See GE 1; Tr. 74.\nApplicant separated from her husband in 2008. Tr. 54. They have a separation\nagreement. Tr. 54, 71-72.\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nFollowing her separation, Applicant moved into a rental complex, which was\nsubsequently foreclosed.  As the result of the foreclosure, she was forced to vacate her\napartment without any return of her security deposit and last month\u2019s rent.  Tr. 36-37.\nBefore her move to her new apartment, she did not have very good credit.  Tr. 37-38. \nBetween February 2006 and February 2008, Applicant was either unemployed or\nworked at temporary jobs  for very low wages. Tr. 55-56.  She fell behind with her bills\nand experienced a worsening credit situation.  Tr. 57-58.  Two creditors (creditors 1.a\nand 1.s) obtained judgments against Applicant: one for $816 and the other for $504.\nSee GE 2, 3, and 11. Credit reports document Applicant\u2019s accumulating delinquent debts\n(exclusive of the two adverse judgments entered against her) exceeding $23,000. See\nGEs 2, 3, 9, and 11.  \n\n3\nSince returning to full time employment with her present employer, Applicant has\nrepaid over $5,000 of her delinquent debts, including her creditor 1.a judgment.  See\nAEs A and C.  Tr. 58-59.  Even though she continues to dispute most of her medical\ndebts (claiming they should have been covered by her medical insurance), she paid\nthem off.  Specifically, she documents paying creditors 1.e and 1.f, I.i through 1.k, 1.p\nthrough 1.r, and 1.t through 1.z. See AE C; Tr. 67-68. She continues to make payments\non some of her remaining debts (creditors 1.i through 1.o).  See AE C.  And she expects\nto begin payments on the few debts she has not taken any action on to date (i.e.,\ncreditors 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h).  Applicant  has a positive remainder every month.  She\npredicts she will be debt-free in two and one-half to three years (save for her student\nloan).  Tr. 63. \nApplicant identified two medical bills listed on the SOR that are duplicative\n(creditors covered by subparagraphs 1.g and 1.r). Tr. 40-41.  Her husband had promised\nto help Applicant with her old debts. Tr. 54.  But to date, he has not.  While some of the\nlisted debts are assigned to her ex-husband under their separation agreement, Applicant\naccepts full responsibility for all of them and is addressing them.  Tr. 54-55, 65-68, 71-\n74.  Several debts remain to be addressed.\nIn the personal financial statement Applicant completed in February 2009, she\nreported net monthly income of $2,420, net monthly expenses of $2,090, and monthly\ndebt payments of $560.  See GE 5. This left her with a minus monthly remainder of\n$239.  With the raise she received from her employer, she currently nets around $2,660\na month. AE B. \nApplicant has been able to reduce her monthly expenses to around $1,884, while\nincreasing her monthly debt payments slightly to $650 a month.  AE B.   Based on these\nchanges, Applicant has been able to achieve a positive net monthly remainder of\napproximately $34.  See AE B; Tr. 61-62.  \nApplicant\u2019s DUI incident\nIn March 2009, Applicant was arrested by local police and charged with DUI.  She\nhad attended a social event and consumed several drinks before she drove home.  Tr.\n48-49, 51-52.  Police administered a breathalyzer test at the scene, and she registered a\n.154 blood alcohol content (BAC) level on the test.  See GE 4. \nApplicant pleaded guilty to the 2009 DUI charge and was sentenced to five years\nprobation.  She was also fined, ordered to pay $1,975 in restitution, required to serve five\ndays in jail with credit for one day served, and referred to a work release program. And\nshe was ordered to participate in a licensed alcohol educational program for three\nmonths or longer and attend an aftercare program for first offenders.  GEs 4 and 6.  Tr.\n50.\nApplicant pays $100 a month on her court-ordered restitution, which is scheduled\nto run through 2014.  She has complied with all of the court\u2019s other conditions, and she\nrarely drinks anymore. Tr. 49-50. She consumed alcohol only on an occasional basis\n\n4\nbefore her 2009 DUI incident and has never been involved with law enforcement before\nor after her march 2009 incident.  Tr. 52. \nEndorsements\nApplicant is well-regarded by her supervisors and colleagues.  She documents\nnumerous credits for her contributions to her team\u2019s missions.  See AE D and F.\nColleagues who have had considerable experience working with her describe her as\nvery conscientious and trustworthy. They credit her with demonstrated courage,\nleadership, and outstanding performance in the execution of her assigned\nresponsibilities as a team leader.

These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the \"[c]onditions that\ncould mitigate security concerns.\u201d They must be considered before deciding whether or\nnot a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not\nrequire administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the\nguidelines is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6\n2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n\n5\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.  AG \u00b6 18.\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nAG \u00b6 21.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.  AG \u00b6 30.\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative\njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in\nlarge part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\nlogical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\n\n6\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a respected employee of a defense contractor who accumulated a\nnumber of delinquent debts during periods of unemployment and underemployment\nfollowing her move to her current location in 2003 with her fianc\u00e9.  She has been able to\nresolve most of her old debts and disputed the remaining ones.  \nBesides initial security concerns over Applicant\u2019s finances, some concerns are\nalso raised over her DUI incident in 2009.  She has since complied with the court\u2019s\nconditions and rarely drinks anymore. \nFinancial concerns\nApplicant\u2019s accumulated debt delinquencies warrant the application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guideline: DC \u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b619(c) \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s duties\nand access to classified information necessarily impose important duties of trust and\ncandor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those typically imposed\non government employees and contractors involved in other lines of government\nbusiness.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  Failure of the\napplicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve her debts when able to do so raises\nsecurity-significant concerns about the sufficiency of the applicant\u2019s demonstrated trust\nand judgment necessary to safeguard classified information.\nAddressing her listed debts, Applicant has repaid many of her debts (over $5,000\nin listed debts since she returned to full-time work in February 2008), and she is\ncommitted to repaying the remaining ones.  Her most recent credit report reflects deleted\naccounts on the debts she repaid (viz., creditors1.e and 1.f, I.i through 1.k, 1.p through\n1.r, and 1.u through 1.z) and ongoing payments on some of her listed debts (creditors\n1.1 through 1.o).  See AE C).  For those few remaining debts that she has not addressed\n(creditors 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h), she intends to pay them as well. \n\n7\n Applicant has a positive remainder every month, and she has shown\nconsiderable progress in payment of her debts since she returned to full time\nemployment two years ago.  She expects to be debt-free within two and one-half to three\nyears on all but her student loan debt. \nEvaluating all of her repayment efforts contextually, and given the difficult family\nand unemployment issues she has had to manage the past few years, Applicant may be\ncredited with serious, good-faith efforts to resolve her debts and regain control of her\nfinances. She has made considerable progress to date in regaining control of her\nfinances and shows good promise for fulfilling her remaining debt obligations.\nBased on her evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are sufficient to establish\nsignificant extenuating circumstances associated with her debt accumulations. As a\nresult, MC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation,\nand the individual acted responsibly),\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s repayment efforts entitle her to mitigation credit under both MC \u00b6\n20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts,\u201d and MC \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d These mitigating conditions have application to Applicant\u2019s\nsituation, considering her repayment efforts and credible reasons for disputing many of\nthe listed debts (mostly medical debts). \nIn  balance, Applicant has shown good faith in addressing her debts since she\nreturned to full-time employment with her current employer in 2008. And with her\nimproved financial situation (which includes a net monthly remainder), she demonstrates\nthat she is now firmly control of her finances and can be expected to stay current with\nher debts.\nBased on a whole-person assessment, Applicant surmounts the judgment\nquestions raised by her accumulation of two judgments and a host of other debts after\nshe relocated to her present state of residence, separated from her husband, and lost\nher full-time job. Her positive endorsements from her supervisors and co-worker and\nexcellent performance evaluations merit considerable praise and commendation. In\nbalance, she has shown sufficient tangible effort in addressing her major debts to\nmitigate her listed delinquent debts and demonstrate restored control over her finances. \nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources she has had to work with since her\nseparation, and her loss of work for an extended period (viz., 2006 through 2008) since\nher job dislocations, and the concerted steps she has mounted to address her debts\n(both her old ones and her current ones), safe predictive judgments can be made about\nher ability and intentions to repay her accrued debts and restore her finances to stable\n\n8\nlevels commensurate with her holding a security clearance. Favorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.aa. \nCriminal conduct and alcohol concerns\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrest alleged in the SOR raises important concerns\nabout her risk of recurrent alcohol abuse.  On the strength of the evidence presented,\none disqualifying condition (DC) of the AG for alcohol consumption (AG \u00b6 21) may be\napplied: DC \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while\nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d \nBecause the offense is classed as a criminal offense, it is covered by DC \u00b6 31(a)\nof the criminal conduct guideline as well: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses.\u201d  And because Applicant is still on probation, DC \u00b6 31(d), \u201cindividual is currently\non parole or probation,\u201d applies as well to her situation. Applicant\u2019s DUI offense would\nappear to qualify as a serious crime, but without a definition section in this guideline,  it is\nless than clear.\nDespite the seriousness of her March 2009 DUI offense, Applicant does not\nbelieve she is alcoholic and assures she was only an occasional drinker before the\nincident. Since her DUI incident she assures she has reduced her drinking even more.\nApplicant\u2019s assurances are quite credible and accepted.\nBased on the isolated nature of her alcohol-related offense, Applicant may rely on\none of the mitigating conditions of the alcohol guideline: MC \u00b6 22(a), \u201c so much time has\npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  MC \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d of the criminal conduct guideline also applies to\nApplicant\u2019s situation.\nTaking into account Applicant\u2019s very limited history of alcohol abuse (defined by\nher cited single alcohol-related incident), her strong work record, the applicable\nguidelines and a whole person assessment of her reduced alcohol consumption since\nher last and only DUI incident, conclusions warrant that her overall efforts reflect\nsufficient evidence of sustained commitment to responsible alcohol consumption to\nensure that she is not at any risk of recurrent alcohol abuse.  With no history of alcohol\nabuse before her DUI incident and renewed commitments to reducing her alcohol\nconsumption, she is a solid risk not to repeat any of the mistakes that contributed to her\n2009 DUI offense.\nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant makes a convincing showing that\nshe has the strength and stability to avert any recurrent problems with judgment lapses\nrelated to alcohol.  Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts are enough to warrant safe predictions\n\n9\nthat she is no longer at risk to judgment impairment associated with alcohol abuse.\nFavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by the criminal\nconduct and alcohol guidelines of the SOR. \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs.\nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):       FOR APPLICANT\nSubparas 1.a through 1.aa :\n          For Applicant\nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):           \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparas 2.a and 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubpara 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

Moreover, she \ndeliberately falsified her security clearance application. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 8, 2008, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. On \nJanuary 6, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as revised; and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 30, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted or denied. \n \nOn January 28, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 7, \n2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 15, 2010. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled on April 15, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, \nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits (AE) 1 \nthrough 4, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on April 23, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c-1.i, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n-\n1.q. At her hearing, she recanted her admissions and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.l, and 1.o. I \nconsidered these allegations denied. She also denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.j, 1.m, and 2.a. \nHer admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old software engineer employed by a defense contractor. \nShe is single and has no children. Shortly after graduating from high school, she \nenlisted in the U.S. Army where she served from 1987 until 2002. At the time of her \nhonorable discharge, she had achieved the pay grade of E-5. Her gross annual salary \nwas around $50,000. While in the Army, she attended college and completed an \nassociate\u2019s degree.  \n \nAfter her discharge from the Army, Applicant was unemployed and \nunderemployed for one year (March 2002-March 2003). She worked for a temporary \nemployment agency during approximately 70% of the year, and was unemployed 30% \nof the year. Her gross income was around $30,000 a year. She received unemployment \nbenefits while unemployed. In March 2003, she found a full-time job, where she worked \nfor approximately two years with a gross yearly salary of $51,000. She also joined the \nNational Guard where she served until March 2006. In the National Guard she earned \naround $200 a month for her weekend drills.  \n \nApplicant was activated and deployed to a combat zone in a Middle East country \nfrom March 2005 until her second honorable discharge in March 2006. Her gross \nannual salary was around $50,000. Pursuant to her military service, Applicant had \naccess to classified information at the secret level from 1987 until 1997, and at the top \nsecret level from 1997 until 2006. After her second discharge, Applicant was \nunemployed for approximately six months, and received unemployment benefits. Her \naccess to classified information was continued when she started working for her current \nemployer in June 2006. There is no evidence that Applicant has compromised or \ncaused others to compromise classified information. When she started working for her \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncurrent employer she was earning $52,000 gross annual pay. As of her hearing date, \nshe was earning around $62,000 in gross annual pay. She stated that after paying her \nday-to-day expenses and some debts, she has $370 of monthly discretionary income. \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. Section \n27 of the security clearance application asked Applicant whether in the last seven years \nshe had her wages garnished, any property repossessed, a lien placed against her for \nfailing to pay taxes or other debts, or any unpaid judgments. Section 28 asked Applicant \nwhether in the last seven years she had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts, \nand whether she was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts. Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to all the above financial questions.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation. It included \nthe review of September 2008 and May 2009 credit reports, which revealed the \njudgments and delinquent or charged off debts alleged in the SOR. In her response to \nDOHA financial interrogatories, Applicant claimed she did not disclose her judgments \nand delinquent debts in her 2008 security clearance application because she was \nunaware of some of the debts and others were not her debts. She also claimed she was \nin the process of disputing the validity of some of the debts and making settlement \narrangements on others. (GE 2)  \n \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent or charged off debts totaling $48,000, which \ninclude three judgments and one state tax lien.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($690), 1.h ($690), and 1.i ($674), allege judgments filed against \nApplicant in August 2002, January 2003, and February 2003, for unpaid rent. Applicant \nadmitted she rented an apartment from the creditor from 1999 until 2002. She explained \nthat when she was discharged from the Army, she was unemployed and her \nunemployment benefits were not sufficient for her to pay her rent. As of her hearing \ndate, these three judgments were unresolved. \n \nApplicant initially claimed she did not know about these debts and the judgments \nbecause she had not received any paperwork on the debts or judgments. She later \nadmitted knowing she had not paid the rent, but continued to claim she was not aware \nthe judgments had been filed against her. After she received DOHA\u2019s interrogatories, \nshe disputed these judgments via the credit bureaus. The judgments were verified as \nher valid judgments. (AE 3) She claimed she then attempted to contact the court about \nthe judgments, but was unsuccessful. She stated she intends to pay the judgments \nsome time in the future. She claimed she cannot address the judgments at this time \nbecause she is taking care of her student loans first and she does not have the financial \nmeans to address all debts at the same time.  \n \nAE 2 shows Applicant had two other judgments filed against her in January-\nFebruary 2005 for $585 and $1,263. She paid these judgments in late 2005.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.j allege the same ($29) delinquent debt to a utility company. \nApplicant disputed it via a credit bureau agency, allegedly because it was not her debt. \nIt was deleted from her credit report. (AE 3) She did not disclose this debt in her security \nclearance application because it was not her debt.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - 1.f allege Applicant\u2019s four student loans from 1999-2002, for a total \nof approximately $17,800. Applicant explained her student loans became delinquent in \n2005-2006, while she was deployed with the Army. She entered into a nine-month loan \nrehabilitation program and successfully completed it. At some undisclosed time, she \nagain became delinquent because she did not have sufficient income to pay the loans \nand her day-to-day living expenses. In May 2009, Applicant entered into a second loan \nrehabilitation program. Between May 2009 and March 2010, she made 14 payments of \n$185 pursuant to her loan rehabilitation agreement. (AE 1, 4) She testified she \nsuccessfully completed this rehabilitation program in March 2010. She has made no \npayments since then waiting for a new creditor to send her a bill. She believes her \npayments will start around May 2010. Applicant claimed she did not disclose her \ndelinquent student loans because at the time she submitted her security clearance \napplication she was participating in a loan rehabilitation program and her loans were \ncurrent.  \n \nApplicant bounced two checks she issued in October and December 2009, \npayable to the student loan rehabilitation program creditor. She claimed the October \ncheck bounced because she changed banks. The December check bounced because \nthe creditor presented the check for payment before the posted date. (Tr. 48) \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($627), 1.l ($2,193), \nand 1.o ($1,517). At her hearing, she denied SOR \u00b6 1.g because she never had an \naccount with that telephone service provider. Initially, she testified she had not disputed \nthe debt. (Tr. 50) Later, she testified she had disputed the debt and promised to provide \npost-hearing documentary evidence of her dispute. (Tr. 97) She also claimed that in \n2009, she attempted to contact the creditor, but the creditor never returned her calls. \nShe stated she did not disclose this debt in her security clearance application because it \nwas not her debt. This is Applicant\u2019s unresolved debt.  \n \nAt her hearing, she denied SOR \u00b6 1.l because it was not her account. She \ndisputed SOR \u00b6 1.l, and it was removed from her credit report. (AE 3) There are no \nexplanations as to why it was removed.  \n \nApplicant testified she does not know whether the credit card debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.o is her debt. Because it is not listed in her latest credit report (not presented \nas evidence), she has done nothing to address or resolve it. She presented no \ndocumentary evidence to show a reasonable basis for her alleged dispute. This is \nApplicant\u2019s unresolved debt. She stated that she did not disclose this debt in her \nsecurity clearance application because it was not her debt.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k ($1,030) and 1.n ($2,091) allege the same delinquent credit card \ndebt now in collection. Applicant admitted this was her credit card account, opened in \nJanuary 2000, which became delinquent in September 2002 (before she left the Army), \nbecause she could not afford to pay it. She claimed she settled the debt for $400 in \n2002. She presented no documentary evidence to support her claim. She did not \ndisclose this debt in her security clearance application because she claimed it was paid. \nAE 3 shows Applicant disputed this account in 2009 via a credit bureau. It was verified \nas Applicant\u2019s delinquent account. This is Applicant\u2019s unresolved debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($190) alleges a state tax lien filed against her in January 1990. \nApplicant claimed it was not her lien and that she disputed it. She claimed she had \ndocumentary evidence at home showing she disputed the debt and that it was removed. \nShe promised to submit the documentary evidence after her hearing. She failed to do \nso. She did not disclose this debt in her security clearance application because she \nclaimed it was not her debt. This is Applicant\u2019s unresolved debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p alleges a collection for $20,262 resulting from Applicant\u2019s \nrepossessed truck. She bought the truck in 1999 while in the Army. In 2002, she was \nunemployed and could not afford the payments and the truck was repossessed. She \nclaimed she was not billed for the remainder debt after the truck was sold until 2003, \nwhen she was contacted by the collection agency. At the time, she did not have the \nfinancial means to address the debt. She also claimed that in April-May 2009, she \nestablished a payment arrangement and made an undetermined number of $300 \npayments. She stopped making the payments because she could not afford them. She \nhas had no further contact with the creditor. Applicant claimed she did not disclose this \ndebt because she mistakenly believed it was outside of the seven-year period asked in \nthe security clearance application. This debt is unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.q alleges a collection for $571 resulting from cable TV services she \nreceived in 2002-2003. The debt has been delinquent since. Applicant has done nothing \nto resolve this debt. She failed to disclose this debt in her security clearance application. \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to her periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment. In January 2010, she considered participating in a debt payment and \nconsolidation program, but discarded the idea because of the required program fee and \nher belief that she can make the payments on her own. Applicant has not participated in \nfinancial counseling. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. They provide \nexplanations for each guideline and list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s goal is to achieve a \nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d1 Once the \nGovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden \nshifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment.2 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n1 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore \nthan a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d \n375, 380 (4 th Cir. 1994). \n \n2 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c-1.i, 1.k, 1.m-1.q are \nApplicant\u2019s debts as established by her testimony or the credit reports. She has a \nhistory of financial problems dating back to 1999. She has been unable or unwilling to \nresolve most of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR since she acquired them. AG \u00b6 \n19(a): \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two periods of unemployment and underemployment established \ncircumstances beyond her control, which contributed to her inability to pay her debts. I \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfind AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but does not fully mitigate the financial concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant has been consistently and fully employed since June 2006, \nearning at least $52,000 a year. Notwithstanding, except for making payments toward \nher student loans and disputing some of her debts, she presented little documentary \nevidence of good-faith efforts to pay, settle, or resolve her SOR delinquent debts. \n \nI note Applicant disputed all of her debts in 2009, including those she knew were \nher valid debts. The only documentary evidence presented of paid debts was the two \njudgments she paid in late 2005. Applicant is not in control of her financial situation and \ndoes not have a track record of financial responsibility. Because she has not \nparticipated in financial counseling, her financial problems are likely to continue. I find \nshe does not understand the importance of having and maintaining financial \nresponsibility. Her behavior shows lack of candor and reliability, and an unwillingness to \npay her debts. None of the mitigating circumstances apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts on her September 2008 security \nclearance application when she failed to disclose the debts and judgments alleged in \nthe SOR. She offers a variety of reasons for failing to disclose her financial difficulties. \nThese reasons do not account for all her delinquent accounts and ignore the fact that \nshe had to have known she had delinquent accounts the past that fell within the scope \nof the financial questions. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole, including her education, her years \nof military service and working for government contractors, the Government\u2019s expressed \nconcerns during her background investigation, the number and value of the debts, and \nher demeanor and conflicting testimony, her statement that her falsification was not \ndeliberate is not credible. \n \nHer behavior triggers the applicability of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 16(a): \n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits of status, determine \nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\u201d and \nAG \u00b6 16(e) \u201cpersonal conduct or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                           \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in \nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community \nstanding.\u201d  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could potentially mitigate the personal \nconduct security concerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find none apply. The only \nmitigating condition potentially applicable is AG \u00b6 17(a), but Applicant did not disclose \nher debts until after she was confronted. Applicant falsified her 2008 security clearance \napplication. Her falsification is a serious offense (felony-level),3 is relatively recent, and \ncasts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \n \n3 See 18 U.S.C. 1001. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis my comments on the analysis of Guidelines F and E. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant honorably served the \nUnited States for approximately 18 years. She has worked for a government contractor \nsince 2006, and possessed a security clearance for approximately 22 years. There is no \nevidence she has ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified \ninformation. These factors show some responsibility, good judgment, and mitigation. \nApplicant also established some circumstances beyond her control, which contributed to \nher inability to pay her debts.  \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. She presented insufficient documentary evidence \nof debt payments, contacts with creditors, negotiations to resolve her SOR debts, or of \nother efforts to resolve her debts. Because of her professional experience, she knew or \nshould have known of the Government\u2019s concerns about her finances during all the time \nshe possessed a security clearance. Applicant has not demonstrated she understands \nthe importance of having and maintaining financial responsibility. Moreover, Applicant \ndeliberately falsified her 2008 security clearance application when she failed to fully \ndisclose her financial problems. Her overall behavior shows lack of judgment, candor, \nand reliability, and an unwillingness to comply with the law.  \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.g-1i,   \n \n \n \n  1.k, 1.m-1.q: \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.f, 1.j,   \n \n \n \n  1.n, and 1.l:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006.\nJuly 15, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant submitted her answer to the SOR on March 3, 2009. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on March 20, 2009 for a hearing on April 6, 2009. The hearing was\nheld as scheduled. At the hearing, three exhibits (GE I through 3) were admitted in\nevidence without objection to support the government's case. Applicant testified and\nsubmitted four exhibits (AE A-AE D). Those exhibits have been re-labeled AE AA, AE\nBB, AE CC, and AE DD, to accommodate the identification system she employed in her\npost hearing exhibits. In her post hearing submissions, Applicant furnished AE A\nthrough AE Y (70 pages) on April 21, 2009. She submitted AE Z (4 pages) on April 22,\n2009. These exhibits, which have been received in evidence, provide updated\ninformation about several of the listed debts. The exhibits also include character\nstatements, her performance evaluations, and the preliminary documentation describing\nApplicant\u2019s enrollment in a debt consolidation plan. DOHA received the transcript on\nApril 10, 2009. The record closed on April 22, 2009.\nRulings on Procedure\nBefore opening statement of the hearing, Applicant was advised that because the\nnotice of hearing was dated March 20, 2009, and the hearing was beginning on April 6,\n2009, she may not have received the hearing notice more than 15 days before the\nhearing (as required by the E3.1.8. of the Directive), and could request a continuance\n(Tr. 10). Applicant answered that she had not received the notice of hearing more than\n15 days before the hearing (Tr. 7), and that she had not talked with Department\nCounsel for the Government by telephone more than 15 days before the hearing (Tr. 8).\nDepartment Counsel indicated he talked with Applicant on March 19, 2009, and she\nagreed to the hearing occurring on April 7 or April 8, 2009. The date was changed to\nApril 6, 2009 for administrative purposes. On March 25, 2009 (inside the 15-day period),\nDepartment Counsel advised Applicant of the change in hearing dates to April 6, 2009. \nApplicant considered (1) requesting a continuance or (2) proceeding with the\nhearing, then having two weeks after the hearing to submit additional documents\n(through Department Counsel) to substantiate action taken on the delinquent accounts\n(Tr. 11-14). Applicant decided to have the hearing, and then be allowed two weeks to\nsupplement the record (Tr. 13). The hearing was held as previously scheduled, and she\nwas granted until April 21, 2009 to produce additional documentation (Tr. 13, 77). By\nagreeing to proceed with the hearing and a two-week period of time to submit additional\nevidence, I conclude Applicant knowingly waived the 15-day notice requirement. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all 13 delinquent accounts appearing in the SOR. The total\namount of debt as of the date of the SOR was $34,107. Her answers are incorporated\ninto the following factual findings. \nApplicant is 38 years old and married. She has two children, ages 15 and three,\nand is expecting a third child. She served in the United States Army (USA) from 1988 to\nNovember 2000. She has held a security clearance since 1988.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s financial troubles began during the latter part of her military service\nbetween 1996 and 2000. Due to her husband\u2019s sporadic employment, she was the only\nsource of income for the family. After her honorable discharge in November 2000, she\nwas unable to find employment for about a year. When she found work in November\n2001, her husband lost his job, and was unemployed for approximately five years. He\nlanded a job 2005 with a publisher, where he is still working (Tr. 22-27). Applicant and\nher husband were separated between 2001 and 2003 (Tr. 68) when they reconciled.\nThey have been steadily employed since 2005 (Tr. 28).\nApplicant explained that her second child developed medical problems after his\nbirth in July 2005 (Tr. 29), including a heart condition that required hospitalization two\nweeks before the hearing (Tr. 59). After receiving a diagnosis of asthma at some time\nearlier in his life, the child was diagnosed with autism in February 2009 (Tr. 60, 73).\nBecause of the recent diagnosis and the difficulty identifying the proper treatment for\nautism, Applicant and her husband are uncertain what services the child will need, and\nhow much it will cost for increased medical insurance (Tr. 72-73). Even with their\ncurrent medical insurance, they have to pay about 10% of all medical costs for the\nfamily (Tr. 61). \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (GE 2, 3) provide historical background on the\npast due accounts listed the SOR. The delinquent accounts shall be addressed in the\norder they appear in the SOR. \n\u00bb SOR 1.a. $3,717, credit card, judgment received by creditor in June 2004.\nApplicant was making payments in 2003 and 2004 on the delinquent account before it\nbecame a judgment, but no payments were made since March 2004 (AE A1, at 7). The\njudgment is currently $5,069, and will be included in Applicant\u2019s debt consolidation plan\n(AE A, N). \n\u00bb SOR 1.b. $696, medical account for services rendered to her second child in\nAugust 2005. The account became delinquent in December 2005. Applicant tried\nseveral times between April 15 and April 21, 2009 to obtain a current account balance,\nbut she received nothing. The creditor has offered a settlement of SOR 1.b., 1.k., and\n1.l. for $692. The settlement amount will be included in Applicant\u2019s debt plan (AE A, N).\nSee also discussion under SOR 1.k.\n\u00bb SOR 1.c. $348, credit card account opened in August 2002, and became\ndelinquent in May 2004. Applicant provided documentation that she made a payment of\n$114 on January 20, 2009, and a payment of $114 on March 6, 2009 to pay off account.\nShe is awaiting documentation from the creditor to reflect the account is paid. AE AA\nindicates that on January 13, 2009, the collection firm made an offer to Applicant to\nprovide two payments of $104 by February 20, 2009 to settle the account.\n\u00bb SOR 1.d. $5,010, credit card account opened in May 2001, and became\ndelinquent in December 2003. The account was sold to a collection agency. Applicant\nhas made two payments under a repayment plan established with the collection agency\n\n4\nin March 2009 (AE D1). Applicant made the first payment of $591 on March 9, 2009 (AE\nD2), and the second payment of $591 on April 20, 2009 (AE D3). \n\u00bb SOR 1.e. $1,644, unknown loan instrument that was opened in January 1999,\nand became delinquent in September 2003. On October 30, 2008, Applicant settled this\naccount for $1,110 (AE E2).\n\u00bb SOR 1.f. $16,104, credit card account opened in March 1997, and became\ndelinquent in September 2001. The account was sold to a collection firm that presented\nan offer to settle in 2008 of $5,199. This offer is verified by the firm\u2019s December 2008\nacknowledgment of receiving Applicant\u2019s final payment under a repayment plan (AE\nDD). Under the plan, Applicant settled the account in three installments of $1,733 made\non: October 31, 2008 (AE F1); November 21, 2008 (AE F2); and, December 12, 2008\n(AE F3). Applicant received a letter on April 21, 2009 indicating the account was\nsatisfied for $5,199 (AE F3). \n\u00bb SOR 1.g. $1,704, credit card account opened in May 1997, and became\ndelinquent in August 2003. This account will be added to Applicant\u2019s debt consolidation\nplan (AE A). \n\u00bb SOR 1.h. $2,484, credit card account opened in May 1997, and became\ndelinquent in March 2001. This account will be added to Applicant\u2019s debt consolidation\nplan (AE A, N).\n\u00bb SOR 1.i. $53.00, medical account (dental) for services rendered in September\n2006. On April 20, 2009, Applicant paid the account. There is no documentation from\ncreditor indicating the account was paid, however, she provided a check ledger\nreflecting a payment of $57 to a dental firm (AE I1). \n\u00bb SOR 1.j. $697, unknown credit account that became delinquent in June 2007.\nThe account was transferred to several collection agencies (AE A). Applicant settled the\naccount in April 2009 for $205 (AE J2, J3), and verification from the collection agency is\npending (AE A).\n\u00bb SOR 1.k. $864, medical account for services rendered on March 2006.\nAlthough Applicant testified that this was the same account as SOR 1.b., she was\napparently mistaken (AE A). Applicant stated that the creditor has notified her the three\nmedical accounts (SOR 1.b., 1.k., and 1.l.) can be settled for $692. After numerous\nattempts to contact the creditor, Applicant will include the consolidated settlement\namount in her debt consolidation plan (Id.).\n\u00bb SOR 1.l. $531, medical account for services rendered February 2006. The\nconsolidated settlement amount of $692 will be in her debt plan (AE N). \n\n5\n\u00bb SOR 1.m. $255, a medical account for services provided on January 2007.\nApplicant claims she paid the account, but provided no proof of payment as she had\nwith SOR 1.c. and 1.d.\nAE N provides some details of Applicant\u2019s debt plan enrolled in on April 19, 2009.\nAfter paying the enrollment fee of $50, her first payment of $460 is due May 10, 2009.\nAs disclosed on page one of the plan, Applicant was advised to implement certain\naction steps in her financial practices. The debt consolidation firm recommended that\nshe establish a budget, use coupons to make food purchases, and purchase certain\nmerchandise at stores where the prices are generally lower. The firm also advised to\nopen a savings account and deposit 10% of her net monthly income. \nHaving carefully evaluated the evidence, specifically the character statements\nand Applicant\u2019s demeanor at the hearing, I find her testimony credible. Based on the\ndocumentation Applicant provided to show payments or settlements of six accounts and\npartial payments of two of the 13 past due accounts (including one judgment), I find\nApplicant paid off, settled, or furnished payments to SOR 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.i. In\naddition, based on her testimony and documentation relating to SOR 1.j., I find her\nclaim that she also paid the account in SOR 1.j. is credible, even though there is no\ndocumentary verification of settlement. Since October 2008, Applicant has paid a total\nof $7,931 and still owes $9,953 to the creditors listed in SOR 1.a., 1.g., and 1.h. She will\ninclude those creditors in her debt plan, along with the consolidated settlement offer of\n$692 (three medical accounts identified in SOR 1.b., 1.k., and 1.l.) into her debt plan.\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations from 2004 disclose she has consistently\nexceeded requirements of her position as help desk manager in computer systems. She\nreceived a performance award in 2008 (AE O). Several coworkers indicate Applicant is\na dedicated employee who has always been a team player (AE T through AE X). Her\nExecutive Assistant has seen nothing but dedication in the way Applicant has carried\nout her job responsibilities in the last two \u00bd years (AE Y), while her supervisor since\n2005 considers her a real leader (AE Z). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). Each\nguideline lists potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are flexible rules of law that must take into consideration the complexities of\nhuman behavior. \nThe administrative judge's ultimate adjudicative goal is to reach a fair and\nimpartial decision that is based on common sense. The decision should also include a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person\n\n6\nconcept.\" Finally, the Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to the potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n\u00b6 18. The Concern. \"Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\"\nApplicant encountered financial problems as she approached retirement from the\nmilitary in November 2000. After her honorable discharge, she did not find employment\nuntil November 2001. Her husband was unemployed at the time of her discharge, and\ndid not regain full-time employment until 2005. The accounts listed in the SOR show\n\n7\nthat some of the debts became delinquent in 2003 and 2004, but others (primarily the\nmedical debts for her second child) became delinquent in 2005 through 2007. Both FC\ndisqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC\nDC \u00b6 19.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) apply to the circumstances of this\ncase. \nThe first four mitigating conditions are potentially applicable. Applicant is entitled\nto limited mitigation under FC mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 20.a. (the behavior happened\nso long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and good\njudgment). Although a few of the 13 accounts became delinquent in the last three years,\nher outstanding character evidence and her proactive approach to her overdue debt\nobligations before receiving the SOR in February or March 2009, overcomes any\npreviously existing doubt regarding her judgment and reliability. \nFC MC \u00b6 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances) applies to the five-year-period when Applicant\u2019s husband was\nunemployed, and she had to pay the family bills on her income exclusively. Applicant\nreceives additional mitigation under this mitigating condition with the discovery of her\nsecond child\u2019s health problems, including asthma, and more recently, autism.\nApplicant\u2019s resolution of several of the debts before receiving the SOR constitutes\ncompelling evidence that she has acted responsibly under challenging circumstances. \nAppellant needs additional financial counseling as defined by FC MC \u00b6 20.c. (the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). However, her\nprogress in paying off and paying on two of the overdue accounts demonstrates she is\nregaining control of her financial responsibilities.  \nApplicant receives substantial consideration under FC MC \u00b6 20.d. (the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nBefore October 2008, she owed more than $34,000. Currently, she owes about $9,953.\nAll past due debts, including the judgment, are being paid on or a part of a repayment\nplan, or will be in her debt consolidation plan. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the FC guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors:\n\u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n8\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems between 2000 and 2005 are extenuated by her\nunemployment for most of 2001, her husband\u2019s unemployment between 2000 and\n2005, and their separation from 2001 to 2003. Even though they have been steadily\nemployed since 2005, their son\u2019s health problems have understandably caused financial\nchallenges. \nApplicant exercised good judgment by acting on several of the family debts in\nOctober 2008, approximately five months before the SOR was issued in February 2009.\nBy settling the largest delinquent account (SOR 1.f., $16,104) in three payments\nbetween October and December 2008, she reduced her delinquent balance to\napproximately $18,000. Her payments on the other accounts reduced the delinquent\nbalance to about $10,000 for the remaining four accounts that will be placed in her debt\nconsolidation plan. Based on her favorable action taken since October 2008 to eliminate\na substantial portion of her debt, I am convinced she will follow through with her\npromises to pay the remaining delinquent accounts including those that will be in her\ndebt consolidation plan, even though she established the plan after the hearing, and\nhas paid only the enrollment fee required by the plan. With one child in poor health, and\nexpecting a third child, Applicant realizes she is duty bound to make responsible\nchanges in her financial practices. I am convinced she will show the same dedication to\nher debt consolidation plan as she has demonstrated to her colleagues over the last\neight years. The financial guideline is found in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant has paid most of the \ndebts and has rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under financial \nconsiderations. Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n1 \nMarch 19, 2010\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on May 29, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n  \n \nOn June 18, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nJuly 15, 2009, I was assigned the case. On July 27, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing which was held on August 24, 2009.  \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were admitted into \nevidence. Four individuals testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Exhibits A through P, which were admitted into evidence. The \nrecord was held open to allow additional information from Applicant. On September 3, \n2009, additional material was submitted. Department Counsel had no objection to the \nmaterial, which was admitted into the record as Ex. Q and R. On January 19, 2010, \nadditional material was submitted. Department Counsel had no objection to the \nmaterial, which was admitted into the record as Ex. S through W. On March 1, 2010, \nadditional material was submitted. Department Counsel had no objection to the \nmaterial, which was admitted into the record as Ex. X through UU. On September 1, \n2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. \n \nProcedural \n \n \nAt the start of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR. There \nbeing no objection, the following changes were made: SOR \u00b6 1.d was amended by \nadding the words \u201cin the amount of $2,554\u201d; \u00b6 1.e was amended by adding the words \u201cin \nthe amount of $202\u201d; and, \u00b6 1.j was amended deleting the word \u201cTexas\u201d and replacing it \nwith the word \u201cUtah.\u201d (Tr. 20-22) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admitted all of the factual allegations, with \nexplanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. \nAfter a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old information technology (IT) technician and help desk \nanalysts who has worked for a defense contractor since August 2008, and is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance. (Tr. 119) Applicant\u2019s co-workers, supervisors, and friends \nstate: Applicant is hard working, intelligent, dedicated, compassionate, honest, and \ntrustworthy. He places the value of his employer and work assignment at the same level \nas his personal wants and needs. (Ex. A, B, F) He has tenacity, a positive attitude, and \nis an effective team builder who creates a positive work environment. (Ex. C) Applicant \nis a solid, dedicated, determined person who serves as a role model for his children and \nassociates. (Ex. D, E, G) Applicant is \u201ca man of quiet confidence with a desire to \nsucceed.\u201d (Ex. H) He has received a certificate of recognition and appreciation for his \nduty performance from September 2000 to June 2003. (Ex. P) \n \n2 \n\nAt his home group 12-step program, Applicant provides substance when relating \nhis past mistakes and hardships. (Tr. 40) Applicant knows how important it is to make \namends for his shortcomings concerning his finances. (Tr. 41) Applicant is serious \nabout correcting his financial problems. (Tr. 45) A month prior the hearing, Applicant \nreceived assistance from his church to pay a $215 electrical utility bill. (Tr. 51, 52) \nApplicant\u2019s pastor believes Applicant will follow through on promises made. (Tr. 57) His \nchurch has a detailed program addressing financial problems and providing financial \ncounseling. However, Applicant had yet to start the counseling. (Tr. 55, 199) In his June \n2009, response to the SOR, Applicant stated he would enroll in a personal finance \ncourse offered by the local community college and provided a copy of the course \nsyllabus. He never enrolled.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sponsor in a 12-step program believes Applicant is sincere, hard \nworking, responsible, and focused. (Tr. 66, 85) His sponsor states Applicant has a firm \nresolve to satisfy his debts as quickly as possible. (Tr. 71) Applicant\u2019s father said there \nis property from an estate, a home, which is being sold. When it sells, Applicant\u2019s \nportions would be at least $15,000. (Ex. L, M, N, Tr. 98, 114) the house was just being \nput on the market. (Tr. 100) In the past, his father has given him $1,500 twice. (Tr. 106)  \n \nIn August 2003, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. \nIn August 2004, the bankruptcy was discharged. In 2003 or 2003, Applicant was \nworking in the IT field making twice what other employees at the company were making. \n(Tr. 187) Instead of firing him, his pay was cut. (Tr. 187)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted four pages of his Chapter 7 Schedule F, a list of creditors \nholding unsecured nonpriority claims. The total unsecured debt as listed on page 3 was \n$51,998.65, however, the four pages add up to only $47,752.65 a difference of $4,246. \nNo explanation was provided for the missing creditors. A page may be missing from the \nSchedule F. The schedule lists six medical debts: three hospital debts ($2,525, $2,003, \nand $858); a neonatal associates\u2019 debt ($443); and two credit services related to \nmedical ($63 and $858). The SOR lists two medically related judgments: a $2,554 \njudgment (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and a $202 dental bill judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Two other medical \naccounts are also listed in the SOR: a $452 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and a $437 debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.l).  \n \n \nApplicant asserts he will check the SOR debts against his bankruptcy to \ndetermine if any of the SOR debts were included in the bankruptcy. In March 2010, \nApplicant asserted, but failed to provide documentation, that the $665 credit card debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.m) was included in his bankruptcy. (Ex. X) \n \n \nApplicant asserts, but fails to document, that the three accounts placed for \ncollection in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($681), SOR \u00b6 1.h ($369), and SOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,083) are \nduplications of the same debt. Applicant\u2019s May 2009 credit bureau report (Ex. 3) lists the \nsame firm and identification code for the three debts, which means a single collection \nfirm is attempting to collect the three debts. The $1,048 debt is a bank credit card \n3 \n\naccount, the $369 debt is past due electric and power utility bill, and the $665 is the \nsame debt as listed in (SOR \u00b6 1.m). (Ex. 3, 4)  \n \nIn October 1989, a $226 state tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1. j) was filed against him, which \nhis mother paid. Court records show the lien was satisfied in 1989. (Ex. U) A $2,554 \njudgment (SOR \u00b6 1.d) was filed against Applicant by a medical provider. A dentist \nobtained a $202 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.e) against him. (Ex. 2) \n \nApplicant and his wife have five children. (Tr. 72, 120) His wife makes $11 per \nhour working at a grocery store. (Ex. J, K) He is paid $24 per hour at his job and \ncontributes two percent of this salary to a savings plan. (Ex. J, R) He currently has \n$1,700 in the plan. (Ex. R) He obtained a part-time job working at a restaurant to help \npay his debts, which paid $10 per hour. (Ex. 2) At the time of the hearing, he no longer \nhad his part-time job. (Tr. 125) His annual salary is $50,000 per year. (Tr. 185) His \nmonthly income was $3,500 and his wife\u2019s monthly income was $800. (Tr. 160) \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly discretionary income (gross income less expenses and bill \npayment) is $20 to $30 each month. (Tr. 170)  \n \nApplicant drives a 1995 Honda. (Tr. 215) When he gets home from work, he \ntakes his wife to her evening job at the supermarket and returns four hours later to pick \nher up. (Tr. 216) His current job is the first job that provided him and his family medical \ncoverage. (Tr. 220) \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant was interviewed about his finances. (Tr. 141) On \nMarch 31, 2009, Applicant answered written interrogatories. (Ex. 2) At that time, \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income was $4,146; his monthly expenses were $3,945, which \nincluded payment of $173 to a credit solution company, which left a net monthly \nremainder of $28. However, Applicant did not make any payments to the credit solution \ncompany. (Tr. 130)  \n \nIn September 2008, when questioned about his finances, Applicant stated his \nfinancial situation was the result of his own financial irresponsibility and was not caused \nby events beyond his control. (Ex. 2) He planned to enroll in the employee assistance \nprogram offered by his employer and seek credit counseling and debt consolidation \nservice assistance. (Ex. 2) Much of his debt is five years old, and he went to the debt \nconsolidation company six months prior to or before the hearing. (Tr. 148)  \nOn March 31, 2009, Applicant sought the services of a credit solutions company \nto help him with his debt and completed an enrollment package. (Tr. 2) This was \nthrough his company\u2019s emergency assistance program (EAP). (Tr. 113) The plan \ncovered seven debts, which totaled $9,682 and required Applicant to make $174 \nmonthly payments. (Ex. 2) The covered debts include: a $2,554 judgment by a medical \ncreditor (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a $1,607 credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g); miscellaneous medical bill, \nthe $202 judgment by a medical creditor (\u00b6 1.e); the collection agency attempting to \ncollect a $1,083 credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i); a $665 credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.m); and, \na $217 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.n).  \n \n4 \n\nThe plan also includes a $1,024 credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.i, $1,083) debt. Applicant\u2019s \nSeptember 13, 2008 credit bureau report (CBR) (Ex. 4) lists the original creditor with a \nhigh credit of $1,024, but the CBR indicates the debt was sold to another creditor. The \nsame CBR lists a $1,024 high credit amount listed under the collection agency \nreferenced in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i. \n \nThe agreement required Applicant to pay $174 each month for April, May, and \nJune 2009. Starting in July 2009, he was required to pay the credit solutions company \n$72 monthly. (Ex. 2) There is no evidence Applicant has made any payments in accord \nof this agreement. Applicant states shortly after entering into the agreement his second \njob ended and he made no payments. (Tr. 150) Applicant completed a debt \nmanagement worksheet with a different company. (Ex I) Applicant\u2019s monthly net \nremainder (income less expenses) was $28. (Ex. I, Tr. 113) \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of alcohol contributed to his financial problems. Applicant stated, \n\u201cI suffer from the disease of alcoholism. When I drink, unfortunately, the majority of my \nmoney goes to that. That\u2019s how the debt occurred.\u201d (Tr. 155) In the past, alcohol \nconsumption has been a problem for Applicant, but he is active in recovery. He last \ndrank in October 2008. (Tr. 158) In 1989, Applicant was in a seven-day detoxification \nand treatment program. Followed by a 30-day inpatient program during which he \nattended counseling and received education. He entered the program as a requirement \nfor his parent\u2019s bailing him out of jail. In February 2007, he entered into a seven-day \ninpatient program. (Ex. 2) He admitted himself because he wanted to stop drinking and \ncould not stop by himself. Applicant describes the 2007 treatment as \u201cactive addiction\u201d \nnot \u201cactive recovery.\u201d (Tr. 159) He states that it was not until last year that the actual \ntrue recovery process started. (Tr. 207)  \n \nAt the end of 2009, Applicant\u2019s sister sent him $7,000 with which to pay his \ndebts. (Ex. S) He failed to explain why he needed to borrow $7,000 from his sister \nwhen, at the hearing he had asserted he would \u201csoon\u201d receive an inheritance of \n$17,552. (Answer to SOR) As of January 10, 2010, Applicant has received offers to \nsettle from some of his creditors. He was attempting to negotiate with other creditors to \nlower the amount owed and was attempting to locate the remaining creditors. On March \n1, 2010, Applicant provided documentation that he had paid approximately $4,300 on \nhis debts. (Ex. X \u2013 UU) The use of the balance of the $7,000 is not part of the record. \n \nApplicant has been through financial credit counseling several times. One period \nof counseling that lasted six months, one that had seven sessions, and counseling that \nlasted a year. (Tr. 193) He learned to live within his means, to scale back spending, \nestablish a budget, and accumulate savings. A summary of his 15 debts and their \ncurrent status follows:  \n \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount Current Status \na Apartment complex debt placed \nfor collection. \n$426 \nPaid. Settled for $385. (Ex.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail or safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n8 \n\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. In 2004, Applicant had $52,000 of debt discharged. The SOR lists two unpaid \njudgments, a state tax lien, and twelve additional accounts placed for collection, which \ntogether totaled approximately $10,500. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nor unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n9 \n\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; or \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence because he had two large delinquent debts from \nNovember 2008 until December 2009. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant \ndoes not receive credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because the debts are recent and numerous.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. September 2008, when questioned about his \nfinances, Applicant stated his financial situation was the result of his own financial \nirresponsibility and was not caused by events beyond his control. He also stated his use \nof alcohol contributed to his financial problems. Applicant stated, \u201cI suffer from the \ndisease of alcoholism. When I drink, unfortunately, the majority of my money goes to \nthat. That\u2019s how the debt occurred.\u201d In the past, alcohol consumption has been a \nproblem for Applicant, but he is active in recovery. He last drank in October 2008. Under \nAG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant=s financial problems were not contributed to by factors beyond his \ncontrol. Applicant meets none of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20(b) such as loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because Applicant had yet to start financial \ncounseling. AG \u00b6 20(d) does apply. Applicant has paid eight of his debts, which \nindicates a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAnother account placed for collection was included in his bankruptcy. Those debts total \napproximately $5,500. Applicant asserts, but fails to provide documentation that four \nadditional debts have been addressed. He asserts, without documentation, that the \n$202 dentist bill (SOR 1.e) was paid; the $437 medical debt (SOR 1.l) was a duplication \nof another debt; the $665 credit card debt (SOR 1.m) was included in his bankruptcy; \nand the creditor had agreed to remove the $670 bank debt placed for collection (SOR \n1.b) from his CBR. \n \nApplicant has agreed to pay the remaining two debts ($452, SOR 1.c and \n$2,554, SOR 1.d). Having paid the majority of his debts coupled with the character \nreferences provided attesting to Applicant\u2019s good character, it is likely he will pay the \ntwo remaining debts, which total approximately $3,000. \n \n10 \n\nNeither the remaining unpaid debt, nor his having to have resorted to bankruptcy \nprotection raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The debts incurred were \nnot the type that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide \nby rules and regulations. Applicant has paid the majority of his debts. Of course, the \nissue is not simply whether all his debts are paid\u2014it is whether his financial \ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & \n2(a)(1).)  \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted \nthat the concept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an \napplicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid \noff each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has \u2018. . . established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2 (a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the \n11 \n\n12 \n                                                          \npayment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement \nthat the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan \nbe the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations \nomitted).  \n \nApplicant understands he needs to maintain his financial responsibility. Clearly, \nhe could have acted more aggressively to resolve his debts. There is, however, simply \nno reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of \ndebt payments. He has promised to pay the two remaining debts.2 I found his hearing \nstatement to be candid, forthright, and credible. His character witnesses laud his \nresponsibility, trustworthiness, and integrity.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u20131.p: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n2 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit reports, \ninvestigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the government \nfrom subsequently revoking it, if warranted. This footnote does not imply that this clearance is conditional. \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old physical security officer employed by a defense agency. He is single, and has never been married. He has four children, ages 14, 11, 10, and 7, apparently from three different mothers (GE 1). He is under a court order requiring him to make payments to the state\u2019s child support enforcement system for his two younger children, apparently from the same mother. He has had his wages garnished since May 2000 to cover his child support obligations (GE 1, \u00a7 27). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f alleged child support arrearages totaling approximately $12,700. Applicant explained he fell behind on his child support obligations because of his periods of unemployment and underemployment (Tr. 66). 1 On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. 3 The oldest child\u2019s mother never required Applicant to provide consistent child support.

On March 25, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges a security concern \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn April 14, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 3, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 12, 2009. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on June 26, 2009. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \npresented the testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 \nthrough 3, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on July 7, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nApplicant received 15 days advance notice of the date of his hearing. \nDepartment counsel telephonically contacted Applicant in June 2009 to ascertain a \nconvenient date to schedule Applicant\u2019s hearing. Applicant chose to have his hearing on \nJuly 26, 2009. At his hearing, Applicant indicated he had sufficient time to prepare for \nhis hearing, and that he was ready to proceed (Tr. 20-22). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old physical security officer employed by a defense \nagency. He is single, and has never been married. He has four children, ages 14, 11, \n10, and 7, apparently from three different mothers (GE 1). He is under a court order \nrequiring him to make payments to the state\u2019s child support enforcement system for his \ntwo younger children, apparently from the same mother. He has had his wages \ngarnished since May 2000 to cover his child support obligations (GE 1, \u00a7 27). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e and 1.f alleged child support arrearages totaling approximately $12,700. Applicant \nexplained he fell behind on his child support obligations because of his periods of \nunemployment and underemployment (Tr. 66).  \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations \nmade under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nProgram (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, \n2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe oldest child\u2019s mother never required Applicant to provide consistent child \nsupport. Applicant testified he provides his oldest child\u2019s mother with some money \noccasionally when they see each other (Tr. 67). The second oldest child lives with \nApplicant\u2019s parents. Applicant did not state whether he contributes financially to the \nchild\u2019s upbringing.  \n \nApplicant started having financial problems in the 1990s (Tr. 60). He attributed \nhis current financial problems to three main causes: his level of education, his inability \nto find a good paying job, and his periods of unemployment and underemployment. \nBecause of his limited income, he could not afford to pay both his past financial \nobligations and his day-to-day living expenses.  \n \nApplicant attended college from June 2005 to April 2007, and completed an \nassociate\u2019s degree in criminal justice. He worked part-time while attending college (Tr. \n58). He paid for his education by taking six student loans (alleged under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i \nthrough 1.n), and owes approximately $27,316 (AE 1). In April 2009, Applicant \nconsolidated his six student loans under an income contingent repayment plan (AE 1). \nIn June 2009, his consolidated student loan repayment plan was deferred until \nNovember 2009, because he was unemployed.  \n \nApplicant was employed during the following periods: from August 2001 to April \n2002 (night stocker); June 2002 to March 2003 (platform assembler); March 2003 to \nJune 2005 (ink jet operator); February 2006 to February 2007 (retail salesman); \nDecember 2007 to April 2008 (production worker); and from August to April 2009 \n(security guard). He has been employed by a government contractor since early May \n2009. \n \nHe was unemployed from April 2002 to June 2006; from May 2005 to February \n2006; from February 2007 to December 2007 (He was fired from his job for failure to \nfollow a safety regulation that required him to use dangerous machinery with a spotter \n(GE 1, \u00a7 22).); from April 8 to August 2008; and during approximately two weeks during \nApril 2009. Applicant received interim access to classified information in August 2008. \nHis interim access was terminated in April 2009, because of the pending SOR and his \nfinancial problems. When his interim access was terminated, Applicant was laid off. \nApplicant started working for a government contractor approximately two weeks after he \nwas laid off. Applicant received unemployment benefits when unemployed.  \n \nIn his August 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed having his \nwages garnished to cover his child support obligations and that he had financial \nproblems. His background investigation addressed his financial status and included the \nreview of August 2008, September 2008, and March 2009 credit bureau reports (CBRs), \nand Applicant\u2019s security clearance application.  \n \nThe SOR alleges 16 delinquent and/or charged off accounts, totaling \napproximately $39,000, which have been delinquent for a number of years. In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admitted these were his debts and that they are \n\n \n4 \n \n \noutstanding. The debts are also established by the admitted CBRs. Seven of the \nalleged delinquent debts can be considered as small debts since they are for less than \n$500.  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant presented the testimony of his younger brother. He has \nworked for over four years as a security guard for a government agency and possesses \na secret level clearance (Tr. 37). He also works part-time for government contractors as \na security guard. Applicant and his brother lived together from January 2007 to March \n2009. They have always had close personal contact. They have worked for the same \ngovernment agency from August 2008 to April 2009. Applicant is considered to be a \nvery good guy. Applicant attended college because he wants to help the youth and \nmake a better life for himself and his family. Applicant did not discuss his financial \nproblems with his brother or seek his brother\u2019s financial counseling or assistance. \nApplicant\u2019s brother recommended Applicant receive access to classified information. In \nhis opinion, Applicant\u2019s work and professionalism have been above reproach. Applicant \nconsiders himself to be a valuable employee.  \n \nApplicant has not participated in any financial counseling (Tr. 64-65). He claimed \nhe visited a debt consolidation company around February-April 2009. However, he did \nnot follow up on the debt consolidation program, and he has done nothing about it since \nthen. Applicant failed to submit a working budget, evidence of lifestyle changes, or a \nplan to resolve his ongoing financial problems. Applicant participated in a background \ninterview around July-August 2008 (Tr. 86). He was advised then by the investigator to \nresolve his financial problems. He was hired by a government agency in August 2008, \nand held his job until April 2009. Except for consolidating his student loans, Applicant \npresented no documentation showing he had paid, properly disputed, or made any \nefforts to contact his creditors in an attempt to resolve any of his other debts. Applicant \nis not aware of what is required of him to show that he is reliable, trustworthy, and \nfinancially responsible. \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his financial problems. He claimed he was not \ndeliberately ignoring his financial obligations, and that he was making efforts to resolve \nhis financial problems. He failed to present evidence of such efforts. Applicant also \nstated he was just trying to stay afloat paying his bills, paying his girlfriend\u2019s bills, and \npaying back his girlfriend and his father\u2019s loans.  \n \nApplicant highlighted that he served well a government agency during the last \nseven months. He believes that because of his job performance and education, his \nfinancial problems do not make him a security risk or concern. There is no evidence that \nApplicant ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified information. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \n2  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleged 16 delinquent and/or charged off debts that have been \ndelinquent for a number of years. The debts are Applicant\u2019s debts as established by the \nevidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions. Applicant consolidated his six student loans (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.n) and requested a deferment on his consolidated student loan payment \nbecause he was unemployed for two weeks. His child support debt and arrearages are \nbeing collected through a wage and unemployment benefits garnishment. Other than \nhis student loan consolidation and his payment of child support obligations through a \ncourt imposed garnishment of wages, Applicant presented no evidence he has paid, \nsettled, or properly disputed any of the alleged debts. Applicant does not have the \nfinancial means to pay his legal obligations, delinquent debts, and his day-to-day living \nexpenses. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations, apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant established circumstances beyond his control contributing to his \ninability to pay his debts, i.e., his periods of unemployment and underemployment. I find \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but does not fully mitigate the financial concerns. Applicant\u2019s \nevidence is not sufficient to show he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He \npresented little evidence of debt payments, contacts with creditors, settlement or \nnegotiations of debts, or that he has properly disputed any of his debts. I also find he is \nfinancially overextended and his financial problems are not under control.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (c), (d), and (e) do not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare not yet under control. He also failed to show he made good-faith efforts to resolve \nhis debts. AG \u00b6 20(f) does not apply.  \n \n \nDespite partial applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b), financial considerations concerns are \nnot mitigated. Applicant is financially overextended. He lacks the income to bring his \ndebts to current status. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is attempting to correct his \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfinancial situation by investing in his future through his education. He has successfully \nworked for a defense agency and now as employee of a defense contractor for \napproximately eight months. There is no evidence he has ever compromised classified \ninformation or committed any security violations. Applicant expressed remorse for his \nfinancial mistakes and promised to repay his creditors. He established circumstances \nbeyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts. These factors show \nresponsibility, good judgment, and mitigation. \n \n \nApplicant has been employed since 2001, except for the previously mentioned \nperiods of unemployment in between jobs. His wages and unemployment benefits have \nbeen garnished since 2000 to force him to comply with his child support obligations for \ntwo of his children. His third child lives with his parents. It is not clear whether Applicant \ncontributes financially to his third child\u2019s welfare. His fourth child lives with the child\u2019s \nmother. Applicant provides limited and irregular financial support to this child. On \nbalance, I conclude Applicant presented little evidence of having a track record of \nfinancial responsibility. He presented little documentary evidence of efforts to pay his \nchild support obligations or to resolve his debts. There are no clear indications that his \nfinancial problem is being resolved or is under control. His inability to pay even relatively \nsmall debts shows he is financially overextended. He does not have the financial means \nto resolve his financial problems. Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is insufficient to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h,  \n \n \n \n   and 1.o and 1.p:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i through 1.n: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 18, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\n\n2\nrequested a hearing.  On February 22, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge ignored or mis-weighed\nrecord evidence; whether the Judge failed properly to apply the pertinent mitigating conditions; and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nFinding no error, we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant holds a B.S. in marketing\nand attended law school for one year.  She served as a commissioned officer in the U.S. military\nfrom 1998 to 2003 and was a reservist for two more years thereafter.  She experienced\nunemployment from March 2008 until July 2008, but she now holds a job as a program control and\noperations analyst for a government contractor.  \nApplicant has three delinquent debts, two of which have been reduced to judgments.  She\nalso owes a third debt due to her failure to pay the mortgage on a townhouse.  Although Applicant\nhas entered into a debt repayment program, the Judge concluded that she had failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns in her case.  \u201cApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when she was a mature adult.\nShe is responsible for approximately $70,000 in delinquent debt.  While she recently established\npayment plans to satisfy two judgments, she has failed to demonstrate that she has developed a long-\nterm plan to satisfy her creditors and understands how to avoid excessive debt in the future.\u201d\nDecision at 8. \nApplicant contends that the Judge ignored record evidence and/or that she mis-weighed the\nrecord evidence.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2\n(App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  A Judge is not required to mention or discuss every piece of record\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01616 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-17673\nat 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 2, 2009).  Applicant\u2019s brief on appeal is not sufficient to rebut the presumption\nthat the Judge considered all of the evidence.  Neither is it sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge\nweighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009); ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12,\n2007).  Applicant points to another decision by the Hearing Office, which, she argues, supports her\nrequest for a favorable determination.  The Board gives due consideration to this case.  However,\neach case \u201cmust be decided upon its own merits.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.  Moreover, Hearing Office\ndecisions are binding neither on other Hearing Office Judges nor on the Board.  See ISCR Case No.\n06-24121 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).  \nApplicant states that she was granted a Top Secret clearance in the Navy, despite some\nfinancial problems which she had experienced in college.  As a consequence, she contends that the\nconcerns implicit in her financial difficulties have previously been addressed in her favor and should\nlikewise be mitigated in her current case.  However, prior decisions to grant or retain a clearance do\nnot undermine the legal sufficiency of a Judge\u2019s subsequent adverse decision.  \u201cThe government is\n\nApplicant\u2019s contention that the Judge ignored record evidence arguably is a challenge to the sufficiency of the\n1\nJudge\u2019s findings of fact.

Her eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on July 31, 2008. On September 18, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nFebruary 23, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn October 30, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December \n1, 2009. On December 17, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling \nApplicant\u2019s hearing for January 13, 2010. On that date, I convened a hearing to \nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced 11 exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 11 and admitted to the record without objection. The Government \nalso offered a one-page chart summarizing the status of the six debts alleged on the \nSOR and indicating where information on those debts could be found in the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits. I marked the chart as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1, and it was \nadmitted to the record without objection. \n \n Applicant testified on her own behalf and called four witnesses. She introduced \n38 exhibits, which were marked as Ex. A through Ex. Z and Ex. A-2 through Ex. L-2. \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted to the record without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing on January 22, 2010. \n \n  \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nthe allegations at \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. She denied the allegations at \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.e., and \n1.f.  The Government stipulated that the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.f. had been \nsettled and the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. had been otherwise resolved. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are included herein as findings of fact. (Ex. L; Ex. M; Ex. N; Ex. O; Tr. 39-\n40.) \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old, married, and the mother of two small children. In 1998, \nshe earned a Bachelor of Science degree in marketing. She has attended law school for \none year.  (Ex. 1; Ex. 2; Ex. F-2; Tr.122-124.) \n \n \nApplicant was commissioned as an officer and served on active military duty from \nMay 1998 through June 2003. She was an inactive reservist from July 2003 until May \n2005. She resigned her commission and received an honorable discharge from military \nservice on May 15, 2006. (Ex. 1; Ex. W; Tr. 123.) \n \n \nBetween 2003 and 2005, Applicant worked as a settlement agent and processor \nfor two real estate title companies. In March 2005, Applicant and her mother established \na business which conducted real estate closings for purchase and refinance \ntransactions. In addition to being a co-owner, Applicant served as the operations \nmanager for the business. (Answer to SOR; Ex. 1; Tr. 112-115, 167-169.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn the latter part of 2007, the decline in the real estate market began to affect \nApplicant\u2019s business. In March 2008, Applicant and her mother agreed to close the \nbusiness. In June 2008, the business closed. Applicant was without an income from \nMarch 2008 until she began her present employment in July 2008. She is employed as \na program control and operations analyst by a government contractor. She seeks a \nsecurity clearance. (Ex. 1; Ex. Y; Tr. 129, 170-172.) \n \n \nApplicant is responsible for three delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$70,000. Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports show that she owes a judgment creditor \napproximately $25,872 on a personal loan that she took out in July 2007. The last \npayment on the loan was made in December 2007. In June 2009, the creditor obtained \na judgment against Applicant in order to satisfy the debt. This debt was alleged at SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. (Ex. 5; Ex. 6; Ex. 8; Ex. 11; Tr. 101-102.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted the debt. She advised that in October 2008 she entered an \nagreement with a debt repayment firm and began to make a monthly payment of $554 \nto reduce this and other delinquencies. In September 2009, she removed the debt from \nthe debt repayment program and entered into a repayment agreement with the creditor. \nIn October 2009, she made a payment of $1,500 to the creditor. She also made \npayments of $300 in October, November, and December 2009. (Ex. Z; Ex. A-2; Tr. 63, \n97-101.)    \n \n \nApplicant owes a second judgment creditor approximately $9,969 on a credit \ncard debt that became delinquent in December 2007. This debt, which was alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.b., was also included in Applicant\u2019s debt repayment plan. Applicant hoped to \nsettle the debt, but the debt repayment firm did not negotiate a settlement. Applicant \nrequested that the firm return her money. In December 2009, Applicant made one \npayment of $250 to the judgment creditor. In January 2010, Applicant received a refund \nof approximately $7,348 from the debt repayment firm. Applicant spoke with the creditor \nand discussed the possibility of settling the debt by using some of the refund she \nreceived from the debt repayment firm. (Ex. Z; Ex. B-2; Tr. 105-107.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s third debt arose as a consequence of her failure to pay the mortgage \non a townhouse she purchased in 2004. In 2005, she refinanced the mortgage on the \ntownhouse and purchased a second property as a residence, retaining the townhouse \nas an investment property. The first mortgage on the refinanced townhouse was for \n$332,000. The second mortgage on the refinanced townhouse was for $41,500. (Ex. C-\n2.) \n \n \nApplicant listed the townhouse for sale in August 2005. When the property did \nnot sell by December 2005, she withdrew it from the market. In March 2007, Applicant \nagain listed the townhouse for sale. When the townhouse did not sell by the end of \nSeptember 2007, she again withdrew it from the market. Applicant and a tenant signed \na one-year lease in October 2007. In August 2008, the tenant stopped paying rent.  \nApplicant has pursued payment by suing the tenant in small claims court. Applicant let \nthe property to a second tenant in October 2008. The second tenant stopped paying \n\n \n4 \n \n \nrent in July 2009. The tenant made a partial payment of back rent in October 2009 and \nhas declared bankruptcy. Applicant\u2019s husband has retained the monthly rent payments \nmade by the tenants in his savings account to be used in the event that the lender \napproves a loan modification for the property. Applicant estimated that the rental \npayments saved by her husband in his account total approximately $16,000. (Ex. C-2; \nTr. 110, 118-120.) \n \n \nApplicant has not made payments on the town house mortgage since April 2008, \nand the delinquent debt of $34,000 is still outstanding. Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report \nof January 2010 shows the delinquency has increased to $42,435. The delinquent \nmortgage debt is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c. In September 2008, the lender filed a notice of \nintent to foreclose. The lender has advised Applicant that it will accept nothing less than \nthe full amount of the delinquency, plus attorneys\u2019 fees. Foreclosure has not yet \noccurred. (Ex. 10; Ex. 11; Tr. 83, 107-111, 118, 191.)  \n \n \nApplicant provided information on her past and current expenditures and financial \nstatus. She reported an annual income of $91,520. Her husband is employed as an \nengineering services support manager. His annual salary is $98,820. Additionally, he \nhas a second job which pays approximately $13,000 a year.  (Ex. Y; Tr. 181.) \n \n \nIn December 2005, Applicant purchased a used 2004 Porsche SUV. Her monthly \npayments on the vehicle were $1,009. Applicant made the monthly payments until \nNovember 2009, when she traded the car for 2006 Jeep SUV. Her monthly payments \non the Jeep are $375. (Tr. 112-114.) \n \n \nApplicant settled the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. for less than the amount owed. \nIn a letter to Applicant, dated October 30, 2009, confirming the settlement, the creditor \ngave notice that it was required to file a Form 1099C with the Internal Revenue Service \nfor forgiveness of a debt of $600 or more. Applicant stated that she had not received a \nForm 1099C or a notice of imputed income as the result of settling the debt for less than \nthe amount owed. (Ex. N; Tr. 121-122.)  \n \n \nTogether, Applicant and her husband owe $72,000 in student loans. Applicant \nwas responsible for a monthly scheduled payment of $543 to repay her student loans of \napproximately $45,000. In August 2009, Applicant received notice that she was four \nmonths past due on her student loan debt and owed a delinquency of $2,172, including \nfees and late charges. Applicant paid the student loan creditor approximately $2,302 in \nDecember 2009 to satisfy the delinquency.  (Ex. L-2; Tr. 211-212.) \n \n \nApplicant and her husband received a refund of $18,000 on their 2008 federal \nincome tax filing. They also received a refund on their 2007 federal income tax filing. \nThe refunds were used to pay off debts from Applicant\u2019s business, which was closed in \nJune 2008.  (Tr. 203-205.)   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant provided a household budget that showed the following: net monthly \nhousehold income: $15,1031; monthly debt, including household expenses: $13,789; \nmonthly net remainder: $1,314. Applicant uses the net monthly remainder to satisfy \ndebts not listed on the SOR. (Ex. D-2; Tr. 116-118.) \n \n \nApplicant has several hundred dollars in a savings account. She does not \ncontribute to a retirement account. Her employer has contributed approximately $900 on \nher behalf to a 401k account. (Tr. 115-116.) \n \n \nApplicant provided 15 letters of character reference from friends, co-workers, and \nmanagers with whom she has worked. The letters praised Applicant\u2019s professionalism, \ntechnical skills, and work ethic. A senior officer in the company where Applicant now \nworks stated that he was \u201cvery impressed by her high degree of integrity, responsibility, \nand customer support.\u201d (Ex. U.)   \n \n                                                        Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n1 This figure included $2,000 in rent from the townhouse. Applicant\u2019s Ex. C-2 established that the tenant \noccupying the town house had not paid rent since July 2009 and had declared bankruptcy. When the \ntownhouse rent is subtracted from Applicant\u2019s monthly household income, she appears to have a monthly \ndeficit of over $600. (Ex. C-2; Ex. D-2.) \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns.   \n \nApplicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt. Despite a substantial income, \nshe was unable to pay her creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. If the \nfinancially delinquent behavior \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(a) might \napply. If \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(b) might apply. If \u201cthe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(c) might apply. If \u201cthe individual \ninitiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d then \nAG \u00b6 20(d) might apply. Finally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply. \n \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies began before she \nexperienced financial hardship when her business closed, and they continue to this day. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial delinquencies involve substantial sums of money, occurred \nunder circumstances that are likely to recur, and cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nThe record does not include facts that suggest protracted conditions beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control that would explain her failure over a period of years to meet her \nfinancial obligations. While she experienced unemployment for several months in 2008, \nshe has been steadily employed at a high salary with her current employer since July \n2008. To her credit, Applicant sought to consolidate her debts, and, as of December \n2009, she is current in paying her student loan obligations. She has settled or otherwise \npaid three of the debts alleged on the SOR. However, three other debts, totaling over \n$70,000 and alleged on the SOR, remain unresolved. She and her husband have a \ncombined annual gross income of over $200,000, but it is not clear that she has a plan \nin place for avoid financial overextension in the future. According to her budget, she \nspends more than she earns each month. While Applicant\u2019s intention to satisfy her \ncreditors is laudable, she has failed to demonstrate a track record of financial \nresponsibility. She has not yet demonstrated priorities that emphasize paying her \nexisting debts and avoiding additional financial delinquencies in the future. While I \nconclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply in part to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case, I also \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c) do not apply. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not raised by the facts \nof Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s friends, co-\nworkers, and managers respect and appreciate her professionalism. She works hard \nand is a reliable employee. She has been steadily employed with her current employer \nfor about one and one-half years. She earns a high salary.  \n \nApplicant has addressed her student loan delinquencies only recently, and it is \nnot clear from the information she provided why she did not allocate some of her federal \nincome tax refunds to satisfy her existing debts. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began \nwhen she was a mature adult. She is responsible for approximately $70,000 in \ndelinquent debt. While she recently established payment plans to satisfy two judgments, \nshe has failed to demonstrate that she has developed a long-term plan to satisfy her \ncreditors and understands how to avoid excessive debt in the future. She appears to \nhave a monthly deficit of over $600, putting in doubt her ability to make consistent \npayments to reduce her debt in the future.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I \nconclude, after a careful review of the facts of her case, the Financial Considerations \nadjudicative guideline, and the whole person concept, that Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from her financial delinquencies. If she wishes, and if her \nemployer supports reapplication, Applicant can reapply for a security clearance one \n\n \n9 \n \n \nyear after the date that this decision becomes final. At that time, she can produce new \nevidence that addresses the Government\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n           Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d. through 1.f.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n                                                Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 26, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated response, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 30, 2009. \nFebruary 23, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 9, 2009, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on December 7, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called four \nwitnesses, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were received without \nobjection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to submit additional \ninformation. Applicant submitted two documents, which were marked AE D and E and \nadmitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum is marked Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 15, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is seeking to \nretain his security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since March 2007. \nHe served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from 1971 to 1975. He \nserved in the National Guard from 1981 to 1990. He served in the United States Army \nReserve/National Guard from 1990 until he retired as a sergeant first class in 2006. He \nattended college for a period but did not obtain a degree. He was married from 1972 \nuntil his divorce in 1984. He was married again from 1986 until 2002. He married his \nthird wife in 2003. He has three adult children.1  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances were in order prior to his marital separation in 2001 and \ndivorce in 2002. The court pronounced the judgment of divorce in open court on April \n24, 2002, but the court order was signed on June 28, 2002. The divorce decree ordered \nthat Applicant\u2019s ex-wife receive their home and 53 acres of land, all household \nfurnishings and personal effects in her possession or subject to her sole control, and \n35% of his military retirement pay. The decree ordered that Applicant\u2019s ex-wife pay the \nremainder of the $10,000 promissory note on the real property awarded to her. The \ncourt did not divide the other liabilities by name. Instead, the divorce decree ordered \nthat each party be responsible for all obligations incurred solely by either party after \nApril 18, 2001, as well as all debts outstanding on the property that was awarded to \nthem. The court had Applicant and his ex-wife go to a room in the courthouse and \ndecide which debts each would take as their responsibility. The court then verbally \napproved the division of liabilities. Applicant credibly testified that he paid the debts \nwhich he agreed to pay. He believed he was no longer legally responsible for the debts \nfor which his ex-wife accepted responsibility. Several of the delinquent debts in the SOR \nwere debts which his ex-wife agreed to pay, but did not.2   \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 39-41, 57-61; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 39, 53-54, 61-63; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4; AE E. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, with balances totaling $26,145. \nApplicant denied all the debts alleged in the SOR, with explanations. Individual debts \nare discussed below. \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent debt of $350 to a collection company on \nbehalf of a cellular telephone company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The debt is listed on \ncredit reports obtained in April 2008, May 2009, and December 2009. The 2008 credit \nreport indicates that the account was opened in March 2005. Applicant was serving in \nIraq when the account was opened in 2005. He called the cellular telephone company \nand they told him they did not have any information about the debt. He speculated that \nthe account may have been opened without his authorization by his ex-wife. The 2008 \nand May 2009 credit reports list another $350 debt to a collection company. The 2008 \ncredit report indicates the original creditor was a cellular telephone company. It has a \ndifferent name than the cellular company alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but that is because the \ncompany operated under different names. The debt to this collection company was not \nlisted on the December 2009 credit report. This debt, which was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, is \na duplicate of the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt.3   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a delinquent debt of $3,030 to a collection company on behalf \nof a bank\u2019s credit card. Applicant denied owing this debt, stating it was one of the debts \nthat his ex-wife agreed to pay. The debt is listed on credit reports obtained in April 2008 \nand May 2009. The 2008 credit report indicates that the account was an individual \naccount that was opened in April 1999, with a date of last action as April 2002. The debt \nis not listed on the December 2009 credit report.4 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent debt of $3,057 to an automobile financing \ncompany, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. This was a car loan for his son\u2019s truck. Applicant\u2019s \nex-wife received custody of their son in the divorce. The truck went with the son and the \nex-wife. Applicant indicated that the loan was his ex-wife\u2019s responsibility. The debt is \nlisted on the April 2008 and May 2009 credit reports, but not the December 2009 report. \nThe 2008 credit report indicates that it was a joint account that was opened in August \n2000. The date of last action was October 2002.5  \n \n \nThe delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e (credit card-$2,551) and 1.f (credit \ncard-$6,074) are listed on the April 2008 credit report as joint accounts. Both accounts \nwere listed as opened in 1996, with the date of last activity on the SOR \u00b6 1.e debt as \nMay 2002, and the SOR \u00b6 1.f debt as November 2001. Applicant stated that his ex-wife \nagreed to pay these debts. The 2009 credit reports do not list either debt.6  \n \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 23, 43-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-6. \n \n4 Tr. at 53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-6. \n \n5 Tr. at 55-56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-6; AE E. \n \n6 Tr. at 56-57; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-6. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the delinquent debt of $141 to a collection company on \nbehalf of a telephone company. He paid the debt on December 12, 2009. This debt was \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g.7 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a delinquent debt of $2,595 to a collection company on behalf \nof a bank. The debt is listed on the April 2008 credit report as an individual account that \nwas opened in July 2007, with a date of last action as April 2008. SOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a \ndelinquent debt of $7,997 to a different collection company on behalf of what appears to \nbe the same bank as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. That debt is listed on the April 2008 credit \nreport as a joint account that is in collection status. It was reported in June 2007, and \nthe activity date is June 2007. The 2009 credit reports do not list either debt. Applicant \nstated that these debts were his ex-wife\u2019s responsibility. The 2008 credit report appears \nto indicate that the accounts were opened after the divorce. Collection companies will \nsometimes submit the dates they acquired the accounts to the credit reporting agencies. \nThe credit report would then report dates of occurrences that are later than when the \nactions actually happened. This occurred with the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The 2008 \ncredit report indicates that debt under the original creditor and listed that the account \nwas opened in April 1999, and had a date of last action of April 2002. The May 2009 \ncredit report lists the same debt under the collection company. It lists that account as \nopened in March 2005, and reported in March 2009.8 \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. His credit reports indicate that \nother accounts have been paid. He indicated those were the accounts which were his \nresponsibility. The only delinquent account remaining on the December 2009 credit \nreport is the $350 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, which he disputed. He is not accruing new \ndelinquent debt and is living within his means.9  \n \n \nApplicant served in Vietnam when he was in the Marine Corps. He deployed to \nIraq from the end of 2004 to November 2005. His military awards include the \nMeritorious Service Medal and the Army Commendation Medal (2nd award). Four \nwitnesses testified on his behalf, including his former sergeant major and the lieutenant \ncolonel who served as his battalion executive officer in Iraq. The sergeant major has \nknown Applicant for about 15 years, and the lieutenant colonel has known him about 10 \nyears. Applicant has volunteered to be brought back from retirement to deploy again \nwith his unit. His job performance has been outstanding. He is praised for his patriotism, \nhonor, trustworthiness, judgment, and reliability. The sergeant major stated that he \nwould trust Applicant with his life, and he has done so on multiple occasions.10  \n \n \n \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 50-53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE D. \n \n8 Tr. at 57; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-6. \n \n9 Tr. at 39, 60-64; GE 6.  \n \n10 Tr. at 18-39, 46; AE B, C. \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nThere are nine delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant disputed owing \ntwo debts for $350 and paid a $141 debt. He credibly testified that his ex-wife accepted \nresponsibility for the remaining six debts when they divorced in 2002. He honestly \nbelieved that he did not have to pay those debts. He paid the debts which he agreed to \ntake, and expected her to do the same. None of those six debts are listed on his most \nrecent credit report. I find that the behavior happened under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were incident to his separation and divorce. These \nqualify as conditions that were outside his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) \nalso requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant \nacted responsibly by paying the debts that he took. He could have paid the debts given \nto his wife, but he honestly believed he was no longer legally responsible for those \ndebts. He was mistaken in that belief. He does not receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) \nbecause he was operating under an honest, but mistaken, belief about his legal \nobligations. He has not received financial counseling. Except for the six debts in issue, \nhis finances are in good shape. Those debts are no longer reported on his credit report. \nApplicant receives partial consideration under AG \u00b6 20(c). His actions do not qualify as \na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.11 AG \u00b6 20(d) is \nnot applicable. \n \n \nThe $350 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c are duplicates. Applicant credibly \ntestified that he was not responsible for the underlying cellular telephone debt. The \ncredit reports indicate that the account was opened while Applicant was serving in Iraq. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to those debts. \n \n \n                                                          \n11 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service and his steady employment record. He is a \nveteran of two wars, separated by more than 30 years. His finances were in order prior \nto his divorce in 2002. Applicant and his ex-wife divided their liabilities. He paid the \ndebts which he took. He thought that he was no longer legally responsible for the debts \nwhich his wife accepted. While not specifically listed in the divorce decree, the division \nof liabilities was verbally approved by the court. Applicant is not an overly sophisticated \nman, but he is an honest man. He did not pay the debts because he honestly did not \nthink he had to.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 26, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. DOHA acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, \nas amended (Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 3, 2010. The case was assigned \nto me on June 29, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 12, 2010, and the \nhearing was convened as scheduled on August 3, 2010. The Government offered \nOctober 29, 2010\n\n2 \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were received without objection. An index for the \ngovernment exhibits and a demonstrative exhibit were marked Hearing Exhibits (HE) I \nand II. Applicant testified, called two witnesses, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through \nQ which were received without objection. Applicant\u2019s exhibit list was marked as HE III. I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to submit additional information. \nApplicant submitted AE R-W (note: these exhibits were originally marked as AE L-Q, \nhowever, those letters had previously been assigned to exhibits) which were admitted \nwithout objection. Appellant\u2019s post-hearing correspondence and supplemental exhibit \nlist were marked as HE IV, V, and VI, and Department Counsel\u2019s memo is marked HE \nVII. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 10, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a government contractor. She has worked \nfor her current employer since 2008. She was divorced in 2002 and remarried in 2003. \nShe has three children from her first marriage, ages 19, 16, and 9. She does not receive \nany child support from the children\u2019s father who is currently incarcerated. Her yearly \nsalary is currently $92,000 and her husband\u2019s is $50,000.1 \n \n \nThe SOR lists 36 delinquent debts (including one duplicative debt) totaling about \n$85,651. Applicant admitted that she owed the delinquent debts listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. \n1.n, 1.x, 1.cc, 1.hh, and 1.ii, but denied the rest of the listed debts.2  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial troubles began back in 2002, when she divorced her first \nhusband. Several of the larger balance debts were from joint accounts during their \nmarriage. She did not receive child support from her husband and had to provide for her \nthree children on her own. As of May 2009, she was owed about $32,000 in child \nsupport. During this time she worked low-paying jobs and experienced periods of \nunemployment. Consequently, she was unable to make payments on her debts. She \nattempted to resolve her debts with the assistance of a debt consolidation agency that \nshe hired in April 2009. She stopped making payments under this plan after a few \nmonths because she was dissatisfied with the results.3  \n \n \nIn July 2010, Applicant purchased an internet financial plan from a nationally \nknown financial advisor to assist her in paying off these delinquent debts. Under the \nplan, Applicant is to make monthly payments of $1,280 for almost five years and then \nshe will be debt free. The plan does not cover the $33,442 foreclosure deficiency listed \nat SOR \u00b6 1.n. Applicant has not made any payments under this plan.4 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 28-30, 45; GE 1. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n3 Tr. at 30-32, 69-71; GE 8. \n \n4 AE K; Tr. at 86-87. \n \n\n3 \n \nThe status of the debts is described in the table below and all the debts are listed \nin credit reports dated November 24, 2009, January 20, 2009, and May 1, 2008.5  \n \nDEBT SOR \u00b6 \nAMOUNT STATUS \nEVIDENCE \n1.a  \n$105 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 2 at 1. \n1.b  \n$475 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 2 at 1. \n1.c. \n$207 \n \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 2 at 1. \n1.d \n$50 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 2 at 1. \n1.e \n$626 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 2 at 1. \n1.f \n$237 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 2 at 2. \n1.g \n$25 \nApplicant claims paid off, but no \ndocumentation supporting claim. \nGE 2 at 2. \n1.h \n$87 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 2 at 2. \n1.i \n$7,836 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 2 at 2. \n1.j \n$489 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 2 at 2. \n1.k \n$25 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 2 at 2;  \nGE 4 at 7. \n1.l \n$395 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 2 at 2. \n1.m \n$6,045 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 2 at 3. \n1.n \n$33,442 \nUnresolved \nGE 3 at 1; \nGE 5 \n1.o \n$315 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 3 at 1. \n1.p \n$686 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nPayment of $172 on Aug 17, 2009. \nGE 3 at 1. \nAE R. \n1.q \n$1,435 \nApplicant claims paid off, but no \ndocumentation supporting claim. \nGE 3 at 1. \n1.r \n$458 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 3 at 2. \n1.s \n$444 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 3 at 2. \n1.t \n$41 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 3 at 2. \n                                                          \n5 GE 2-4. \n \n\n4 \nDEBT SOR \u00b6 \nAMOUNT STATUS \nEVIDENCE \n1.u \n$33,442 \nDuplicate debt (1.n) \n \n1.v \n$689 \nDisputes, but admits it was a joint \ndebt with ex-husband \nGE 4 at 4. \n1.w \n$7,342 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 4 at 12; \nGE 8 at 42. \n1.x \n$3,092 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 4 at 13. \n1.y \n$499 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nPayment of $40 on April 6, 2010. \nGE 4 at 13. \nAE T. \n1.z \n$409 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 4 at 14. \n1.aa \n$403 \nIncluded in internet payment plan. \nNo payments made so far. \nGE 4 at 14. \n1.bb \n$200 \nPaid \nAE U. \n1.cc \n$167 \nProposed payment plan or  \nsettlement.

All of the debts are delinquent and \nApplicant has made no other payments.6  \n \n \nApplicant submitted numerous favourable character letters. Additionally she had \ntwo character witnesses testify. She is praised by all for her complete honesty, integrity, \nand trustworthiness. She also received certificates of achievement for taking courses in, \n\u201cSetting financial goals and creating a budget\u201d and \u201cYour banking relationship\u201d.7 \n \n \n \n                                                          \n6 AE Q, S, V.  \n7 AE A-H, J, K, L, M; Tr. at 18-26. \n \n\n5 \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \n\n6 \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:   \n   \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay her obligations for a period. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c).  \n \n  \nSeveral Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20(a) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n\n7 \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAlthough some of Applicant\u2019s debts occurred several years ago, they are still \nowed and they are numerous. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable at this time.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s divorce, failure to receive child support, and periods of unemployment \ncontributed to her financial distress. Those are conditions that were largely beyond her \ncontrol. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant failed to act timely dealing with her \ndebts. Even though she contacted a debt consolidation service in April 2009 and bought \na self-help debt relief program, no substantive debt reduction has happened. AG \u00b6 20 \n(b) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant did take some financial management courses, but there is no indication \nher debts are being resolved or under control. Applicant receives partial consideration \nunder AG 20(c). Her actions do not qualify as a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.8 AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. Her disputed joint \ndebts with her ex-husband are not supported by any documented proof absolving her of \nliability. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n                                                          \n8 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n\n8 \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is 39 \nyears old. She is well thought of in her community and at work. She is considered an \nhonest and trustworthy person. She and her current husband make a combined annual \nincome of over $140,000. Applicant struggled during and after her divorce from her first \nhusband, particularly since he failed to pay child support. Despite those circumstances, \nApplicant has had sufficient time to develop a plan of action to deal with her debts, yet \nshe failed to do so. Applicant\u2019s financial track record does not persuade me that she will \nsatisfy the delinquent debts.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.t: \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.v-1.aa:  \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.bb:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.cc-1.ii: \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n9 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nRobert E.

Cervi, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance to work in the defense industry. The record shows Applicant has a\nhistory of financial problems or difficulties as evidenced by delinquent accounts, a\nbroken apartment lease, and a mortgage loan that went into foreclosure. Although his\ncurrent financial situation is much improved, the record contains insufficient evidence to\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns stemming from his problematic\ncredit history. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nJanuary 14, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines), which were made effective within the Defense Department on September\n1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n Exhibit 1. \n2\n Tr. 8. \n3\n Exhibit 1. \n4\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on April 20, 2009. The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the\nfactual basis for the action under Guideline F for financial considerations. Also, the SOR\nrecommended submitting the case to an administrative judge for a determination\nwhether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion, and he requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 13, 2009. The hearing took place September\n23, 2009. The transcript (Tr.) was received October 1, 2009.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old field service representative who is employed by a\nfederal contractor. He began his current employment in June 2008, and he completed a\nsecurity clearance application the same month.  This is his initial application for a\n2\nsecurity clearance to work in the defense industry.  \n3\n   \nMarried in 1984, Applicant and his wife have two children and a stepchild. The\nthree children are adults, none of whom reside with Applicant.   \nHis employment history shows he has been continuously employed, except for a\nfew weeks in 2005, since at least June 2000.  He is a journeyman electrician. He is\n4\ncurrently enrolled in a correspondence program studying to obtain an associate\u2019s\ndegree in electrical engineering. \nApplicant traces his financial problems back to the 2005 period, when he and his\nwife moved to another state so she could accept a job offer to manage a restaurant.\nApplicant quit his job as an electrician to move with his wife, and he was unemployed\nfor about six weeks until he found employment as a project electrician. His wife\u2019s job\nended after about three months when she left by mutual agreement with the owner, who\nproved difficult to work for. When they moved, they were unable to sell their home and\n\n Exhibit 2. \n5\n Tr. 80\u201381. \n6\n Exhibits 2, 3, 4, and 5. \n7\n Exhibit 2. \n8\n Exhibit A. \n9\n3\nrented it only briefly because the tenant did not pay as agreed. They fell behind on their\nmortgage loan, and in time decided to allow the property to go into foreclosure. The\nproperty was sold in March 2006.  After the sale, neither Applicant nor his wife received\n5\nnotice that they owed a deficiency balance.  Multiple credit reports show a zero balance\n6\non the account.  The law firm that handled the foreclosure has done nothing with the\n7\nmatter since the sale.  And Applicant provided documentary proof that there are no\n8\nliens, judgments, or suits pending against him in the county where the foreclosed\nproperty is located.9\nIn about January 2006, Applicant found a better job in another state. Taking the\njob resulted in breaking an apartment lease. Applicant then worked as an electrical lead\nuntil 2008, when Applicant began his current employment in another state. His employer\nprovided a relocation package that covered the moving expenses. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is not currently employed outside the home. She and Applicant\nlive in a rental property near Applicant\u2019s place of work, but they also have a rental\nproperty in the another state. This arrangement allows Applicant\u2019s wife to spend time in\nboth locations and stay in touch with family members.  \nThe SOR alleged five delinquent debts ranging in amounts from $296 to $56,000,\nfor a total of approximately $63,500. The current status of the debts is summarized in\nthe following table.\nDebts\nStatus\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013$296 charged-off credit card\naccount.\nUnresolved; account was closed or\ntransferred and $1,041 was written off\n(Exhibit 2). Credit reports show a zero\nbalance owed to the original creditor\n(Exhibits 3, 4, and 5).   \nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013$56,000 delinquent mortgage\nloan.\nForeclosure completed and property sold\nin Mar. 2006; details discussed above. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013$4,954 collection account\nstemming from the broken lease in 2006. \nSettled for $3,700 in Jun. 2009 (Exhibit\nB).  \n\n Exhibit C. \n10\n Tr. 70, 83\u201384. \n11\n Tr. 82. \n12\n Department of Navy v.

Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n14\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n15\n4\nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013$1,504 charged-off credit\ncard account.\nSettled in Aug. 2008 (Exhibits D and F).  \nSOR \u00b6 1.e\u2013$780 collection account.\nAccount closed with a zero balance\n(Exhibit E). \nIn addition to the five debts in the SOR, Applicant provided documentary proof that he\npaid in full a charged-off account in February 2009.  \n10\nApplicant attributes his financial problems to poor judgment when he and his wife\noverextended themselves financially.  He describes his current financial situation as\n11\n\u201cthe best it\u2019s been\u201d and believes they \u201care in good shape.\u201d  They have no current credit\n12\ncard accounts and use a debit card to manage their money. They have about $1,500 in\ncash accounts. His gross income for 2008 was about $103,000, and he estimates his\ngross income for 2009 at about $71,000. They are currently working with a mortgage\nbanker to improve their credit score in hopes of purchasing the home they are renting in\ntheir home state. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n13\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n14\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n15\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n16\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n17\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n21\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n22\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n23\n5\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n16\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n17\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n18\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n19\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n20\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.21\nThe Agency\u2019s appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.22\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n23\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n24\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n25\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n26\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n27\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n28\n6\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n24\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n25\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\ndifficulties. This history raises concerns because it indicates inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of\n26\n27\nGuideline F. The facts are more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying\nconditions, and they suggest financial irresponsibility as well.\nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security\nconcerns.  Of the six conditions, the record shows that three apply in Applicant\u2019s favor\n28\nas follows: \n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and \n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n29\n7\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nThis is a close case, but the credit in mitigation is insufficient to overcome the\nsecurity concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s problematic credit history. His history includes\nmore than the typical collection and charged-off credit accounts. In 2005, Applicant and\nhis wife made the conscious decision to allow the property to go into foreclosure\nproceedings. He does not know with absolute certainty, but it appears that a deficiency\nbalance is not owed. Following the foreclosure, Applicant made a conscious decision in\n2006, when he broke an apartment lease to start a new job in another state. While that\nmay be the cost of accepting a new job, it was the height of financial irresponsibility to\ndo nothing with the debt until about June 2009 (two months after the SOR was issued to\nhim), when the debt was settled for a lesser amount. The other delinquent consumer\ndebts complete the picture. Looking forward, based on his problematic credit history and\nhis uneven efforts to address it, the likelihood of additional financial problems cannot be\nruled out at this time. \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s history of\nfinancial difficulties create current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. He did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe security concerns. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the nine-\nfactor whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence. Applicant did not\n29\nmeet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This\ncase is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.e: \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On \nOctober 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. DOHA acted under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on November 9, 2009; answered it on November 23, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nApril 19, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrequest on November 25, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nDecember 31, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on January 4, 2010. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on January 19, 2010, scheduling the hearing for February 19, \n2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of three \nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through Z, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 1, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations of failing to timely \nfile state and federal tax returns alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, and she offered \nexplanations. She denied the allegation of an unpaid tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Her \nadmissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old software engineer employed by a defense contractor \nsince July 1997. She has held a security clearance since October 1997. Her most \nrecent performance appraisal rates her as a \u201c3\u201d on a five-point scale, signifying that she \n\u201cmeets expectations.\u201d Her supervisor commented, \u201cI have total confidence in [Applicant] \nand her abilities.\u201d (AX J.) \n \n \nApplicant married in November 1978 and divorced in May 1982. She married her \ncurrent spouse in April 1985. She and her current spouse have three children, ages 22, \n17, and 14. She obtained an associate\u2019s degree in business management from a \ncommunity college in May 2002. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has owned and operated an electrical contracting company \nsince 1986. The company is organized as a Subchapter S corporation, in which the \ncompany profits flow directly to him and are taxed as personal income. Applicant assists \nwith the company payroll, bookkeeping, and work scheduling. (Tr. 125.) They do not \nuse a computer to manage their business. Instead, they do everything \u201clong-hand.\u201d (Tr. \n79-81.) Applicant and her spouse file joint federal and state income tax returns. To \ndetermine their personal income, they need to file the company return first. (Tr. 34-35.) \n \n \nIn October 2003, Applicant\u2019s mother was diagnosed with a brain tumor and lung \ncancer. She underwent brain surgery followed by chemotherapy. Applicant\u2019s father \nsuffered from severe back problems, had difficulty walking, and was unable to care for \nhis wife. Applicant visited her mother twice daily and was primarily responsible for her \ncare until she passed away in September 2004. (AX L; Tr. 120.)  \n \nThree months after Applicant\u2019s mother passed away, her father underwent the \nback surgery he had postponed. Unfortunately, complications during the surgery left him \nunconscious for six days, followed by paralysis from the neck down. After about a \nmonth of physical therapy, he regained the use of his legs, but his arms remained \nparalyzed. He is diabetic and required insulin injections four times a day. During the \nday, a certified nursing assistant cared for Applicant\u2019s father, but she went to his house \n\n \n3 \n \n \nevery morning and evening to care for him. He was disabled for about a year. (Answer \nto SOR; Tr. 121-24; GX 2 at 5.) He continued to receive physical therapy until 2008. (Tr. \n44.) \n \nDuring this same period, Applicant\u2019s spouse suffered a ruptured disc in his back \nand underwent surgery. He recovered from the back surgery, but now suffers from a \nkidney disease that will require removing both kidneys. Applicant has volunteered to \nprovide a replacement kidney for him. (Answer to SOR; AX I; Tr. 72, 125.) \n \nApplicant continued to work full-time, help run the family business, and care for \nher children at the same time she was caring for her parents. The combination of all the \nmedical problems suffered by Applicant\u2019s family and her spouse overwhelmed her, and \nshe failed to timely file their corporate and personal tax returns. In 2005, they began \nworking with their certified public accountant (CPA) to file the overdue tax returns. Filing \nthe overdue returns was delayed by the difficulty of tracking down old records of \nbusiness expenses. (GX 2 at 3, 5.) Even though their CPA was a long-time friend, \nApplicant and her spouse became frustrated with his lack of progress on the overdue \nreturns, and they hired another CPA in late 2007 (Tr. 77-78.)  \n \nIn October 2008, Applicant and her spouse filed their corporate and personal \nincome tax returns for tax year 2004. (AX A; AX B; Tr. 46-48.) In July 2009, they filed \ntheir corporate and personal tax returns for tax years 2005 through 2007. (AX N through \nS.) In September 2009, they filed their returns for tax year 2008. (AX T.) They received \na refund for tax year 2008, which was applied to the taxes they owed for previous years. \n(Tr. 140.) As of the date of the hearing, their new CPA was preparing their returns for \n2009. (Tr. 59.) \n \nAlthough they were late in filing the corporate and personal tax returns, they \nremained current on withholding federal and state income taxes, Social Security taxes, \nand Medicare taxes from their employees. They had about five employees for most of \nthe period from 2003-2007 (Tr. 142-43.) The company now consists of Applicant\u2019s \nspouse and their oldest son. Applicant testified that she realized in hindsight that they \nshould have hired someone to assist her with the business during the time she was \ncaring for her mother and father. (Tr. 163.) \n \nIn October 2009, Applicant and her spouse retained a tax attorney, and he \nnegotiated a settlement of their unpaid 2004 federal taxes for $37,389, which they paid \nin full on April 15, 2009, using funds from Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s retirement annuity. (AX \nC; AX D; AX M; Tr. 50, 61.) They took advantage of a tax amnesty program and settled \nthe 2004 state taxes for $11,709. (AX D.)  \n \nIn February 2010, Applicant and her spouse submitted offers in compromise for \nthe state and federal taxes due for 2005 through 2008. (AX E; AX F; AX G.) They \nborrowed money from Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law to tender the required 20% of the \nestimated taxes due for their federal and state taxes. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has \nagreed to loan them a total of about $50,000, and they have agreed to repay her at the \n\n \n4 \n \n \nrate of $500 per month (AX H.) As of the date of the hearing, they had not received \nresponses to their offers in compromise. \n \nA coworker and close friend for more than 35 years testified that Applicant is \ntrustworthy and honest. (Tr. 84-87.) Several life-long friends provided letters attesting to \nher integrity, compassion, dedication, and moral values. (AX Z at 1-3, 5, 7.) Present and \nformer coworkers were impressed by her dedication, trustworthiness, and meticulous \nperformance of duty. (AX Z at 4, 6.) The facility security officer (FSO) at Applicant\u2019s \nwork site testified Applicant informed him of her tax problems when he became FSO \nabout two years ago, and she provided him with regular updates on her tax situation. He \nconsiders her honest and trustworthy. (AX K; Tr. 97-98.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant failed to file her state and federal income tax returns \nfor 2005, 2006, and 2007 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f), and that she owes the Internal Revenue \nService about $37,389 for tax year 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.g).  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nThree potentially disqualifying conditions are relevant: AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised by an \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(g) is raised by \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same.\u201d  \n \nThe evidence shows that Applicant eventually paid her federal income taxes for \n2004, but that her tax liability for tax years 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 is not yet fully \nresolved. Although she failed to timely file her returns, there is no evidence of any \nfraudulent returns. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (g) are raised, shifting the \nburden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 \n\n \n6 \n \n \nE3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s tax \ndelinquencies were recent and numerous, but the circumstances that caused her to \nneglect her responsibilities were unusual and not likely to recur. Her failure to get help \nrunning the business and her failure to file her tax returns are a serious cause of \nconcern. However, after overcoming multiple and simultaneous family crises, she and \nher spouse have embarked on a realistic and responsible solution. Her past derelictions \ndo not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. The multiple medical disasters \nthat befell Applicant were beyond her control. In most cases, there is not a direct cause-\nand-effect relationship between family illness and failure to file tax returns, but in this \ncase the family illnesses and Applicant\u2019s multiple family responsibilities were \noverwhelming, causing her to neglect other obligations. Once her family situation \nstabilized, she was dilatory in resolving her tax delinquencies, in part because of her \nreluctance to break her relationship with their CPA, a family friend. In October 2008, \nhowever, she and her spouse started taking decisive and responsible measures to \nrectify the situation. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is established, because Applicant and her spouse hired a new CPA, \nhired a tax lawyer, followed their advice, and are on the way toward resolving their tax \nproblems.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). An applicant need not establish that every \ndelinquent debt has been paid in full. An applicant must, however, establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant and her spouse have a \n\n \n7 \n \n \nrealistic plan to resolve their tax delinquencies and have taken significant steps to \nimplement it. They have filled all their returns. They cashed in a substantial retirement \nannuity to pay delinquent taxes. They paid their 2004 taxes, submitted offers in \ncompromise, arranged to borrow the funds they estimate will be necessary to resolve \ntheir tax problems, and paid 20% of their estimated taxes for 2005 through 2008. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature woman who has worked as a federal contractor and held a \nclearance since 1997. She is highly respected in her community and among her \ncoworkers. She was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. She is deeply devoted \nto her family and has a reputation for dedication and attention to duty at work. Her \nhusband\u2019s business is a family operation, dependent on Applicant to handle the \nbookkeeping and administration. Applicant realizes in hindsight that she and her \nhusband should have hired someone to help her with the bookkeeping and taxes when \nshe was overwhelmed by a confluence of family emergencies. Applicant and her \nhusband asked their CPA, a long-time family friend, to take care of the overdue tax \nreturns in 2005. When the CPA was dilatory, they were reluctant to terminate their \nrelationship with a long-time friend. They finally hired a new CPA and a tax attorney, \nand their tax problems are now under control.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my \nobligation to resolve close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR, as required by \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to 1 support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant, who is 72 years old, works as a security patrolmen for a Department of Defense contractor. Applicant has worked for this contractor since he began his employment 12 years ago, and has held a security clearance without incident. He served in the United States Army from 1954 to 1957. After his discharge from the Army, he enrolled in college. Although he attended college for four years, he did not graduate.2 Applicant married in 1967. He and his wife had one son, who died in 2004. His wife died in 2007. Applicant lives alone. During his marriage, he and his wife experienced financial problems, which became severe in the 1980s and 1990s because of loss of income at his job. He did not file bankruptcy, choosing to pay his debts in full.3 Applicant currently owns six properties in two states. Two properties are tenant occupied, and he resides in one property. He does not have a mortgage on any of the six properties. He pays his taxes on the properties each year. At the time of the hearing, he had paid his current tax assessment on these properties. His current tax bills show he does not have any past tax arrearage.4 GE 2; AE G; AE H; AE J; AE L; AE M; AE R. 5 GE 2; AE C; AE D; AE E; AE F; Tr. 57. 6 GE 2; Tr. 53-54; Response to SOR.",

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F on June 22,\n2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 2, 2009. He answered the\nSOR in writing on July 20, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative\nJanuary 12, 2010\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd.

DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 25, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on October 19, 2009. The government offered seven exhibits\n(GE) 1 through 7, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted 21 exhibits (AE) A through U, which\nwere received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 27, 2009.

The record closed on November 2, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.f of the SOR, with explanations.  He also provided additional information to\n1\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 72 years old, works as a security patrolmen for a Department of\nDefense contractor. Applicant has worked for this contractor since he began his\nemployment 12 years ago, and has held a security clearance without incident. He\nserved in the United States Army from 1954 to 1957. After his discharge from the Army,\nhe enrolled in college. Although he attended college for four years, he did not graduate.2\n      \nApplicant married in 1967. He and his wife had one son, who died in 2004. His\nwife died in 2007. Applicant lives alone. During his marriage, he and his wife\nexperienced financial problems, which became severe in the 1980s and 1990s because\nof loss of income at his job. He did not file bankruptcy, choosing to pay his debts in full.3\nApplicant currently owns six properties in two states. Two properties are tenant\noccupied, and he resides in one property. He does not have a mortgage on any of the\nsix properties. He pays his taxes on the properties each year. At the time of the hearing,\nhe had paid his current tax assessment on these properties. His current tax bills show\nhe does not have any past tax arrearage.4\n\nGE 2; AE G; AE H; AE J; AE L; AE M; AE R.\n5\nGE 2; AE C; AE D; AE E; AE F; Tr. 57. \n6\nGE 2; Tr. 53-54; Response to SOR.\n7\nGE 2; AE A; AE V; Tr. 18-19, 41, 52.\n8\nGE 2; AE S; AE T; AE U; Tr. 46-47, 49-50.

See GE 2; GE 3.  \n3\nApplicant earns $4,400 a month in gross income from his current position. In\naddition to his salary, Applicant receives monthly income from social security and three\npensions, totaling approximately $7,000 a month. He also receives $993 in income on\none rental property. The rental income covers the monthly operating expenses for the\nproperty. Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses average $1,325. His yearly property taxes total\n$7,625. Applicant has sufficient monthly income to pay his monthly living expenses and\nyearly property taxes.  \n5\nApplicant also has several investment accounts, including a 401k account. His\ninvestment accounts total approximately $146,000. He has a life insurance policy with a\ncash value of $17,000. In 2008, he contributed more than $11,000 to his church. He\ncontributes to other charities. Applicant estimates his net worth at more than\n$1,000,000.  \n6\nApplicant first learned about negative information on his credit report when he\nmet with the security investigator in 2008. After this meeting, he spent a significant\namount of time attempting to talk with the creditors listed in his credit reports.\nEventually, Applicant determined that the four unpaid debts listed on his credit reports\ndid not belong to him. He filed a complaint with the police in June 2009, alleging identity\ntheft. The police have not provided him with any information on the status of his\ncomplaint. He also filed a fraud alert with the credit reporting companies.7\nApplicant acknowledged the tax liens identified in SOR allegations 1.e ($4,343)\nand 1.f ($903), but denied he owed these debts. Applicant paid the July 1995 tax lien in\n2005. He later learned that he still owed $37 on the debt, which he paid in March 2009.\nHe has resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e in full. Applicant paid the March 1993 tax lien in\nSOR \u00b6 1.f in full in September 2000.8\nApplicant denied that he owed the four debts listed in SOR allegations 1.a\nthrough 1.d. He challenged these debts with two credit reporting companies on June 2,\n2009. He also wrote to the creditor listed in SOR allegation 1.b on June 22, 2009,\nchallenging the validity of this debt. The credit reporting companies removed three\ndebts from his credit report by August 2009 and the last debt by October 2009.\nApplicant established that he does not owe the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.a to 1.d.9\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. The\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The credit reports submitted by the government establish that\nApplicant accumulated some delinquent debt, which had not been paid. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s two tax liens occurred\nfor tax issues which arose in the 1980s and 1990s. He paid one lien in 2000 and the\nsecond lien in 2005, except for $37. The second lien totaled over $6,000, 99% of which\nhe paid in 2005.  Because of an oversight by the state, the remaining $37 was not paid\nuntil recently. The remaining debts in the SOR are not his, but the result of identity theft\nor fraud, which he has reported to the police and the credit reporting agencies. I find the\nbehavior occurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it\ndoes not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nThis mitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ While Applicant has not received financial counseling, he has\nresolved all the delinquent debts in the SOR, either by payment or dispute. He is\nfinancially sound and prepared for future contingencies. He showed good faith towards\nhis creditors. I conclude that mitigating condition AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) apply.\nFinally, evidence that \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\n\nAG \u00b6 20(f) is not raised in this case.\n10\n6\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue\u201d is potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant\ndisputed, in writing, the four debts listed in SOR allegations 1.a through 1.d with the\ncredit reporting agencies and with the creditor listed in SOR allegation 1.c. He also filed\nan identity theft complaint with the police and a fraud alert with one credit reporting\ncompany. His actions resulted in the removal of all four debts from his credit reports.\nThis mitigating condition applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.d.10\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to Applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is\n72 years old and has been employed as a security officer for the last 12 years.\nApplicant developed financial problems in the 1980s and 1990s because he steadily lost\nincome from his job. He chose to pay his debts over filing for bankruptcy. He resolved\nhis old debts over time, including two tax liens related to his financial problems from this\ntime period. Since paying these debts, Applicant has lived within his income on a\n\n7\nmonthly basis. He has sufficient income each month to pay his monthly living expenses\nand to donate money to his church. \nApplicant challenged the four unpaid debts listed on his credit reports as\nfraudulent. As a result of his challenge, these debts have been removed from his credit\nreport. Applicant owns several properties and has sufficient income each month to pay\nall his expenses. He is financially secure. Given his assets of approximately one million\ndollars and his monthly income of approximately $11,000, there is little likelihood that he\ncan be pressured, coerced, exploited, or forced to reveal classified information based\non his financial situation.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances under\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 15 articulates the security concerns relating to \npersonal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition under AG \u00b6 16 is potentially \napplicable: \n \n (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \n \n5 \n\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities . . .  \n \nIn April 2009, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he failed to indicate he had \nleft a job by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct. In \nSeptember 2006, Applicant misused his government credit card by purchasing an airline \nticket for personal use. He was counseled about his misconduct and lost the use of his \ngovernment credit card for three months. Shortly after the card was returned, he again \nmisused the card by purchasing items for personal use. He was given the option to \nresign or to be fired. Applicant admits his answer on the e-QIP was dishonest. To \nApplicant\u2019s credit, in response to a financial question on the same e-QIP, he indicated \nhe made unauthorized purchases with his government credit card.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could potentially mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \n \n6 \n\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors apply. There was no prompt good-faith effort to \ncorrect the falsification. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. Applicant was told that if he \nresigned he would not have to list the firing. He was never told he would not have to \nindicate he had been terminated by mutual agreement following misconduct. AG \u00b6 17(b) \ndoes not apply. The offense was not minor and occurred only one year ago. AG \u00b6 17(c) \ndoes not apply even though the falsification was limited to a single section of the e-QIP. \nThere is no indication Applicant has obtained counseling to change the behavior or \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused the untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or inappropriate behavior. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. There is no evidence \nof positive steps taken to reduce or eliminate vulnerability. AG \u00b6 17(e) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply because the falsification was substantiated. Applicant admits \nhis e-QIP answer was dishonest. AG \u00b6 17(g) does not apply because association with \npersons involved in criminal activity was not an issue.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his adverse employment history demonstrates a \nlack of candor required of public trust personnel. The Government has an interest in \nexamining all relevant and material adverse information about an applicant before \nmaking a security clearance decision. The Government relies on applicants to truthfully \ndisclose that adverse information in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived to be \nprudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information \nabout himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security \nviolations or other concerns in the future, something the Government relies on to \nperform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate \ngovernment interests.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \n7 \n\nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. Applicant had four accounts placed \nfor collection and three other delinquent accounts, which total approximately $19,000. \nThree of Applicant\u2019s debts were under $200 each and remain unpaid. Disqualifying \nConditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has failed to document payment of any of the delinquent obligations. \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors. His financial difficulties are both recent \nand multiple, and they occurred under circumstances that are likely to recur. (AG \u00b6 \n20(a)) He failed to demonstrate that his debts were largely due to circumstances \nbeyond his control, or that he has acted responsibly in addressing his debts. (AG & \n20(b)) Further, he has not sought credit counseling, or otherwise brought the problem \nunder control as his circumstances permitted. (AG & 20(c)) AG & 20(d) does not apply \n \n8 \n\nbecause there is no good-faith effort to repay the creditors or otherwise resolve the \ndebts.  \n \n \nFor AG & 20(e) to apply there must be a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt and documented proof to substantiate the basis of the \ndispute. Applicant asserted that he paid the three debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, and \n1.h, but he provided no documentation showing the debts have been paid. His failure to \nsubmit documentation supporting his claim of payment, such as court records, receipts, \ncopies of canceled checks, or letters from creditors verifying the status of delinquent \naccounts, makes AG & 20(e) inapplicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts remain unpaid. It is noted \nthat two of the debts are approximately $50 and one is $150. Applicant was asked \nabout his financial problems in September 2006. He was specifically asked about the \n$150 utility bill and also other debts. In the three years since that interview, he has failed \nto pay the debts or to provide documentation showing payment. Approximately one year \nago, Applicant was again questioned about his delinquent obligations in two written \ninterrogatories. The obligations were not paid, nor was documentation provided showing \nthey have been addressed. As to the personal conduct, Applicant admitted his answer \non the e-QIP was dishonest. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct.  \n \n9 \n\n \n10 \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Personal Conduct:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u20141.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Financial Considerations:  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u20142.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant is a 22-year-old student at an art institute, working part time\nfor a Defense contractor.  She is succeeding academically, ranking in the top 10 % of her class.  \nIn 2007 Applicant first tried marijuana.  She subsequently used marijuana as often as three\nor four times a week, though her use eventually declined in frequency.  She no longer associates with\nindividuals who use drugs.  Her last two uses of marijuana occurred after she had submitted her\nsecurity clearance application.  In addition to marijuana, Applicant has used ecstasy once,\nOxycodone once and Clonazepam three times (each of these uses was without a prescription), and\ncocaine three times.  During a security clearance interview, Applicant stated that she might use\nmarijuana socially if it were present.  In response to subsequent interrogatories, Applicant stated that\nshe had no intention to use marijuana in the future.  \nAlthough Applicant contends that the Judge did not give proper weight to her evidence in\nmitigation, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.

(Tr. 40) \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n2 \n\n \nIn 2005, following high school, Applicant went to a large state university in \nanother state, which was a big change for her. Applicant discovered the large university \nwas not for her. At the end of 2005, following one semester, Applicant returned home \nand fell in with the wrong crowd. The people she met and associated with were those \nnot attending school. In April 2007, Applicant first tried marijuana. (Tr. 50) She was \nworking in a movie theater when she attended a party at the home of two co-workers.  \n \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant was living at home when she met others who had a \nnegative influence on her. (Tr. 44, 51) They were visiting the area for the summer and \nleft in August 2007. (Tr. 51) She used marijuana with these individuals three or four \ntimes a week. (Tr. 51, Ex. 3) Applicant no longer sees or associates with these \nindividuals since they have moved to the other coast. Applicant was working at a \nrestaurant. After that group left, Applicant still associated with people who used drugs \nfrom the movie theater and restaurant. (Tr. 52) Her marijuana use declined to once \nevery couple of months. (Tr. 51) Applicant no longer associates with these individuals \nbut now associates with fellow students. Applicant stated she was a much healthier and \nhappier person now that the negative influence is out of her life and she has met new \nfriends. (Rex. 2)  \n \n \nOn October 7, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in which she disclosed her illegal drug history. At a \nHalloween party in 2008, Applicant used marijuana. (Tr. 53) Shortly thereafter, she was \ninterviewed about her drug usage, at which time she revealed all her use including her \nOctober usage. (Tr. 54) Her last use of marijuana occurred in January 2009 with a high \nschool acquaintance. (Tr. 62) Both of these uses occurred after she had applied for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant was honest, forthcoming, and cooperative in discussing \nher illegal drug usage.  \n \n \nBetween December 2007 and February 2008, Applicant used Clonazepam three \ntimes. (Tr. 46) Applicant first used it out of curiosity. In December 2007, during a panic \nattack, Applicant took one tablet of Clonazepam, which she obtained from a friend who \nhad a prescription for the drug. The drug calmed her down. During the third incident, \nApplicant was shaking and crying uncontrollably when her mother gave her one tablet of \nClonazepam. Her mother had a prescription for the drug. When Applicant took the drug \nshe stopped crying, felt better, relaxed, and returned to normal. (Ex. 3)  \n \nDuring the summer of 2007, Applicant tried ecstasy and oxycodone one time \neach, the result of peer pressure. (Tr. 55) She obtained the oxycodone from a friend \nwho had her wisdom teeth removed. (Tr. 60) Between July 2007 and July 2008, \nApplicant used cocaine three times. Each use occurred at a friend\u2019s home. (Ex. 3) \nApplicant believes cocaine to be \u201cunbelievably dangerous and addictive.\u201d (Ex. 2)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father died the week she started her current job. When her father \ndied, she realized how short and precious life is and decided not to waste it on \ndangerous and harmful pursuits. (Ex. 2) She made a commitment to a healthy lifestyle \nand joined a gym. She has sought therapy to help her with the grief of losing her father.  \n \n3 \n\n \nIn a November 2008 interview, Applicant stated she might continue occasional \nsocial use of marijuana if marijuana was present. She stated she had no intention to \nseek out marijuana, purchase marijuana, or use any other illegal drugs in the future. \n(Ex. 3) In February 2009, Applicant stated she had no interest, under any \ncircumstances, to use marijuana or other illegal drugs in the future. (Ex. 4) Following the \nhearing, Applicant submitted a pledge never to use illegal drugs in the future. (Ex. J) \nApplicant understands the government\u2019s zero tolerance policy towards illegal drugs. (Tr. \n63) Applicant no longer associates with any of the individuals with whom she had used \nillegal drugs. (Tr. 63)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandfather is the assistant facility security officer for the company \nwhere Applicant works. (Tr. 68) Applicant\u2019s grandmother has recently died and \nApplicant is helping her grandfather with the arrangements and throughout this period. \n(Tr. 69) Applicant states her illegal drug use were choices made by a young, immature, \nand foolish teenager. She sees her past usage as shameful and humiliating. (Tr. 21) \nApplicant has yet to graduate from college. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n \n4 \n\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n \nRevised adjudicative guideline (AG) \u00b6 24 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) any drug abuse; \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n5 \n\n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and, \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \nStarting in April 2007, Applicant used marijuana for the first time. During the \nsummer of 2007, she used it three or four times a week. She also experimented with \nother drugs using cocaine three times, Clonazepam three times, ecstasy, and \noxycodone once. In August 2007, when Applicant\u2019s associates returned home to the \nother coast, her use of marijuana greatly declined, but did not end. She used it at a \nHalloween party in 2008 after she had completed her e-QIP and last used it in January \n2009. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies.  \nAG \u00b6 25(g) does not apply because Applicant had applied for a clearance, but \ndid not have a clearance during her last two uses. However, it does go to the question \nof judgment for someone to use marijuana after applying for clearance and after having \nbeen interviewed about her drug use. This conduct is discussed under personal conduct \nbelow.  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand, \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \n \n6 \n\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n  \nAG \u00b6 26(b) (1), (2), and (4) have some applicability. Applicant no longer \nassociates with those who use illegal drugs. Her associates have returned to the other \ncoast. She no longer associates with those individuals she knew from the movie theater \nand restaurant. She is an honor student associating with other students. She has signed \na statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.  \nAG \u00b6 26(a) only partially applies because her illegal drug use of certain drugs \nappears to be infrequent. Her use of cocaine, Clonazepam, oxycodone, and ecstasy \nappear to be experimental and infrequent. Additionally, they were last used more than \ntwo years ago. However, her use of marijuana was more frequent and more recent. Her \nmarijuana use did not occur under unusual circumstances and her use does cast doubt \non her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nThe major concern is that Applicant\u2019s last used marijuana eight months ago. \nThere are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The \ndetermination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within \nthe parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. \nAug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 \nmonths before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge \nmust determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or \nconduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d2 I do not fine eight \nmonths to be a significant period of time.  \n                                                          \n2 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \n \n7 \n\n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \n \nRevised adjudicative guideline (AG) \u00b6 25 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to personal conduct: \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe last two times Applicant\u2019s used marijuana occurred after she had started her \nsecurity clearance process. It shows questionable judgment for someone to use \nmarijuana after applying for clearance and after having been interviewed about her drug \nuse. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing]. It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n \n8 \n\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors apply. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply because the \nconduct of concern was marijuana usage after having applied for a clearance. There \nwere no allegations of falsification or omission. The record is clear that Applicant was \nalways honest and forthcoming as it related to her illegal drug usage. AG \u00b6 17(b) does \nnot apply because there was no failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment. \n \n \nThe use of illegal drugs was not minor, her last use was recent, and her use does \ncast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not \napply. AG \u00b6 17(d) only partially applies because Applicant has acknowledged the \nbehavior and no longer associates with those who use illegal drugs. However, it is too \nsoon to find the behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(e) only partially applies because, \nalthough Applicant has taken steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by no longer associating with drug users, the question is her \nuse, and not the possibility of vulnerability, that was the security concern.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply because her illegal drug use was substantiated. AG \u00b6 \n17(g) partially applies because Applicant no longer associates with persons involved in \ncriminal activities. However, it was her illegal drug usage and not merely her association \nwith drug users that was of security concern.  \n \nWhole Person \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n9 \n\n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a college senior, an \nhonor student, and president of an honor society. Her work supervisor states she is \ndedicated, intelligent, trustworthy, and does outstanding work all while being on the \ndean\u2019s list at school. Her instructors and faculty members state she is a bright and \ndistinguished student who shows great leadership skills and enthusiasm. She is a \nmotivated young woman held in high esteem, and active in charitable events.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug use was contributed to by her youth, immaturity, and by peer \npressure. She is completing her senior year in college, which often has a maturing \neffect on an individual. College graduation often forms a line of demarcation in a \nperson\u2019s life between youth and adulthood. As she stated her illegal drug use were \nchoices made by a young, immature, and foolish teenager. \n \nApplicant asserts she is drug free, intends to remain drug free, and, as she \nmatures, the factors leading to her drug usage, including peer pressure, are no longer \nas large an influence on her life. Applicant\u2019s intentions are good. The recency of her last \nuse makes it difficult to ascertain the veracity of her assertion. Her last marijuana use \nwas eight months ago. She may indeed stay drug free. However, it is simply too soon to \nfind illegal drugs are no longer a part of her life. \n \nThe awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is \nbased on current disqualifying and mitigating conditions. Although the Applicant=s \nevidence of rehabilitation is insufficient at this time, should she in the future be afforded \nan opportunity to reapply for a security clearance, with the passage of sufficient \nadditional time, continued rehabilitation, and no future incidents of illegal drug usage or \nmisconduct, she may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security worthiness. \nBut that time has not yet arrived.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant. This usage is  \nincluded in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \nSubparagraph 1.c\u20141.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n10 \n\n \n11 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_____________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Applicant is 32, and married to her second husband. She is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admits all of the allegations in the SOR. The Applicant provided additional information concerning allegations 1.b., 1.c., 1.f., 1.g. and 1.h. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. The Applicant submits that the majority of her financial problems began because of her divorce from her first husband in 2005. (Item 5 at 5.) It is noted that the Applicant states she was divorced on September 21, 2005, in her official Government questionnaire. (Item 4, Section 15, at 19-20.) The e-QIP also states that the Applicant was employed until March 2006. (Item 4, Section 11, at 16.) The Applicant\u2019s responses 1 to the ten allegations in the SOR follow. 1.a. The Applicant admits that she is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $1,021.

Based upon a review of the written record\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 32, and married to her second husband.  She is employed by a\ndefense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her\nemployment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nshe is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Applicant admits all of the allegations in the SOR. The Applicant\nprovided additional information concerning allegations 1.b., 1.c., 1.f., 1.g. and 1.h.\nThose admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\nThe Applicant submits that the majority of her financial problems began because\nof her divorce from her first husband in 2005. (Item 5 at 5.) It is noted that the Applicant\nstates she was divorced on September 21, 2005, in her official Government\nquestionnaire. (Item 4, Section 15, at 19-20.)  The e-QIP also states that the Applicant\nwas employed until March 2006. (Item 4, Section 11, at 16.)  The Applicant\u2019s responses\n1\nto the ten allegations in the SOR follow.\n1.a.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to a creditor in the amount of\n$1,021. The Applicant has made no recent payments on this debt, and there is no\nevidence that she is going to make payments on this debt.\n1.b.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent\nstudent loan in the amount of $14,000. She states in her Answer to the SOR, \u201cThis\nshould not be under collection any long, as the debt is being paid at a rate of $409.00\nper month.\u201d The most recent credit report in the record, dated June 5, 2009, indicates\nthat the debt is, \u201cPaid or being paid by garnishment.\u201d (Item 8 at 2.) However, the\nApplicant submitted no information as to how many payments have been made, and\nwhat is the amount of her current balance.\n1.c.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent\nstudent loan in the amount of $10,000. The Applicant states that this debt is also being\npaid at the rate of $409 a month. The most recent credit report in the record, dated June\n5, 2009, indicates that the debt is, \u201cpaid or being paid by garnishment.\u201d (Item 8 at 2.)\nHowever, the Applicant submitted no information as to how many payments have been\nmade, and what is the amount of her current balance.   \n\n3\n1.d.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to a credit card company in the\namount of $381.  The Applicant has made no recent payments on this debt, and there is\nno evidence that she is going to make payments on this debt.\n1.e.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to a second credit card\ncompany in the amount of approximately $2,000.  The Applicant stated in October 2008\nthat she was making $100 payments on this debt. (Item 5 at 4.) She submitted no\ndocumentary evidence supporting her statement, or showing her current balance.\n1.f.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent\nstudent loan in the amount of $362. She states in her Answer to the SOR, \u201cAll . . .\nobligations are currently being paid at a total rate of $130.00 per month.\u201d The Applicant\nsubmitted copies of pages from a payment book of this creditor. The payment book\nindicates that the Applicant\u2019s monthly payment for two student loans was $127.71 as of\nApril 2009. (Item 6.) However, the Applicant submitted no information as to how many\npayments have been made, or showing her current balance. \n1.g.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent\nstudent loan in the amount of $253. She states in her Answer to the SOR, \u201cAll . . .\nobligations are currently being paid at a total rate of $130.00 per month.\u201d The Applicant\nsubmitted copies of pages from a payment book of this creditor. The payment book\nindicates that the Applicant\u2019s monthly payment for two student loans was $127.71 as of\nApril 2009. (Item 6.) However, the Applicant submitted no information as to how many\npayments have been made, or showing her current balance. \n1.h.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent\nstudent loan in the amount of $350. She states in her Answer to the SOR, \u201cAll . . .\nobligations are currently being paid at a total rate of $130.00 per month.\u201d The Applicant\nsubmitted copies of pages from a payment book of this creditor. The payment book\nindicates that the Applicant\u2019s monthly payment for two student loans was $127.71 as of\nApril 2009. (Item 6.) However, the Applicant submitted no information as to how many\npayments have been made, or showing her current balance. \n1.i.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $114.  The Applicant has made no recent payments on this debt, and there is\nno evidence that she is going to make payments on this debt.\n1.j.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to a telephone company in the\namount of $264.  The Applicant has made no recent payments on this debt, and there is\nno evidence that she is going to make payments on this debt.\nThe Applicant submitted evidence that she had applied for a loan with her credit\nunion. However, there is no evidence that she received it.  (Items 6 and 7.) \n\n4\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\n\n5\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by her own admission, has over $28,000 in past due\ndebts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose recently, primarily between about 2003 and 2008. In addition,\nshe failed to establish how much she has paid to any of her creditors. It is the\nApplicant\u2019s burden to submit evidence showing that her financial situation has improved.\nShe has not done so.  This mitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g.,. . . divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d  The Applicant and her husband were divorced in 2005. She indicates\nthat his actions exacerbated her financial situation. However, there is a scant record to\nconclude that she has acted responsibly since then. With the available record, I cannot\nfind, under these particular facts, that the Applicant has acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\nThe Applicant has barely initiated a good-faith effort to pay off her creditors.\nThere is no track record of her making payments for a consistent period of time.\nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  Finally, given the fact that she is $28,000 in\n\n6\ndebt, I cannot find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Applicant is under financial\nstrain, and has been so for several years. Her debt situation is not yet under control.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record,\nI cannot find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nAccordingly, at the present time, I find that there is the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)8)); and that there is a high likelihood of recurrence\n(AG \u00b6 2(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude the\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial situation at\nthis time.  If she continues to pay down her debts and is able to document these\npayments, she may be eligible for a clearance in the future.  She is not eligible now.\nOn balance, I conclude that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a denial of her request for a security clearance.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After his father became a U.S. citizen and registered voter, Applicant was granted U.S. citizenship in 2001.

On August\n27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn his September 11, 2009 response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the four\nallegations raised under Guideline B and the three allegations set forth under Guideline\nC. He also requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was\nultimately assigned to me on December 16, 2009. Department Counsel and Applicant\nagreed to a January 20, 2010, hearing date. A Notice of Hearing was issued by DOHA\nMarch 31, 2010\n\n Tr. 9-10.\n1\n Ex. 3 (Administrative Notice Memorandum, dated Nov. 2, 2009).\n2\n Id., citing to U.S. Department of State Travel W arnings: Phillippines, dated Nov. 2, 2009. It also notes that\n3\nforeign tourists are often targeted by these groups. It further notes the threat of terrorism and acts of violence\nagainst U.S. citizens and interests throughout the world.\n2\non January 13, 2010, setting the hearing for that date. Prior to and during the hearing,\nApplicant waived his right to a written 15-day notice regarding the hearing date.   \n1\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted three\nexhibits (Ex.) which were accepted into the record as Exs. 1-3 without objection.\nApplicant gave testimony and was accompanied by his wife, who also gave testimony.\nHe submitted 16 exhibits, accepted as Exs. A-P without objection. Applicant was given\nthrough February 2, 2010, to submit any additional materials. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on January 28, 2010. On February 26, 2010, Department Counsel forwarded\nfour additional documents from Applicant without objection, noting that all the\ndocuments had been timely received. They were accepted into the record as Exs. Q-T.\nThe record was closed on March 1, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file,\nexhibits, and testimony, security clearance is granted.\nAdministrative Notice\nThe Government requested administrative notice of certain facts and materials\nregarding the Republic of the Phillippines (Phillippines). The Phillippines is a multiparty\nrepublic. It has an elected president and bicameral legislature comprising a\nrepresentative democracy modeled on the United States\u2019 (U.S.) system. It is an ally of\nthe U.S. with ties dating back to 1898. The nation has experienced severe economic\ndecline since the end of World War II, as has its infrastructure and ability to provide\npolicy and regulatory stability.  These problems have become increasingly more\n2\nchallenging in the face of the growing presence and activity of such terrorist groups as\nAbu Sayyyaf (ASG), Jemaah Islamiya (JI), and the Rajah Solaiman Movement (RSM).\nTensions also exist between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front\n(MILF), which have resulted in MILF sponsored bombings, assassinations, and\nkidnappings. The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens contemplating travel to the\nPhillippines to be aware of the threat posed by such groups and other gangs that prey\non tourists. Specifically, it cites to the risks of travel to the regions of Mindanano and the\nSulu Archipelago, which are in the largest, southern-most islands in the country.3\nClashes between lawless groups and the Philippine Armed Forces, as well as kidnap-\nfor-ransom gangs, are also noted in specific provinces of Mindanao and the Sulu\n\n Id.\n4\n Id., citing to U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, Country Reports\n5\non Human Rights Practices: Phillippines (Human Rights Report), dated Feb. 25, 2009. Manila is also noted\nfor the sale of counterfeit goods; a bomb detonated near a Philippine government building in 2007 has been\nlinked to terrorist activity. See Philippines, Country Specific Information. U.S. Department of State.\n  Id., citing to U.S Department of State Background Note: Phillippines, dated Apr. 2009.\n6\n Id.\n7\n Id.\n8\n Puerto Princesa City is currently described as a \u201cmodel city\u201d noted for its cleanliness, environmental\n9\nprotection and conservation, and local governance.

Crime is considered high in Manila, the capital, and internal human rights\n4\nissues exist within the country.  \n5\nGeographically, the Phillippines is an archipelago comprising over 7,000 island,\nover 800 of which are occupied. It is broadly defined as consisting of three geographical\nregions (Luzon, Visayas, and Mindinao) spanning a vast area of approximately 117,187\nsquare miles. Its capital of Manila is to the north.  Traditionally, the U.S. has been the\n6\ncountry\u2019s largest investor.   \n7\nNearly 400,000 Americans visit the Phillippines each year.  A popular tourist\n8\nvenue is the isolated and narrow strip situated to the southwest of Mimaropa known as\nPalawan Island, which includes Puerto Princesa City, just north of the island\u2019s center.9\nDistant from the rest of the country, Palawan is noted for its tropical beauty, exotic\nbeaches, scuba diving, landscape, nature, and minerals; it has more protected areas\nthan any other region of the Phillippines.  Palawan Island is located to the southwest of\n10\nthe Luzon region, separated by the Mindoro Strait and the North Bay. It is situated\nbetween the Sulu Sea and the South China Sea. Palawan Island is a considerable\ndistance south by southwest from Manila. The distance to the inland area of Mindanao,\nwhich is to the east across the Sulu Sea, past the Zamboanga Strip, and across the\nMoro Gulf, is much further. The Sulu Peninsula is even further south, located where the\nSulu Sea meets Malaysia. All the documents contained within the government\u2019s request\nfor administrative notice regarding the Phillippines (Ex. 3) have been reviewed and\ngiven due consideration in light of the particular facts of this case, as have\nsupplemental documents submitted by Applicant.  \n11\n\n Applicant\u2019s brother and sister also became U.S. citizens.\n12\n The SOR inaccurately states that the trip Applicant took after college was in 2007. See, e.g., Tr. 56. \n13\n See Tr. 56.\n14\n Tr. 16, 20, 78-79.\n15\n Ex. R, supra, note 10.\n16\n Tr. 73, 78-79. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t look like his citizenship [was] directly related to preserving a property interest\n17\nat that time, so as to buy property, or something like that.\u201d See also Ex. R, supra, note 10.\n4\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 26-year-old test technician who has worked for the same defense\ncontractor since June 2008. Born in 1983, he moved to the U.S. with his mother and\nsiblings in 1992. The family joined Applicant\u2019s father, who had moved to the U.S. in\n1986. After his father became a U.S. citizen and registered voter, Applicant was granted\nU.S. citizenship in 2001.  He later received a U.S. passport, which he used to visit the\n12\nPhillippines for three weeks after he graduated from high school in order to see his\nchildhood homeland. In May 2006, Applicant received an undergraduate degree from\nan American state university. Following graduation, he traveled on his U.S. passport to\nthe Phillippines for a three-week vacation.  On that trip, a leisure trip planned as a\n13\ngraduation present, he traveled with a cousin who now lives in the Philippines and with\nwhom Applicant now maintains no contact.  He has not returned to the Phillippines\n14\nsince that vacation. In early 2007, shortly after Applicant started his first post-collegiate\nprofessional position, Applicant\u2019s father, a dual U.S.-Phillippines citizen, urged him to\nreestablish dual citizenship with the Phillippines. His father argued that such a\nreestablishment was a good idea because \u201cit was good for . . . business opportunities in\nthe Phillippines.\u201d  Although he had no personal or business plans which dual-\n15\ncitizenship would promote,  Applicant complied with his father\u2019s request, became a\n16\ndual citizen, and, on November 7, 2007, received a Philippine passport.   He never\n17\n\n Tr. 23, 66. Consideration of App. Bd. Dec. 01-00677 is urged to show a previous denial of a security\n18\nclearance where an applicant did not wish to \u201cshare allegiance with [another] country, they just wanted to join\na softball team, something as innocent as that, the idea of getting out and getting citizenship is a big deal.\u201d\nTr. 78-79. The acquisition of citizenship in another country while a U.S. citizen is a major issue and raises\ngenuine concerns.  The case cited, however, is more complex and highly distinguishable on the facts. There,\nthe applicant sought the acquisition of a foreign citizenship to maintain \u201cprofessional and [\u2018particularly close\u2019]\npersonal ties to two high-level [foreign country] softball officials,\u201d demonstrated a high present interest in\npromoting that team, served as a representative in the foreign country\u2019s international softball team as an\numpire, coach, and non-voting delegate, and was using his involvement to promote his \u201cdream of umpiring\nat the Olympics.\u201d Consequently, that applicant\u2019s activities and his association with the two high-level officials\nwere deemed to \u201cplace them in a position to exercise influence over\u201d that applicant. W hile this Applicant\u2019s\nacquisition of dual citizenship was also a matter raising genuine concerns, the evidence and Applicant\u2019s highly\ncredible testimony indicate that it was done solely to placate his father\u2019s wishes.

The facts show that Applicant\u2019s father lost his job in the\nU.S., returned to the Philippines, and eventually started his own business well after Applicant had already\nbecome a dual-citizen and a Philippine passport holder.

Had he known of the potential ramifications of his\n18\nactions, he would not have proceeded with the idea.  \nAt some point around the time Applicant became a dual citizen, his father was\nlaid off from his job as a mechanical engineer. His father returned to the Phillippines for\nwork in April 2008.  He moved to Puerto Princesa City, Palawan Island. The isolated\n19\nisland is south by southwest of Manila. There, he and his wife owned some land about\nfive minutes from the airport.  There, he started a business and began constructing a\n20\nhotel and retail complex on his property. He remains a resident of Palawan Island,\nwhere he manages his hotel.  Busy with his hotel, Applicant\u2019s father, now 58 years old,\n21\nhas no immediate plans to return to the U.S.  He hopes Applicant or his siblings might\n22\nsomeday become involved in his business in some capacity.  The business is worth\n23\napproximately $100,000. If Applicant\u2019s father were to keep and ultimately leave the\nbusiness to his children, it is possible the three children could take evenly divided\ninterests, but their father\u2019s future plans for the project, if any, are unknown.  \n24\n\n See also Tr. 46.

It is\nvalued at about $600,000. They each pay under $300 a month on the finance plan,\nwhich, with interest, will ultimately require the joint payment of about $75,000.  The\n27\nbuilding is not expected to be finished before 2012. On completion, the unit will be fully\nfurnished.  Thus far, Applicant has paid about $6,000 toward the joint investment.  \n28\n29\nOn November 25, 2009, Applicant renounced his dual citizenship with the\nPhillippines; his passport from the Phillippines was cancelled and returned.

Jan. 27, 1995).\n47\n8\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand commonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative\njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n46\npreponderance of evidence. The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n47\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\n\n Id.\n48\n Id.\n49\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n50\n AG \u00b6 9.\n51\n AG \u00b6 10(a). \n52\n9\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n48\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n49\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n50\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference) and Guideline B (Foreign Contacts) to be the most pertinent to the case.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such\nconcerns, are discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline C \u2013 Foreign Preference. \nThe concern regarding foreign preference is that when an individual acts in such\na way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he or she\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the U.S.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\n51\ninclude exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  \n52\nThe SOR contains three allegations. First, Applicant re-established Philippine\ncitizenship in about February 2007 after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in June\n2001. Second, that he did so in order to acquire, along with his father and brother, a\nbusiness interest in the Philippines. Third, that he applied for and now possesses a\ncurrent Philippine passport that was issued in November 2007 with an expiration date in\nNovember 2012. Such facts, if established by substantial evidence, would be sufficient\nto raise Foreign Preference Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 10(a) (exercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member. This includes, but is not limited to (1)\npossession of a current foreign passport. . . , (5) using foreign citizenship to protect\n\n See Tr. 73.\n53\n10\nfinancial or business interests in another country. . . .),  and AG \u00b610(b) (action to\nacquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen). With\nforeign preference disqualifying conditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to\nmitigate security concerns.\nAs a threshold matter, there is no evidence that Applicant reestablished\ncitizenship with the Philippines in order to acquire, further, or protect a business interest\nin the Philippines along with his father and brother, as noted in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.b.\nApplicant\u2019s father independently started a business and commenced construction on a\nhotel complex in the Philippines using his own land. Neither of his sons is connected to\nthat business. Applicant neither invested in, nor derives income from that business.\nMoreover, there is no indication he has any future interest in his father\u2019s yet to be\ncompleted business. At most,  he might receive a share of the business should his\nfather maintain the business for his lifetime and leave ownership to his children in\nshares. At present, however, he has expressed no such intention and Applicant has no\nexpectation of a future interest. Consequently, with regard to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.b, AG\n\u00b6 10(a)(5) is not applicable.  \n53\nApplicant did, however, acquire dual citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen. He\nalso applied for and received a Philippine passport after undergraduate school. His\nqualification for this re-establishment was the fact that he was born in the Philippines to\nparents who were then citizens of that country. He sought re-establishment of his\nPhilippine citizenship at his father\u2019s urging, not as a demonstration of support for the\nPhilippines. He has since effectively renounced that citizenship. He also acquired a\nPhilippine passport in 2007, which he never used. He has since returned that passport\nto the appropriate Philippine authorities and it has been cancelled. Consequently,\nForeign Preference Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely\non parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country), \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship), and AG \u00b6 11(e) (the passport\nhas been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated) all apply.\nWhen Applicant graduated from college and was first beginning his career, his\nfather urged him to seek dual citizenship to expand his professional options. He dutifully\ncomplied with his father\u2019s wishes. He remained, however, in this country. There is no\nevidence he ever considered leaving the U.S., his siblings, his friends, or his community\nin favor of employment or life in any other country. Indeed, Applicant did not follow his\nfather back to Palawan Island for work, nor did he join his father in his current business\nenterprise there. Instead, he remained in the U.S., moved on to a more challenging\ncareer, married, and integrated himself further into his community. He voluntarily\nrelinquished his dual citizenship when apprised that its acquisition had unforeseen\nprofessional repercussions antithetical to his father\u2019s advice. He similarly surrendered\nhis unused Philippine passport to Philippine authorities. It has since been canceled.\n\n Ex. 3, supra, note 2, citing to U.S. Department of State Travel W arnings: Phillippines, dated Nov. 2, 2009.\n54\n Also noted is the high crime in distant Manila, where one bombing incident occurred near a Philippine\n55\ngovernment building in 2007. It was linked to probable terrorist activity. \n11\nAny suggestion that he has a preference for the Philippines over the U.S., or is prone to\nprovide information or make decisions harmful to U.S. interests have been dispelled.\nForeign preference security concerns have been mitigated.\nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence\nThe concern under Guideline B is that foreign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government\nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest. The adjudication can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S.\ncitizens to obtain protected information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are\nset forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nThe country at issue is the Philippines. It has long-standing ties with the U.S.\nUnfortunately, instances of civil unrest and governmental deviation from its constitution\nhave been noted, particularly with regard to its capital. Moreover, terrorist groups\nmaintain a foothold in that country to the extent that the U.S. State Department has\nissued a travel warning advising U.S. citizens of the risks of travel to the southern\nPhilippine islands of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago.  In noting the fact that the\n54\nthreat of terrorism and acts of violence against U.S. citizens and interests remain a\nconcern throughout the world, it also notes that foreign tourists to those areas of the\nPhilippines are often targeted by these groups.  Consequently, although the targeting\n55\nof tourists and U.S. citizens is associated with violence, crime, and terrorist activity,\nalbeit not with regard to the acquisition of protected information, the risk of terrorism\ndescribed provides sufficient grounds to give issues regarding foreign influence\nheightened and serious scrutiny.   \nThe SOR contained four allegations under this guideline. First, that Applicant\u2019s\nfather is a dual citizen of the U.S. and the Philippines who frequently \u201cvisits and resides\u201d\nin the Philippines. Second, that Applicant purchased a share in a real estate investment\nin the Philippines, a condominium under construction valued at about $60,000. Third,\n\n As noted above and at Tr. 73, no evidence was presented by the government indicating that Applicant has\n56\na business interest in his father\u2019s business. Applicant\u2019s credible testimony, as well as his materials, support\nthe conclusion that this allegation is erroneous.\n The areas noted for terrorist activity are significantly distant from the Philippine shorelines facing Palawan.\n57\n12\nthat Applicant has an interest in a business incorporated by his father in the\nPhilippines.  Fourth, that he traveled to the Philippines in 2002 and 2007.  \n56\nApplicant\u2019s father is a dual citizen of the U.S. and the Philippines who recently\nreturned to the Philippines after being laid off from his work in the U.S. There, he now\nmanages his own business. Applicant has visited the Philippines twice since\nimmigrating to the U.S. at the age of nine, visiting on leisure trips following his\ngraduations from high school and college in 2002 and 2006, respectively. He and his\nbrother jointly financed the purchase of a $60,000 condominium unit for about $75,000.\nSuch facts are sufficient to give rise to Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6\n7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend,\nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates\na heightened risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion), AG\n\u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information), and AG \u00b6 7(e) (a substantial business, financial,\nor property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated\nbusiness, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation). With disqualifying conditions thus raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to\nmitigate security concerns.\nApplicant cares for his father and the evidence shows that he has been an\nobedient son, following his elder\u2019s advice and counsel. Consequently, Foreign Influence\nMitigating Condition AG \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so\ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s father\u2019s residence and his business, however, are in a remote and\nisolated area, an island and eco-sanctuary sufficiently distant from those areas of U.S.\nState Department concern within the Philippines to constitute an entirely different land,\nsuch as the nearby Spratley Islands. Palawan Island is not noted for social discord or\nterrorism.  Its epicenter, Puerto Princesa City, is referred to as a model city for a\n57\nvariety of positive attributes, including its governance. It has at a nearby airport\npermitting access to the island and Applicant\u2019s business, obviating the need to traverse\nthrough the rest of the Philippines to get to Puerto Princesa City. Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s\nbusiness, the construction and future maintenance of a hotel and retail complex,\nundoubtedly employs local residents, thus benefitting the local population and\ngovernment of this comparatively peaceful and resort-oriented region. Resplendent in\n\n13\nits geographic isolation and noted for its local governmental stability, it is unlikely that\nApplicant\u2019s father or his business would be influenced or exploited to the disadvantage\nof his son or the state. Therefore, AG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) and AG \u00b6 8(c) (contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation) apply. \nMoreover, there is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s loyalties or sense of obligation\nare directed toward any country or lifestyle other than those he has found and\ndeveloped in the U.S. Although he became a resident as a minor, he chose to remain in\nthe U.S. to pursue his college degree. He chose to pursue his professional path in the\nU.S., despite his father\u2019s urging to consider both the U.S. and the Philippines with\nregard to business opportunities. He and his wife have every intention of remaining in\nthe U.S., where Applicant spent the majority of his childhood. He was educated and has\nmade friends here, and he has fully integrated himself within his local community. His\ntwo trips to the Philippines were graduation gifts taken only for pleasure. There is no\nevidence he traveled  to re-establish or maintain social ties. Indeed, he no longer\nmaintains his friendship with the cousin with whom he traveled in 2006. Except for his\nfather, with whom he chose not to join in the Philippines on his father\u2019s business\nventure, all his ties are based here. \nFurthermore, regarding the condominium at issue, it is not expected to be fully\nconstructed until at least 2012. The primary purpose for its acquisition was as a future\nrental property, not as a home for Applicant. Applicant\u2019s personal payments toward the\nproperty are under $300 a month, half the monthly payment of the approximately $572\nobligation he splits with his brother, a U.S. Marine. Applicant\u2019s total payments on the\nproperty amount to only about $6,000. Inasmuch as it is not yet completed, its actual\nand potential value cannot truly be determined. It does not, however, represent a\nsubstantial investment or financial commitment on the part of Applicant and his wife in\ncontrast to his steady employment situation and the stable life he maintains in the U.S.\nGiven all of these  facts,  AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest) and AG \u00b6 8(f) (the value or routine nature of the\nforeign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in\nconflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the\nindividual) apply. \nApplicant\u2019s factual situation is highly unique. The Philippines has suffered from a\ndeclining economy as threats from domestic turmoil and a growing terrorist presence\nhave risen. Applicant\u2019s father, his father\u2019s business, and Applicant\u2019s condominium\n\n14\ninvestment, however, are all in the middle of a comparatively thriving resort island,\naccessible by air. While other countries riddled with crime and terrorist concerns in one\nor more areas may condemn them to an overall negative assessment in terms of\nsecurity, the Philippines, comprised as it is of a sprawling chain of islands, is distinct.\nThat distinction with regard to Palawa is highly notable even in light of the heightened\nscrutiny the Philippines merits. \nMoreover, Palawan is noted for its eco-tourism, remote location, and model\ngovernance. Such factors that have helped it maintain a region isolated from the\nconcerns that have besieged the southern Philippine islands of Mindanao and the Sulu\nArchipelago, as well as the governmental and civil infractions occurring elsewhere in the\ncountry. There is no evidence that the country is known for targeting U.S. citizens for\nthe purpose of obtaining protected U.S. information. Nor is there evidence that the\nisland of Palawan or the city central city of Puerto Princesa is associated with any risk\nof terrorism. Lacking any evidence that Applicant\u2019s loyalties are in any way divided or\nthat his father or their respective business interests can be manipulated or made\nvulnerable to the whims of governmental or terrorist interests, foreign influence security\nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a) \u2013  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances \nsurrounding \nthe \nconduct, \nto \ninclude \nknowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a credible, forthright, and happily settled young man with excellent\neducational and professional credentials. He re-established dual citizenship with the\nPhilippines only as a gesture to honor his father\u2019s advice. When he discovered that his\nfather\u2019s counsel could jeopardize the stable employment and lifestyle he enjoys in the\n\n15\nU.S. as an American citizen, he voluntarily and expeditiously renounced his Philippine\ncitizenship and returned his passport. He purchased a condominium unit with his\nbrother as a prudent investment, based on his mother\u2019s more seasoned, professional\nadvice. In the nearly two decades since his immigration, he has fully become\n\u201cAmericanized.\u201d His two leisure trips to the Philippines were merely graduation gifts\nfrom proud parents of an academically successful son. Applicant\u2019s siblings have both\nserved as members of the U.S. armed forces. Neither he nor his wife have any intention\nof leaving the U.S. He maintains no significant ties with the Philippines except for his\nfather and his modest investment in Palawan.\nAt the same time, considerations working against Applicant include his father\u2019s\ncurrent residence in the Philippines and Applicant\u2019s acquisition of that modest\ncondominium. Both, however, are located on the island of Palawan, an island\ngeographically separated from the rest of the Philippines and quite distant from those\nareas regarding which the U.S. State Department has expressed vehement concern\nand which necessitate heightened scrutiny of the country. In its isolation, separated\nfrom the rest of the country by significant bodies of water, the island has thrived as an\neco-friendly tourist hub. Puerto Princesa as an acknowledged model city with regard to\nits many assets, including its governance. There is no evidence that civil unrest,\nnational governmental interference, uncommonly high crime, terrorism, or the targeting\nof U.S. tourists for any purpose has infiltrated this island. Consequently, neither\nApplicant\u2019s father nor his business are at risk. Similarly, the island\u2019s stability protects\nApplicant modest investment in an incomplete potential rental property, toward which\nApplicant makes nominal monthly payments and has yet to invest more than 10% of the\nloan taken by Applicant and his brother, a U.S. Marine.  \nThere is no way to predict the future of the Philippines in terms of its declining\neconomy, government, its citizenry, or either the presence of terrorist groups in its most\nsouth-eastern province or crime in metropolitan Manila. Given Palawan\u2019s isolation,\nreputation, attributes, and popularity as a leisure destination, however, it appears to be\nable to maintain its comparatively thriving situation without incident or cause for\nconcern. Should that situation ever change or should the specter of exploitation or\nterrorism ever encroach, Applicant\u2019s and his family are sufficiently savvy with regard to\nthe Philippines to sense that change and make any needed adjustments expeditiously.\nGiven these considerations, I conclude it is clearly consistent with national security to\ngrant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance granted.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n16\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He \ndid not make sufficient progress resolving his delinquent debts. Applicant failed to \nmitigate financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 17, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On May 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 8), pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nAugust 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn June 5, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 9). On June 25, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed. On July 1, 2009, the case was assigned \nto me. On July 2, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 7). On July 21, 2009, \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was held. Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GE 1-6) \n(Transcript (Tr.) 16), and Applicant offered one exhibit at the hearing (Tr. 30-31; AE A).  \nApplicant did not object to my consideration of GE 1-6, and Department Counsel did not \nobject to my consideration of AE A (Tr. 16, 31). I admitted GE 1-6 and AE A into \nevidence (Tr. 16, 31). Additionally, I admitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response \nto the SOR (GE 7-9). On July 24, 2009, I received the transcript of the hearing. On \nAugust 3, 2009, I received AE B and C. Department Counsel did not object to my \nconsideration of AE B and C, and I admitted them into evidence.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied knowledge of most of the SOR debts. \nHe asserted several were satisfied, or he was working out a payment plan with the \nparticular creditor concerned (GE 9). He thought the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.o were \nsatisfied (GE 9). For the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s to 1.v, he said, \u201cpayment installments \nhave been made and are in progress\u201d (GE 9). His admissions are accepted as findings \nof fact. \n  \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 5). He has \nworked for his current employer since April 2003 as a security guard or supervisor of \nsecurity guards (Tr. 42). He graduated from high school in 1989, and attended a \nuniversity from 1989 to 1993 (Tr. 5). He did not receive a degree from the university (Tr. \n5). He does not currently hold a security clearance and has not held a security \nclearance in the past (Tr. 6-7). \n \nApplicant married in 1996 and divorced in 2000 (GE 1). His twin children were \nborn in 1996 (GE 1). He never served in the military (GE 1). He remarried in December \n2008 (Tr. 38). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant has not been unemployed in more than ten years (Tr. 40).

He is current on \nhis state and federal income taxes (Tr. 41).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($1,343). Applicant had a telecommunications account related to the \ncollection agent in SOR \u00b6 1.a (Tr. 18). He thought his debt was resolved when he paid \nthe creditor $500. He said his account was \u201cmessed up\u201d; however, he intended to pay \nthis debt (Tr. 18-19). After his hearing, he called the creditor and is now waiting for a \nresponse from the creditor (AE C).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($104). Applicant had a medical account, which he thought was \nrelated to his two children (Tr. 19).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($100). Applicant had a medical account, which he said he planned to \npay (Tr. 28).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($2,596). Applicant did not recognize this account (Tr. 28). Two \nweeks before his hearing he contacted the credit reporting company to find out about \nthe account. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($741). Applicant had a cable account with this creditor (Tr. 29). He \nturned in his equipment and closed his account (Tr. 29). He did not understand why he \nowed this debt (Tr. 29). After his hearing, he contacted the creditor and asked for \ninformation about the debt (AE C). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,457). The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f pertains to a collection agency (Tr. \n29). He did not recognize the account (Tr. 29). He intends to investigate and resolve the \ndebt (Tr. 29-30). After his hearing, he telephoned the creditor and asked for information \nabout the debt (AE C). The creditor told Applicant to send a letter and they would try to \nresolve the matter (AE C). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($8,673). The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g pertains to a vehicle loan account \n(Tr. 20, 21). Applicant returned the vehicle to the creditor (Tr. 21). The creditor sent \nApplicant a settlement offer for $1,700 (Tr. 20, 21). Applicant offered to pay $100 per \nmonth; however, he had not heard the result from the creditor (Tr. 20). He said he left \ndocumentation about this account at his home and did not bring it to the hearing (Tr. \n21). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($712). The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h pertains to a collection agency. On \nJune 29, 2009, he received an offer to settle this debt for $499 and he provided a copy \nof the settlement proposal (Tr. 30; AE A). Applicant intends to follow-up on this \nsettlement offer (Tr. 32). \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($177) and 1.j ($464). These two debts are from collection agencies \nand Applicant did not recognize the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j (Tr. 32).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($511).  This debt pertains to a telecommunications account (Tr. 32-\n33). He said he made one $40 payment in June 2009 (Tr. 33). He intended to continue \nto make payments on this debt (Tr. 32-33).   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($509). Applicant admitted responsibility for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l and \nsaid he was going to make his first $40 payment the Friday after the hearing (Tr. 22). \nHe thought maybe the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.k and \u00b6 1.l were the same debt (Tr. 33). After \nthe hearing, he noted he is still waiting for the installment agreement (AE C).    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($13,000). Applicant admitted responsibility for the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.m, which pertains to a vehicle loan account (Tr. 22, 21). Applicant returned the vehicle \nto the creditor (Tr. 23). Applicant is waiting for the creditor to send him a settlement offer \n(Tr. 23).  \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n ($148) and 1.o \n($718) (Tr. 22). He said he paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.o (Tr. 24, 25). These \ndebts were possibly paid last year (Tr. 25). He was unable to locate documentation \nshowing the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o was paid (AE C). \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p ($1,060), 1.q ($162), 1.r ($1,362), 1.x ($103). Applicant did not \nrecognize these four debts (Tr. 33-35). \n \nApplicant said he was making payment arrangements for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.s ($392), 1.t ($222), 1.u ($936), and 1.v ($138). He was waiting to hear from the \ncreditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t, 1.u, and 1.v (Tr. 26). After his hearing, he provided an undated \nletter to the creditor asking for information about the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t, 1.u, and \n1.v (AE B). Although Applicant had previously indicated he had payment arrangements \nand would resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.v by June 2009, the creditor advised him the \ndebt for $138 was resolved and he did not owe anything (Tr. 27). He thought he had \nproof of satisfaction of the account in SOR \u00b6 1.v in a closet; however, he was worried \nthat he lost the proof in a move (Tr. 27).   \n   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.w ($318). This is a telecommunications debt (Tr. 34). About two years \nago Applicant contacted the creditor and asked the creditor to add the debt to his \ncurrent account (Tr. 34-35). His account with the creditor was current (Tr. 35). After the \nhearing, the creditor advised him that he would soon receive a bill for $318 (AE C).  \n \nAppellant has not received any credit counseling (Tr. 36). He did not attempt to \nresolve most of his SOR debts prior to his hearing because of a lack of funds (Tr. 36). \nApplicant and his spouse earn about $5,300 monthly (Tr. 37-38). He listed monthly \nexpenses are as follows: rent ($2,500), car payment ($630), and child support ($600) \n(Tr. 38-39). He has about $150 left at the end of the month (Tr. 39). In their marriage, \nApplicant pays the rent, his car payment, and his child support, and his wife pays for \neverything else (Tr. 38-39).  Applicant does not have any savings (Tr. 40).     \n \nApplicant said he kept copies of his correspondence to the creditors, and I held \nthe record open for ten days so that Applicant could provide copies for the record of \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ndocumentation showing his investigative efforts, payment plans, and anything else he \nbelieved would be helpful to his case (Tr. 23).  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \n\u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was sufficient to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that \nare of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is also documented in his \nSOR response, his oral statement at his hearing, and the documentation he submitted. \nHe failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The government established the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability \nof mitigating conditions is required. \n  \n   \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-20(e) are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant\u2019s SOR lists 24 debts totaling \nabout $35,946. He did not recognize several debts. He thought several other debts \nwere paid or resolved. He is investigating several debts. Important documentation about \nhis debts was lost during a move. He did not provide documentary evidence of any \npayments or paid SOR debts. It is particularly clear that he has not made significant \nprogress on resolution of four SOR debts totaling about $22,000: \u00b6 1.c ($100), \u00b6 1.g \n($8,673), \u00b6 1.h ($712), and \u00b6 1.m ($13,000). Applicant admitted responsibility for these \nfour SOR debts; however, he failed to provide documentation to establish the resolution \nof these accounts. Applicant has about $22,000 in unresolved, delinquent debt, and this \nsubstantial unresolved debt continues to \u201ccast doubt on [his] current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because a transfer reduced his \nsalary and caused a decrease in his hourly pay. Despite this issue, he does not receive \nfull mitigating credit because he did not establish that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.2   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant did not receive financial counseling. \nFinancial counseling would be very helpful to Applicant because he is evidently not \nsophisticated about budgeting and financial matters. There are not \u201cclear indications \n \n2\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d because most of the SOR debts \ntotaling about $30,000 remain unresolved. He has also established some, but not full \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because he showed some, recent good faith3 in the \nresolution of his debts and by contacting some SOR creditors and seeking to begin \npayment plans. Applicant did not provide documentation contesting the validity of any \ndebts, and AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. In the last year, his efforts to document the \nresolution of most of his SOR debt have been inadequate. Applicant was given \nadditional time after his hearing to obtain more information about his efforts to resolve \nhis SOR debts. His response on August 3, 2009, did not provide additional, meaningful \nassistance in resolving the status of his SOR debts. He did not provide sufficient \ninformation about his finances and debt resolution to establish his financial \nresponsibility.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n \nApplicant provided some important mitigating evidence under the whole person \nconcept. There is no evidence of any security violation(s). He is generally a law-abiding \ncitizen. His current financial problems were partially caused by a factor beyond his \ncontrol, that is, decreased income due to a transfer.     \n \nApplicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, \ndemonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. He graduated from high \nschool and earned credits towards a university degree. His employment history and \ncontributions to a defense contractor speak well for his character. He understands the \nimportance of a budget and what he needs to do to establish his financial responsibility. \nApplicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through his \nservice to the Department of Defense as a contractor. These factors, especially his past \ngovernment service, show substantial responsibility.  \n \nThe evidence under the whole person concept against mitigating Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial conduct is more substantial. Applicant\u2019s SOR lists 24 debts totaling about \n$35,946. The SOR was based on his credit reports. He did not recognize several debts. \nHe thought several other debts were paid or resolved. He is investigating several debts. \nImportant documentation about his debts was lost during a move. It is clear that he has \nnot made sufficient progress on resolution of four SOR debts totaling about $22,000: \u00b6 \n1.c ($100), \u00b6 1.g ($8,673), \u00b6 1.h ($712), and \u00b6 1.m ($13,000). Applicant admitted \nresponsibility for these four SOR debts; however, he failed to provide sufficient \ndocumentation to establish the resolution of these accounts. He did not provide \ndocumentation showing payment or resolution of any SOR debts. These debts have \nbeen delinquent for a substantial period of time. He did not meet his evidentiary burden \nof establishing his plan to resolve or actual resolution of these four debts. He has not \npaid anything to these four creditors in the past several years. Ultimately, he did not \nestablish that he acted with sufficient effort and self-discipline to resolve these four \ndelinquent debts and to better document his remedial efforts. All the factors considered \ntogether show too much financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of \ndelinquent debt raises unmitigated security concerns.   \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not sufficiently \nmitigated financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nhas not fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d to 1.f:  \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.g and 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i to 1.l:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n to 1.x:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMARK HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",
