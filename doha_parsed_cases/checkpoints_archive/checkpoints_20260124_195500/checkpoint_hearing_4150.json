(Transcript (Tr.) at 27-29) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since May 2022. He is applying for a security clearance for the first \ntime. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017, and he attended post-graduate classes in \n2017. He married in 2019. He and his wife have a child together; he adopted one of his \nwife\u2019s children; and he has a stepchild. (Tr. at 15-16; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts, however the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h is not a \nvalid debt. The 17 remaining SOR debts, as amended, consist of 16 debts with \nbalances totaling about $62,000 and a mortgage loan that was $34,853 past due with a \nbalance of $285,374. Applicant admitted owing all of the debts. (Tr. at 26; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2-3) \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to his 2018 marriage, where he went \nfrom providing only for himself to instantly having a family of four, which increased by \nanother when his child was born. He and his family moved to another city in 2020 for a \nbetter job opportunity. The costs associated with the move placed a financial burden on \nhim. He also admitted that he made poor financial decisions and lived beyond his \nmeans. (Tr. at 12-13; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \nApplicant and his wife bought a new home in about February 2020 in the location \nwhere they moved. The mortgage payments were $2,288 per month for 360 months (30 \nyears). He quickly realized that he could not maintain the mortgage payments. They \nmoved out and rented a condominium for $1,500 per month. The July 2022 credit report \nlists the mortgage account as $34,853 past due with a balance of $285,374. Applicant \nwas unable to sell or otherwise resolve the loan before the property was foreclosed. The \nMarch 2023 credit report lists the account as in foreclosure with a $0 balance. (Tr. at 21-\n22; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \nApplicant has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR. His wife is employed. \nHe stated that his family\u2019s expenses are about $1,000 greater each month than their \nincome, and they are living paycheck to paycheck. He has not received financial \ncounseling. He and his wife own two vehicles, including one that was financed in March \n2020 with a loan of about $54,800. He is looking for a second job to make up some of \nthe difference. He stated that he expects his financial situation and income to improve, \nwhich will enable him to start paying his debts. He has about $38,000 in federal student \nloans that are currently paused by COVID-19 relief and in good standing, but he will \nhave to resume paying them at some point. He also accrued a few additional minor \ndelinquent debts that were not alleged in the SOR and will not be used for \ndisqualification purposes but may be considered in the application of mitigating \nconditions.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and a \nforeclosed mortgage loan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h is not a valid debt. SOR \u00b6 1.h is concluded for \nApplicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to his 2018 marriage, where he went \nfrom providing only for himself to instantly having a family of four, which increased by \nanother when his child was born. He and his family moved to another city in 2020 for a \nbetter job opportunity. The costs associated with the move placed a financial burden on \nhim. He also admitted that he made poor financial decisions and lived beyond his \nmeans. \nApplicant has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR. His wife is \nemployed, but his family\u2019s expenses are about $1,000 greater each month than their \nincome, and they are living paycheck to paycheck. He and his wife own two vehicles, \nincluding one that was financed in March 2020 with a loan of about $54,800. He stated \nthat he is looking for a second job and plans to pay his debts. However, intentions to \nresolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through 20(d) do not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s Answer, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. His admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 31 years old. He married in February 2013 and divorced in July 2014. (Item 3 at 7 and 22.) He pays monthly child support for a child from a previous relationship. (Item 4 at 3.) Applicant served honorably in the U.S. Navy from 2011 to 2015. He attended a state university from August 2014 to May 2016 and earned an associate degree. From June 2017 to present, he has been a full-time student. While in school, he worked part time jobs. In his November 2021 security clearance interview he cited his child support obligation; a one-year period that he did not work while a student; and working low paying jobs after leaving the military for his financial difficulties. (Item 4.) He has been employed full time since October 2022 by a non-government employer. He received an interim clearance in November 2021. Applicant\u2019s four delinquent debts total over $56,165. The debts are established by two credit reports, and November 2021 security clearance interview. (Items 3-6.) He did not disclose any of his debts on his SCA. (Item 3.) The specific debts in the SOR are as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a: past-due auto loan placed for collection in the amount of $47,650. This debt was charged off in 2016. (Item 5 at 2 and Item 6 at 2.)

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 7, 2021. \nOn December 1, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DoD acted under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

He received the FORM on January 28, 2023. He provided two letters, which \nappear to be duplicates, as a Response. They are marked as AE-B and AE-C. The case \nwas assigned to me on April 3, 2023. \nThe SOR and the Answer (Items 1 and 2) are the pleadings in the case. FORM \nItems 3 through 7 and AE-A through AE-C are admitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. His admissions are \nincorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. He married in February 2013 and divorced in July 2014. \n(Item 3 at 7 and 22.) He pays monthly child support for a child from a previous relationship. \n(Item 4 at 3.) \nApplicant served honorably in the U.S. Navy from 2011 to 2015. He attended a \nstate university from August 2014 to May 2016 and earned an associate degree. From \nJune 2017 to present, he has been a full-time student. While in school, he worked part \ntime jobs. In his November 2021 security clearance interview he cited his child support \nobligation; a one-year period that he did not work while a student; and working low paying \njobs after leaving the military for his financial difficulties. (Item 4.) He has been employed \nfull time since October 2022 by a non-government employer. He received an interim \nclearance in November 2021. \nApplicant\u2019s four delinquent debts total over $56,165. The debts are established by \ntwo credit reports, and November 2021 security clearance interview. (Items 3-6.) He did \nnot disclose any of his debts on his SCA. (Item 3.) The specific debts in the SOR are as \nfollows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: past-due auto loan placed for collection in the amount of $47,650. \nThis debt was charged off in 2016. (Item 5 at 2 and Item 6 at 2.) Applicant notes in his \nAnswer that he is in the progress of resolving this debt. The most recent credit report \ndated July 15, 2022, shows the loan amount as $65,969, with a balance of $47,650. (Item \n5 at 2.) The November 18, 2021 credit report shows a balance of $43,788. (Item 6 at 2.) \nIn his Answer, Applicant states he was not able to continue to pay the loan because of \nhis responsibilities at the time to his schoolwork, and that he did not have the financial \nresources to support himself and pay the loan. He declares, without corroboration, that \nhe is currently working with the creditor to settle the debt and that it will be paid off in a \ntimely manner (Answer at 1.) In his November 2021 security clearance interview, he told \nthe investigator he did not have any knowledge of the debt and would have to investigate \nto see if he was responsible for the debt.

This debt was charged off in 2016. (Item 5 at 2 and Item 6 at 3.) \nApplicant in his Answer states he has been making payments on the account for the past \nyear. In his Response, he included AE-B and AE-C, both dated January 20, 2023, which \nshow he is following a payment arrangement for the debt. The payment arrangement was \nestablished in April 2022 and requires him to make monthly payments of $150. He has \npaid $1,500 towards the debt and has a remaining balance of $6,500. In his security \nclearance interview, he cited periods of unemployment and low paying jobs for why he \ncould not pay this debt. (Item 4 at 7.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: past-due utility account placed for collection in the amount of \n$462. (Item 5 at 2-3.) Applicant states in his Answer the debt has been paid in full. He \nincluded an undated letter with no letterhead, which appears to be from the collection \nagent representing the creditor, which states: \u201cDue to extenuating circumstances, a \nrequest is being sent to delete the report(s) issued by our office to Credit Reporting \nAgencies (CRAs). Although at this time we are requesting a deletion, please understand \nout client(s) owns the account(s).\u201d The letter lists the current balance of the debt as zero. \n(AE-A.) The fact the letter is undated and is not on official letterhead identifying who \nissued it raises questions about its timing and validity. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: past-due account placed for collection in the amount of $353. The \nJuly 2022 credit report shows the debt as delinquent and assigned to collection in March \n2022. (Item 5 at 2-3.) Applicant asserts this account is paid and that proof of payments is \nincluded with his Answer. The Government noted his assertion and stated he failed to \nsubmit documentary evidence to support that the account had been settled. After the \nGovernment asserted he had not submitted the documentary evidence he did not \nchallenge the Government\u2019s statement or submit the documentary evidence in his \nResponse. The documentary evidence he provided in his Response addressed a different \ndebt alleged on the SOR. \nApplicant provides no further explanation and provides no further substantiating \ndocumentation showing any action he had taken to resolve or address his accounts. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThis case involves an Applicant\u2019s inability to pay debts. His admissions and the \ndocumentary evidence in the FORM establish the following disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties developed in 2016 \nwhile he was student. He did not have the financial resources to support the financial \nchoices he made, and he failed to pay his debts. Even if I were to find that \u00b6 20(b) partially \napplies, in that he incurred his debts while he was a student earning a minimal income \nthrough his part-time jobs, he did not provide substantiating documentation with his \nAnswer demonstrating that he has taken any action to resolve or address SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.c, or 1.d, or that he acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve his financial \nobligations on these debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established, as Applicant initiated repayment plan on one \ndebt, SOR \u00b6 1.b. Although AE-A appears to indicate that he disputed SOR \u00b6 1.c, the letter \nis undated and is not on official letterhead, which raises questions about its validity. He \nfailed to provide evidence that the other debts were paid, otherwise being resolved, or \ndisputed.

Sep.26, 2019). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer, Applicant denied all the SOR allegations. She claimed that she did not recognize the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l. She claimed that the debt amounts are incorrect in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g. Her assertions regarding these debts are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 55 years old. She was married in 1995 and has three adult children. She has worked as an advanced distributed learning specialist since 2020. She has been consistently employed since 2008. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1990, master\u2019s degree in 2007, and a doctorate in 2020. She served on active duty in the Army from 1991-1997 and received an honorable discharge. She has held a security clearance since about 2017. (Item 2) Applicant reported that her financial troubles started in 2020 when her husband lost his job due to the COVID-19 pandemic and claims that he was unable to find work until mid-2022. She did not provide information about how much monthly income they lost as a result of his unemployment. She also reported that in 2021 she had to move after being given 30 days notice, because her landlord sold the home that they rented.

She claimed that she did \nnot recognize the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l. She claimed that \nthe debt amounts are incorrect in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g. Her assertions \nregarding these debts are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old. She was married in 1995 and has three adult children. \nShe has worked as an advanced distributed learning specialist since 2020. She has been \nconsistently employed since 2008. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1990, master\u2019s \ndegree in 2007, and a doctorate in 2020. She served on active duty in the Army from \n1991-1997 and received an honorable discharge. She has held a security clearance since \nabout 2017. (Item 2) \nApplicant reported that her financial troubles started in 2020 when her husband \nlost his job due to the COVID-19 pandemic and claims that he was unable to find work \nuntil mid-2022. She did not provide information about how much monthly income they lost \nas a result of his unemployment. She also reported that in 2021 she had to move after \nbeing given 30 days notice, because her landlord sold the home that they rented. This \namount of time is standard when a month-to-month rental agreement is terminated. In \nearly 2022, she purchased land from a family member and paid their back taxes on the \nland, so they had a place to live. She did not provide any documentation showing the \namount of the purchase or the taxes paid, or state how she was able to do this while her \nhusband was out of work. (Answer) \nApplicant stated that her poor credit was brought to her attention in 2022, and she \nstarted working with a credit repair agency after receiving the SOR. The agency was \nsupposed to assist her with debt verification and removing items from her credit report. \nShe provided documentation from the credit repair agency that several negative accounts \nwere removed from her credit report. However, this documentation did not state what \naccounts were removed from her credit report or why they were removed. She did not \nprovide sufficient documentation showing that any of the accounts alleged in the SOR \nwere removed from her credit report. (Answer; Response; AE A-C) \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling about $32,000. The status of the \ndebts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an auto loan that has been charged off for $23,167. She reported that \nshe voluntarily returned her car, because they could not afford two vehicles after her \nhusband lost his job. She stated that the creditor was supposed to sell the car and she \nwould be responsible for the difference. She claimed that the amount charged off was the \nbalance when she returned the vehicle, but has not been given the sale price or the \nremainder owed, and she has not taken any action on the debt. The loan was charged off \nin 2021.

(Answer; Response). \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19.

AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence showing \nthat any of the SOR debts are resolved or being paid, or that they became delinquent \nunder circumstances that are unlikely to recur. She also failed to provide sufficient \ndocumentation of her current financial situation, evidence which might establish her ability \nto address her debts responsibly. Her failure to pay her delinquent debt is recent, ongoing, \nand not isolated. Her failure to meet her financial obligations continues to cast doubt on \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. While her husband\u2019s unemployment was beyond her \ncontrol, she failed to provide sufficient evidence that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) could potentially apply, because Applicant provided documentation that \nshe was working with a credit repair agency. However, she did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation of payment arrangements, payments made, or resolution of any of the \nSOR debts.

AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered her military service. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of her delinquent debts \nunder Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

She has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Ceramic Art. She is \nemployed by a defense contractor as a Research Project Manager. She is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant has an extensive history of illegal drug use beginning in high school, \ninvolving marijuana, hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybin), ecstasy, and cocaine. \nApplicant has worked in the defense industry since 2010. She was hired by her current \nemployer in November 2017, as an Engineer, Level 1, and has moved up quickly to her \ncurrent position. She is applying for a security clearance for the first time. \nApplicant began using marijuana in high school in October 2003 with varying \nfrequency. Her use of marijuana continued through college and afterwards until about \n2014. For the most part, from 2014 to 2017, Applicant stopped using all illegal drugs, \nincluding marijuana. From 2017 to January 2021, she made new friends and started \nusing marijuana again, about once a month. She explained that she would occasionally \nhit someone\u2019s vape pen during a social event or if it were offered to her. (Tr. pp. 41-42.) \nShe ate edibles twice, but found them to be too strong. She enjoyed marijuana as it \nhelped her relax and helped her sleep. (Tr. p. 23.) Applicant has not used marijuana \nsince about January 2021. \nApplicant began using ecstasy in May 2004 while in high school. That summer \nshe used it twice a month with her friends until about mid-August 2004. She did use \necstasy again until 2008, and continued to use it with varying frequency until about \nOctober 2020.  (Tr. p. 29.) \nApplicant used cocaine one time in high school in May 2004.  She did not use it \nagain until about 2018/2019.  She stated that she used it about 15 times between 2018 \nand 2020/2021.  (Tr. p. 23.)  She did not particularly like it, and so she did not use it \nagain until recently.  She stated that she used it only on the weekends when she knew it \nwould not impact her job.  (Tr. p. 25.)  She has a friend that she would use cocaine with, \nand when her friend moved, she made a conscious decision to stop using cocaine.  (Tr. \np. 26.)  Applicant last used cocaine in January 2021. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has used psilocybin mushrooms a total of about eight times, three \ntimes from May 2004 to 2010; and five times between 2015 to May 2022. (Tr. p. 33.) \nShe has also used LSD on three occasions, twice in college, and once in May 2020. \n(Tr. p. 33-34.) She does not want to use mushrooms again because they take her out \nof control. Applicant stated that she normally did not have to pay for her illegal drugs. \nOften her friends would provide them for her. (Tr. pp. 31-32.) \nDuring her interview with OPM, Applicant indicated that she could potentially use \nmushrooms in the future. She stated that her opinions on the matter have changed. \nShe stated that her two years of sobriety have made her feel the most balanced and \nclear that she has felt for some time. She enjoys this lifestyle. Her priorities have \nchanged. She stated that she is now more focused on her career and building a future \nfor herself. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nFrom about 2014 to 2017 Applicant tapered off her marijuana use and was not \nusing illegal drugs of any sort. (Tr. p. 34.) She explained that when she moved from \nState A to State B at the end of 2017, she was alone and had no friends. She made \nnew friends and slowly accumulated people close to her who used illegal drugs. \nApplicant stated that she was never addicted to any hard drugs. She is now \ntrying to live a cleaner lifestyle. She stated that she is in a place of sobriety from illegal \nsubstances, accomplishing this on her own, and has even stopped smoking cigarettes. \nShe has friends who casually participate in these substances, but their use does not \nimpact her decisions. \nHer motivation for curtailing her illegal drug use was not \nprompted by her desire for a security clearance. She stated that she did not like the \nrecovery process which took several days after using drugs, and she did not feel good \nduring that time. (Tr. p. 38.) She also currently has a boyfriend who she has been \ndating since May 2022. He has a Top Secret clearance. They spend lots of time \ntogether and they do not do drugs.  (Tr. p. 43.) \nA letter from Applicant\u2019s best friend, who has known her for at least ten years, \nattests to her good character, hard-working nature, and commitment to values. She \nrecognizes Applicant as an honest, intelligent, reliable, trustworthy individual. \nShe \nknows that Applicant has partaken in illegal substances, but no longer feels that these \nexperiences serve her and her growth, and has made the commitment to a drug-free \nlifestyle. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s history shows a lifestyle of illegal drug use including marijuana, \nhallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybin), ecstasy, and cocaine from October 2003 \nthrough January 2021. She used illegal drugs while in a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has used a variety of illegal drugs from about 2004 to about 2021. \nThese drugs include marijuana, hallucinogenic mushrooms, ecstasy, cocaine and LSD. \nSome are very dangerous mind-altering drugs. Applicant used marijuana the most \nfrequently. She has used illegal drugs while working in the defense industry before \nbeing hired by her current employer. She continued to use marijuana after being hired \nby her current employer in 2017, a defense contractor, and while holding a sensitive \nposition in total disregard of DoD policies and Federal law. Applicant is expected to \nshow a high level of maturity, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nIn this case, \nApplicant has fallen short of meeting these eligibility requirements. \nIn fact, given \nApplicant\u2019s extensive illegal drug involvement, she does not meet the requirements for \neligibility to access classified information. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. \nVery concerning is the fact that the \nApplicant is a 35-year-old college graduate who made the conscious choice to use a \nvariety of illegal drugs over a period of many years while working in the defense \nindustry. \nShe has ignored Federal law. \nUnder the particular facts of this case, \nApplicant does not show the requisite character of someone who has the maturity, \nintegrity, good judgment, and reliability necessary to access classified information. At \nthis time, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for access to classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security clearance \nis expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has not demonstrated the level \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof maturity needed for access to classified information.

Applicant is not eligible \nfor access to classified information, and does not meet the qualifications for a security \nclearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Since April 2020 he has worked for two federal contractors as an engineer. He enlisted in the U.S. Army from 2003 to 2007 and then the Army Reserve from 2007 to 2011. Applicant deployed to a war zone in about 2004 for one year and served in a dangerous part of that country as a part of the Army\u2019s communications operations. He was honorably discharged from both the Army and the Army Reserve. He has been diagnosed with combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and has a 30 percent disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). He was granted a secret clearance in 2010 in connection with his military service. His security clearance status in 2005 and before is discussed below under SOR \u00b6 1.d. He applied for a security clearance in April 2020 (2020 SCA), and he submitted a second application, the e-QIP, in March 2022. (Tr. at 14-18; GE 1 at 5, 8-9, 17-21, 28-29, 35-36; AE G.)

The \ncase was assigned to me on April 25, 2023. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June \n12, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 12, 2023. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which I admitted without objection. (Hearing \nTranscript at 9-10.) \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough R. Department Counsel objected to AE Q on the ground that an opinion set forth \ntherein addressing the ultimate issue in this case, i.e., Applicant\u2019s suitability to be granted \na security clearance. I overruled the objection, stated that I would give the entire exhibit \nthe weight it deserved, and admitted Applicant\u2019s other exhibits without objection. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel requested that I leave the record open so that he could submit \nadditional exhibits after the hearing, I granted his request.

The record closed on August 18, 2023. \n(Tr. at 10-13.) \nProcedural Ruling \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR adding a \nsubparagraph 1.d to conform to the evidence developed at the hearing. Immediately \nfollowing the close of the hearing, he provided an email containing the specific wording \nof his amendment, which is the following: \n1.d. In about 2005, while granted access to classified information you used \nMarijuana. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel provided an email stating that he had no objection to the amendment \nas stated. At the time of Department Counsel\u2019s oral motion during the hearing, I raised \nthe issue with Applicant\u2019s counsel as to whether he needed additional time to prepare a \nresponse to the proposed amendment. He replied that he did not object to the amendment \nand did not need additional time to respond to the new allegation because it was closely \nassociated with the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c. I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to \namend, subject to reviewing the final version of the amendment language, as set forth \nabove. Upon review of the proposed amendment, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion \non July 13, 2023, without objection.

He was granted a secret clearance in 2010 in connection with his military \nservice. His security clearance status in 2005 and before is discussed below under SOR \n\u00b6 1.d. He applied for a security clearance in April 2020 (2020 SCA), and he submitted a \nsecond application, the e-QIP, in March 2022.

In the Answer, he \nadmitted all the allegations under this paragraph of the original SOR with explanations. \nApplicant wrote that in 2012 a physician gave him a card to permit him to purchase and \nuse medical marijuana under the laws of his state of residence (State 1) to help him with \nhis PTSD symptoms. He used marijuana a couple of times per week to relieve his anxiety \nand to help him sleep. He claimed that he stopped using marijuana in 2015 when his \nPTSD symptoms eased. Applicant\u2019s wife also received a physician\u2019s card permitting her \nto purchase and use medical marijuana to help her deal with her own medical issue of \ninsomnia.

During the dates \nalleged in the SOR, Applicant purchased medical marijuana in State 1 through \ndispensaries. He never purchased marijuana illegally under the laws of State 1. He \npurchased the marijuana for himself and his wife because he received a discount as a \nveteran. He testified that he purchased medical marijuana for his own use until June 2015, \nwhen he claimed that he stopped using marijuana. He continued purchasing marijuana \nfor his wife after June 2015 so that the purchases were less expensive with his discount. \nHis wife stopped using marijuana in July 2022, and Applicant stopped purchasing \nmarijuana at that time.

In this instance, I find that Applicant\u2019s last use of \nmarijuana was in about June 2015, as he testified. The critical difference with respect to \nthis issue is that Applicant provided collaborating evidence in the form of his wife\u2019s \nnotarized statement. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. Article 15, UCMJ, Wrongful Use and Possession of Marijuana in 2005. \nApplicant failed a drug test conducted on February 22, 2005, while serving in the U.S. \nArmy and deployed to a European country. He claimed that he used marijuana once in \nDecember 2004 during his leave at Christmas 2004. He received non-judicial punishment \n(NJP). The SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, that his punishment for using marijuana \nwas a reduction in grade from E-3 to E-1, forfeiture of pay, and the imposition of extra \nduty. Certain documents in the record incorrectly refer to the drug used by Applicant as \nMDMA (ecstasy) rather than marijuana. Applicant made the same mistake during his \nbackground interviews because he did not understand that MDMA and marijuana were \ntwo different, unrelated drugs. He testified that the only drug he has ever used was \nmarijuana. The FBI report in the record also incorrectly refers to MDMA rather than \nmarijuana. The Army records regarding the drug test, the NJP, and the investigative \nreport in the record all refer to Applicant\u2019s positive test for marijuana and his punishment \nfor using marijuana. I find that all references in the record to MDMA are erroneous and \nshould have referred to marijuana. (Tr. at 28-29, 64; GE 3 at 5-7, 15-16; GE 4 at 1-4; GE \n5 at 1-2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. Use of Marijuana in 2005 while Granted Access to Classified \nInformation. Prior to the 2005 incident in which Applicant was charged as alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c, above, Applicant had been granted access to classified information. Applicant \nacknowledged at the hearing that prior to 2005 he had prepared a security clearance \napplication. He testified he was unaware whether he had actually been granted a \nclearance. During cross examination, he acknowledged that during his deployment to a \nwar zone in 2004, he was responsible for using classified communication equipment, \nwhich required a security clearance (and access to classified information, in this case, the \nclassified equipment). Applicant\u2019s admissions are sufficient to establish by substantial \nevidence the fact that he held a security clearance and had access to classified \ninformation during his deployment. There was no evidence in the record that his clearance \nwas ever revoked upon his return on home leave to the United States or thereafter on his \ndeployment to a European country.

In the Answer, Applicant admitted the two \nallegations in this paragraph with explanations. \nSOR \u00b6 \u00b6 2.a and 2.b.

Section 23 of the e-QIP asks whether Applicant has used or\npurchased any illegal drugs in the past seven years. He answered both questions in the\nnegative, when in fact he had used and purchased marijuana within seven years of the\ne-QIP, which he signed and certified as \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d on March 31, 2022.\nHe testified that his last use of marijuana was in June 2015, which was less than seven\nyears prior to the e-QIP certification date. He also admitted that he continued to purchase\nmarijuana for his wife until July 2022, when she last used medical marijuana. (Tr. at 19-\n27; GE 1 at 33-34.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant claimed in his Answer that he mistakenly answered the e-QIP question \nby failing to disclose that he used marijuana in 2015. He wrote that he was uncertain \nwhether his last use of marijuana was within the seven years prior to the date of the e-\nQIP. Applicant also claimed in his August 2022 background interview that he had not \nused marijuana since December 2004 when he was in the Army, as discussed above \nunder SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. In a follow-up interview on August 3, 2022, Applicant again \ndenied that he had used marijuana since 2004. He insisted that all of his marijuana \npurchases were solely for his wife\u2019s medical use. He denied having PTSD. I note that the \nVA awarded Applicant a 30% disability award in a letter dated January 10, 2022, about \nseven months prior to the follow-up interview. As a result of his false statements in his \ninterview, DOHA in its interrogatories did not ask him when he last used marijuana. The \nonly question asked was simply whether he had used marijuana since August 2022. (GE \n1 at 33-34, 59; GE 2 at 14; GE 3 at 5, 12, 16; AE C; AE D at 1.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that \u201cin [his] head\u201d his last use of marijuana was \nbefore the seven-year reporting period, which began on March 31, 2015. This was \ninconsistent with his admission at the hearing that his last use was in about June 2015. \nIn weighing Applicant\u2019s credibility on the factual issue of why he omitted his marijuana \nuse in 2015 from the e-QIP, I have considered his success in earning a Bachelor of \nScience degree in Networking and Communications Management and working in \nresponsible positions as an engineer for two U.S. Government contractors. Also, I have \nweighed his demeanor at the hearing and his lack of credibility on several factual issues, \nas discussed above and as set forth below.

Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant deliberately omitted material \ninformation about his use of marijuana from the e-QIP. (Tr. at 30; GE 2 at 14; AE S; AE \nT.) \nApplicant admitted purchasing marijuana for his wife from 2012 to 2022, yet he \nalso failed to disclose these actions in the e-QIP. He testified that his incorrect answer \nwas due to being \u201cmixed up\u201d about what this question and the prior question about drug \nuse meant. He admitted at the hearing that he should have answered this question in the \naffirmative. I note again that Applicant\u2019s education and important work experience raise \nserious questions about the credibility of his claim of being confused by the simple \nlanguage in the e-QIP, as does his demeanor at the hearing. He alternatively explained \nin his background interview that he did not list his purchases of marijuana because his \npurchases were legal under the laws of State 1 and the e-QIP question asks whether he \nhas \u201cbeen involved in the illegal purchase . . . of any drug?\u201d Applicant\u2019s inconsistent \nexcuses for his patently incorrect answer to the e-QIP question further undercuts his \ncredibility about his e-QIP omission. I conclude that Applicant intentionally failed to \ndisclose that he had purchased marijuana during the seven-year period covered by the \nquestion. (Tr. at 31; GE 3 at 16; AE L.) \nDuring the security clearance background investigation, Applicant did not \nvoluntarily admit his positive drug test and NJP in 2005. The investigator had to confront \nhim about the 2004-2005 incidents. Also, he has offered two inconsistent versions of the \nevents surrounding his marijuana use in late 2004 after his return from deployment. In his \nbackground interview, he reported that he attended a Christmas party with high school \nfriends who were smoking marijuana, which he mistakenly referred to as MDMA, not \nknowing the difference between the two drugs. He stated that he was offered marijuana \nby a friend and smoked it. At the hearing, he testified that he did not know that the \ncigarette that he was given was really marijuana. He presented to a psychologist who \nprepared a report for this case the same story about his accidental use of marijuana and \ntold the psychologist that he \u201cimmediately discontinued using\u201d what he thought was an \nordinary cigarette. These inconsistencies further undermine Applicant\u2019s credibility. (Tr. at \n28, 46-49, 55-58; GE 3 at 9, 11; AE Q at 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s credibility is also strained by his contention in his background interview \nthat the only time he used marijuana (intentionally or accidentally) in the 2004 and 2005 \ntimeframe was at the December 2004 Christmas party while on home leave in State 1 for \ntwo weeks. He failed to mention his use of marijuana during the 2012 to 2015 period. \nWith respect to his 2004 use of marijuana, he advised the investigator that he returned to \nhis overseas deployment location in Europe shortly thereafter. He testified that he was \ndrug tested \u201cas soon as we got back from the two-week break.\u201d He tested positive for \nmarijuana. According to the Army\u2019s records, the drug test was actually administered on \nFebruary 22, 2005, about two months later. In the Army investigative records, Applicant \nis reported to have advised the investigators that he consumed marijuana on February \n13, 2005, while in State 1. In fact, his leave had ended several weeks before that date. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese inconsistencies are significant. Although there is no evidence in the record \nregarding the time period for the drug to produce a positive drug test after consumption, \nit strains credibility that Applicant\u2019s one-time use of marijuana in late December 2004 \nwould produce a positive test result for THC in late February 2005. The SOR does not \nallege this inconsistency regarding the date of Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana prior to his \ndrug test. However, the inconsistency raises an issue regarding Applicant\u2019s general \ncandor and credibility. (Tr. at 28-29, 62; GE 3 at 9,11; GE 4 at 3-4.) \nMitigation and Whole-Person Evidence \nApplicant provided extensive evidence in mitigation and in support of a favorable \nwhole-person assessment. I have carefully reviewed all of the evidence and note the \nfollowing specific items: Applicant provided a written statement of his intent to never use \nor possess an illegal drug in the future. He also provided his PTSD medical diagnosis and \nhis 30 percent VA disability rating. He provided his DD 214 evidencing his honorable \ndischarge from the Army. The DD 214 also listed the various medals and commendations \nhe was awarded during his military service, copies of which were also provided. (AE A; \nAE C; AE D; AE G; AE H.) \nIn addition, Applicant provided six character-reference letters and a notarized letter \nfrom his wife. The letters state that he works as an engineer providing valuable expertise \nwith data and computer systems. In October 2022 he was promoted to a lead position. \nTwo Army veterans who served with Applicant in a war zone praised his work ethic and \nloyalty to the United States. Applicant\u2019s wife described her husband as \u201ca dedicated family \nman\u201d and an \u201chonorable, dependable U.S citizen.\u201d (AE I; AE R; AE S.) \nApplicant also submitted a Summary of Psychological Evaluation prepared by a \nBoard-Certified Psychologist. The psychologist concluded that despite Applicant\u2019s history \nof PTSD and use of medical marijuana in the past, his \u201ccurrent judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness are not negatively affected or impaired from any psychological condition, \nsubstance use disorder, or underlying defect.\u201d (AE Q at 6.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and have carefully \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe record evidence established that Applicant used marijuana in 2004 or 2005 \nwhile granted access to classified information and that he tested positive in a drug test \nconducted on February 22, 2005. He also purchased and used marijuana again between \nJune 2012 and June 2015. Furthermore, he continued to purchase the drug from June \n2015 until July 2022 for use by his wife. All of the above potentially disqualifying conditions \napply. This shifts the burden of persuasion to Applicant to establish mitigation. \nThe mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have been considered and the following \npotentially apply to the facts in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Guidance.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana (including State 1) and sought to \u201cprovide \nclarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding the \nimportance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by \nholders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal marijuana \npolicy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] \nnot determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines provided various \nopportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns raised by his or her \npast use of marijuana. See AE E. \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana in 2015 happened several years ago and \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. His past use does not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The fact that he \nreceived NJP punishment in 2005 for his use or that he used marijuana after having been \ngranted access to classified equipment or sensitive information in 2004 or before does \nnot change this analysis. Since 2015 he has remained drug-free and has expressed his \nintention to continue to remain drug-free. AG \u00b6 26(a) is established with respect to \nApplicant\u2019s past use of marijuana. \nThe same analysis applies to Applicant\u2019s past purchases of marijuana for his \npersonal use. With respect to his purchases of marijuana for his wife as recently as July \n2022, I conclude that this behavior was recent, frequent, and did not happen under any \nunusual circumstances. He attempted to rationalize his purchases of marijuana for his \nwife by arguing that he was seeking to reduce the cost of the drug with his military \ndiscount. His actions cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 \n26(a) is not established with respect to Applicant\u2019s past purchases of marijuana. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b) and 26(b)(3) have been established with respect to Applicant\u2019s past \nuse of marijuana. Applicant has acknowledged his drug-involvement and has provided \nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem. Most significantly, he has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence since about June 2015. In addition, he has provided \na written statement expressing his intention to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse of illegal \ndrugs is grounds for revocation of his national security eligibility, if granted. \nOverall, Applicant has met his burden to establish mitigation of the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline H with respect to his past uses of marijuana and his \npurchases of marijuana for his use. However, Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his purchases of marijuana over a ten-year period for his wife\u2019s use. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 \u2013 (Guideline E, Personal Contact)  \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following condition that may raise security concerns and \npotentially be disqualifying in this case. \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant omitted from the e-QIP his use of marijuana within the preceding seven \nyears, i.e., since March 31, 2015. He has acknowledged that his last use of marijuana \nwas at least in June 2015. Based on Applicant\u2019s demeanor and the various discrepancies \nin the record between statements he has made in writing or orally to an investigator or at \nthe hearing in this case, I conclude that Applicant deliberately falsified his response in the \ne-QIP when he wrote that he had not used marijuana in the prior seven years. I also find \nthat his excuse for not disclosing his purchases of marijuana for his wife since 2015 and \nmost recently in July 2022 was a deliberate falsification. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 16(a) is \nestablished. This shifts the burden of persuasion to Applicant to establish mitigation.  \nThe mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 have been considered and the following \npotentially apply to the facts in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith effort to correct the omission, \nconcealment or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the omission in the e-\nQIP regarding his marijuana use in the past seven years. In fact, he denied that he had \nused marijuana since 2004 in his 2022 background interview. He did advise the \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvestigator that he had purchased marijuana for his wife since June 2012. This disclosure \npartially establishes AG \u00b6 17(a) with respect to the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2(b). However, \nApplicant did not acknowledge that he had purchased marijuana for his own use within \nthe relevant seven-year time period, which significantly undercuts the mitigation value of \nhis partial disclosure. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) has not been established. Applicant\u2019s falsifications are not minor, and \nthey are recent. The falsifications are directly related to the security concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s drug use after 2012 and his purchases of marijuana for both his use and his \nwife\u2019s use. The falsifications cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Overall, Applicant has not met his burden to establish mitigation of the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline E. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have given significant weight \nto Applicant\u2019s years of service in the Army and the Army Reserve, which included a one-\nyear deployment to a war zone. Applicant suffered from PTSD as a result of his \nexperiences while deployed. He also provided substantial evidence regarding his \ncharacter and his educational and employment successes. He has provided sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline H regarding his past \npurchases and use of marijuana, including his NJP, and use after being granted access \nto classified information. However, his evidence falls far short of that required to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised by his lack of candor in the preparation of his e-QIP. Other \ninconsistencies in the record, while not alleged in the SOR, can properly be considered \nin this whole-person analysis, and they weigh against Applicant with respect to his \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhonesty, candor, reliability, and judgment. Overall, the record evidence raises questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial consideration concerns.

(GEs 1-8) \nApplicant relied on one witness (herself) and ten exhibits. (AEs A-J). The transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on September 28, 2023. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with updates on her payments to \nher creditors and the status of her student loans with the Department of Education \n(DoE). For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the \nrecord. Department Counsel was afforded one day to respond. \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with a documented \npayoff of one SOR creditor, a summary of creditors she has contacted post-hearing, \nendorsements from her supervisor and co-worker, a post-hearing letter submission, and \npayment arrangements she has made with her DoE student loan creditor. Applicant\u2019s \nsubmissions were admitted without objections as AEs K-P. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated 16 delinquent \nfederally guaranteed student loans exceeding $160,000, along with 12 consumer debts \nexceeding $15,000 and medical debts exceeding $4,500. Allegedly. her delinquent \naccounts have not been resolved and remain outstanding. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of her student loan debts\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 1.g-1-p 1.s-1.t). with explanations. She denied the allegations covering \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1-r, 1.v-1.x, 1.aa-1.bb, and 1.dd-1.hh with explanations. Applicant further \nclaimed major medical issues associated with her mother, grandmother, and stepfather, \nall of which negatively impacted her finances.  \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(GE 1; Tr. 44) She reported recurrent unemployment between February 2013 \nand August 2018. She held a security clearance during her first Army National Guard \nenlistment. (GE 1) However, her clearance was revoked by the Army in 2012 due to \nsecurity concerns over her finances attributable to unstable employment issues. (GE 2; \nTr. 48) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2002 and 2014, Applicant took out federal student loans to finance her \nundergraduate education. (GEs 1-8) All of the loans were individual loans without any \nco-signors. (GEs 4-8) Due to recurrent problems in finding employment, she \nencountered difficulties in paying her delinquent student loans and other debts. (Tr. 49) \nCredit reports document that her student accounts remained in collection status before \n2023. (GEs 4-6). She filed applications for forbearance over the course of her loans to \nlighten the interest accruals on the loans and received some forbearance relief between \n2011 and 2013. (Tr. 60-62) Since her student loans became delinquent in 2018, she \nhas not received any confirmations of additional forbearance relief. (GE 7; Tr. 60) \nIn April 2023, Applicant applied for and was accepted in the DoE\u2019s fresh start \nprogram. (AEs G-H and J; Tr. 60) Payments on her newly consolidated student loans \n(consolidated as a part of her fresh start acceptance) are scheduled to commence in \nMarch 2024. (AE P; Tr.40-42, 61, 63-64) Payment terms call for monthly payments on \nthe balance of her loans of $1,744. (AE P). She hopes to be able to fit her student loan \nrepayment obligations into her budget that also includes monthly financial support to her \nfamily and friends. (Tr. 60-62) \nApplicant has been making $200 monthly payments on her student loans in the \ninterim before her fresh start loan payment obligations vest in 2024. (Tr. 64-65) Whether \nshe will have sufficient resources to follow through with her much more substantial \nconsolidated loan payments scheduled to commence in March 2024 is unclear and \ncannot be reliably anticipated at this time without a more positive track record. \nBesides her student loans, Applicant accumulated 12 delinquent consumer debts \nexceeding $15,000 and four medical debts exceeding $4,500. (GEs 4-8) She has made \nonly limited contacts with her creditors since her accounts were opened. And, she has \nmade only a few scattered payments on these accounts. (AEs C-K; Tr. 68-74) \nRecently, Applicant entered into payment plans with SOR creditors 1.q (a $1,515 \nconsumer account) and 1.z (a $252 consumer account), but provided no material \npayment progress on these plans. (AEs F and C; Tr. 68-75) She is credited with paying \noff two accounts: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y (for $389) and 1.bb (for $479).

In her post-hearing submissions, she documented a payoff \n(undated) of this loan in 2014. (AEs K-L) Whether Applicant paid off this loan or the loan \nwas assigned to another creditor is unclear. Her most recent credit report of September \n2023 only verified the opening of the loan account in 2010 for $16,210 and her \nrefinancing of the loan in 2014. (GE 8) Nothing more is known about the current status \nof this loan or how the previously reported charge off of the loan has been resolved. \n(GEs 3-4) Without documented payments from Applicant of the reported $8,632 balance \nor other clarifying information from Applicant, her SOR \u00b6 1.f debt cannot be favorably \nresolved. \nApplicant continues to dispute several debts. These disputed debts are reported \nas delinquent accounts covered as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.v (for $1,022), 1.w (for $699) and \n1.x (for $392). She cited her return of the equipment she purchased and returned to the \ncreditors as the basis of her disputes with them. Efforts to have these debts removed \nfrom her credit reports have not been successful.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n Financial Considerations \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \n  Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s reported accumulation of 12 \ndelinquent DoE student loans (exceeding $160,000) between 2002 and 2014 to finance \nher undergraduate education. Additional concerns about her finances relate to the \ndelinquent consumer and medical debts that for the most part have not been resolved. \nThese debt delinquencies warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions \n(DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; \nand 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant cited reliance on her insufficient resources to cover the financial \nassistance she provides friends and family members and still satisfy her own \naccumulated student loans and other debts. To date, she has managed to make a few \nscattered payments on several consumer accounts, establish payment plans with a few \nof her creditors, and pay off two small accounts. By far, her largest debt delinquencies \nare covered by her 12 delinquent student loan accounts that have since been \nconsolidated under Applicant\u2019s DoE administered fresh start program. Calculated \nmonthly payments of $1,744 on her consolidated loans become due in March 2024 and \nare expected to be challenging for her on her current budget. \nPartially applicable mitigating conditions (MC) include MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency \na death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or \nidentity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d; 20(d), \u201cthe \nindividual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debt\u2019; and 20(c), \u201cthe individual has received or is receiving financial \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n   \n \ncounseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncred counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control.\u201d \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). \nWell-intentioned promises, while encouraging, cannot be substituted for a \nvoluntary, good faith track record of payments. Based on the evidence presented, \nApplicant is not able to demonstrate a sufficient tangible payment history of actual debt \nreduction to satisfy Appeal Board guidance associated with the good-faith and \nresponsible payment requirements of MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and MC 20(d). And, with only brief \nundetailed counseling sessions with her financial counselor, very limited credit can be \nassigned to her counseling initiatives. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Applicant\u2019s problems in managing her finances have been \nlongstanding and slow to abate. Taking into account her credited defense contributions, \nher extenuating circumstances associated with her recurrent periods of unemployment \nand split financial responsibilities with her friends and family members, she has shown \nsome encouraging progress in addressing her debts and regaining control of her \nfinances. \nWith over $160,000 owed on her student loans and heavy payment \nresponsibilities facing her in early 2024, her repayment initiatives promise, however, to \nbe tested with still uncertain payment outcomes. Without a better track record of good-\nfaith, responsible payment initiatives pre-dating the issuance of the SOR, her efforts to \ndate fall short of the level of financial responsibility required to demonstrate responsible \nregain control of her finances. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

On multiple \naccounts he said, \u201cI attempted to work out a payment plan with them but could not come \nto an agreement and/or could not keep up with it. Or I just forgot about paying them off \nwhen I did have the money while the account was still open.\u201d (GE 1) The SOR alleges \nthe following financial concerns: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the \nBankruptcy Code in about November 2004, and his debts were discharged in about June \n2006. Applicant said he filed for bankruptcy because he was unemployed. (Tr. 23-24) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the \nBankruptcy Code in about January 2008, and his bankruptcy was dismissed in about \nDecember 2009. He was unsure about why he filed for bankruptcy. (Tr. 23) It may have \nbeen because of employment issues for himself or his spouse and to ensure he was able \nto retain his home. (Tr. 23-25) He obtained a mortgage modification, and he was able to \nretain his home. (Tr. 25) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the \nBankruptcy Code in about May 2015, and his bankruptcy was dismissed in about \nFebruary 2016. (GE 1 at 38) Applicant filed the Chapter 13 to enable him to receive a \nmortgage modification, and then once the mortgage modification was approved, he had \nthe bankruptcy dismissed. (Tr. 25) His mortgage arrearage was about $73,000. (GE 1 at \n38) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant has a delinquent tax debt owed to the Federal \nGovernment of about $15,000. (GE 1 at 40) Applicant said his tax debt originated in 2009; \nhe was making or had made some monthly payments; he was unsure of the amount \nowed; and the IRS withheld some funds. (Tr. 28-29) As of the date of his hearing, he had \nnot filed his federal or state income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2021 or 2022. (Tr. 30) \nHe thought his spouse had filed their tax returns. (Tr. 33) He indicated in his November \n11, 2021 SCA that he had a payment plan in the past with the IRS; however, he did not \nhave a current payment plan. (GE 1 at 40) \nOn May 25, 2023, Applicant filed his TY 2021 federal and state income tax returns. \n(AE A) All figures on tax returns are rounded to nearest $1,000. For TY 2021, his adjusted \ngross income (AGI) was $277,000; his taxable income was $218,000; and his taxes owed \nwere $24,000. (Id.) He owed $9,000 in state income taxes for TY 2021. (Id.) \nOn May 25, 2023, Applicant filed his TY 2022 federal and state income tax returns. \n(AE B) For TY 2022, he had a nonpassive loss of $362,000 on his business. His AGI on \nhis TY 2022 federal income tax return is negative $53,000; his taxable income is zero; \nand his taxes show a $21,000 refund. (Id.)

(AE D) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d  \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He and his spouse were \nunemployed or underemployed. His spouse was in a serious accident. For TY 2022, he \nhad a nonpassive loss of $362,000 on his business. These circumstances were beyond \ntheir control and adversely affected his finances. For example, for his nonpassive loss, \nhe did not describe the source of these funds, whether additional debt resulted, and the \ncause of the loss. He did not provide sufficient details to assess the magnitude of the \nadverse effect on his overall finances or whether these negative effects on his finances \nresulted in the delinquent debt detailed in the SOR. Moreover, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or \nher] control, the judge could still consider whether applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. \nNov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. \n99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).   \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the \nBankruptcy Code in about November 2004, and his debts were discharged in about June \n2006. Applicant said he filed for bankruptcy because he was unemployed.

I have \ncredited Applicant with mitigating the financial issues in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.q. \nApplicant disclosed many of his SOR debts on his SCA and during his OPM \ninterview. He did not provide a detailed plan about how he planned to address or resolve \nhis debts in his SCA, during his OPM interview, or at his hearing. \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(b) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. He did not \nprove that he maintained contact with the SOR creditors over the years or that he worked \ndiligently to timely pay his debts. \nThe SOR does not allege that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection \nthe week before his security clearance hearing. On May 25, 2023, Applicant filed his TY \n2021 federal and state income tax returns. For TY 2021, his AGI was $277,000; his \ntaxable income was $218,000; and his federal income taxes owed were $24,000. He \nowed $9,000 in state income taxes for TY 2021. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not \nalleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014)). The \nnon-SOR allegations will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \nMost of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts are charged off or eventually will not appear on his \ncredit report or both. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not \nmeaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, \n2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit \nReporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items from a credit report seven \nyears from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because \nof a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. Debts \nmay be dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not \ngoing to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request \nfor information, or when the debt has been charged off. \nExcluding his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing in 2004, which was based on \nunemployment, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of the \nBankruptcy Code in 2008, 2015, and 2023. He said the purpose for filing bankruptcy was \nto stop the foreclosure on his residence and encourage the mortgage lender to agree to \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na mortgage modification. He also said he had not made his mortgage payment for about \n30 months prior to his most recent Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing. He did not provide \nenough information about why he was unable to make his mortgage payments to \nestablish his good faith. Applicant has state and federal income tax debts. He has owed \ndelinquent taxes since about 2009. He may intend to pay his taxes at this point; however, \nthe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly \ncorrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated \nto prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of \n[a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal and state income tax \nreturns or to pay federal or state income taxes when due. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nApplicant received financial counseling with each of his bankruptcies, and he \nprovided a budget as part of the bankruptcy process. Applying the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence, he did not prove that he was unable to make greater progress sooner by \nestablishing payment plans with his SOR creditors, including federal and state income \ntax authorities. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old software developer.

His failure to take prudent responsible actions raise unmitigated \nquestions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nSee AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.f. He denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c and 1.e. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 38 years old. He was married and divorced twice. He has two children ages 10 and 7 years old from his second marriage. He remarried in 2019. He served in the military from 2003 to 2011 and was honorably discharged. He has been employed by his present employer since October 2022. Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in March 2022. In it he disclosed that he attended college from September 2011 through July 2015, and it appears he took a semester off during that time. He attended again from May 2018 to May 2020 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. He began taking classes in December 2021 working towards a master\u2019s degree. (Item 3) Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he was unemployed while attending college and used his savings, educational benefits from his military service, and his Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability payments to support himself. He disclosed that he owned a business and was self-employed from July 2016 through August 2018. He said he closed the business to pursue his education.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 13, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 15, 2023, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 2 through 7 (Item 1 is the SOR). Applicant submitted a \nresponse to the FORM and objected to Item 7, a summary of a personal subject interview, \nbecause it was unauthenticated. His objection is sustained, and Item 7 will not be \nconsidered. He had no other objections and Items 2 through 6 are admitted in evidence. \nHe provided documents that are marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D. There \nwere no objections, and they are admitted in evidence. The case was assigned to me on \nJuly 31, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.f. He denied the SOR \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c and 1.e. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old. He was married and divorced twice. He has two children \nages 10 and 7 years old from his second marriage. He remarried in 2019. He served in \nthe military from 2003 to 2011 and was honorably discharged. He has been employed by \nhis present employer since October 2022. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in March 2022. In it he \ndisclosed that he attended college from September 2011 through July 2015, and it \nappears he took a semester off during that time. He attended again from May 2018 to \nMay 2020 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. He began taking classes in December 2021 \nworking towards a master\u2019s degree. (Item 3) \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that he was unemployed while attending college \nand used his savings, educational benefits from his military service, and his Department \nof Veterans Affairs (VA) disability payments to support himself. He disclosed that he \nowned a business and was self-employed from July 2016 through August 2018. He said \nhe closed the business to pursue his education. (Item 3) \nApplicant disclosed two delinquent debts in his SCA. He disclosed a delinquent \ndebt for a credit card. He stated the amount owed was $5,500 and it was paid in full. He \nalso disclosed a second credit card debt that he said was to be paid by his ex-wife, but it \nremained on his credit report. It is not alleged in the SOR. (Item 3) \nApplicant responded to government interrogatories in September 2022. In them, \nhe was asked to provide information about the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a through 1.e. \nHe reported that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, which appears to be a small business loan that \nwas charged off in the amount of $43,741, was not paid. He indicated he had a payment \nplan and was making payments. The amount alleged in the SOR was $1,743, which was \na fee and not the balance owed. In the FORM, Applicant was advised of the accurate \ndelinquent balance of $43,741. It had not been paid. He explained that his was a joint \nloan with his second ex-wife and they were both supposed to pay $300 a month per a \ncourt agreement, until it was paid in full. He said she failed to pay her amount. He did not \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprovide documentation that he paid his amount or action he took from 2018 to 2023. The \noriginal loan was for $50,000. (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer he stated that he had paid $1,743 to the creditor in \u00b6 \n1.a and the debt was paid in full. This was only the fee owed which was in addition to the \n$43,741 balance owed on the original $50,000 small business loan. In his FORM \nresponse, he said this debt was charged off in 2018. He failed to pay it because he lost \nhis job, and he notified the creditor. He did not provide proof of his notification or \nsubsequent actions. He reported on his SCA that he was unemployed from September \n2018 to February 2021 because he was a student and convalescing from a medical issue. \nHe also disclosed that from July 2016 to August 2018, he and his second ex-wife were \nself-employed as owners of a fitness business that they closed down to pursue higher \neducation. Presumably the small business loan was used to open this business. He also \nsaid the pandemic impacted his employment and he became a full-time student to allow \nhim more job opportunities. He said he made payments after the debt was \u201cwritten off.\u201d \nHe did not provide proof of those payments. He stated once he became employed, he \nreached out to the creditor to make payment arrangements and his account showed only \na balance of $1,743, which he paid on February 7, 2023. He said he reached out again \nto obtain confirmation of the balance owed and the website was not providing accurate \ninformation. It appears there was an issue with the website, and it did not reflect the full \nbalance. He said he now has a payment plan to pay $400 a month on the balance. \nApplicant provided email correspondence with the creditor from February 2023 requesting \nclarification and confirmation about the balance owed. His next correspondence with the \ncreditor is in May 2023 where he indicates he made a payment. He did not provide proof \nof this payment. He provided a document dated June 6, 2023, whereby the creditor \nagrees to accept $400 a month to begin the same month until the balance is paid in full. \n(Item 4; AE A, B, C) \nApplicant reported in the interrogatories that the SOR \u00b6 1.b debt ($7,220 \u2013 credit \ncard) was not paid and he had not made payments or payment arrangements. He \nexplained he was not familiar with the account, believing it had to do with a car loan, which \nhe was current on. He provided documents to show his car loan is current, but it is not \nthe same debt. (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b stating this was a \nvehicle loan that was paid. It is listed on his April 2022 credit bureau report as an individual \ncredit card debt that was opened in December 2016 and charged off in approximately \nJanuary 2018. As part of his answer to the SOR, Applicant provided a credit report from \nFebruary 2023, which clearly lists the debt as a charged-off credit card. The account is \nreported as an individual account. In his FORM response, he did not provide any \ninformation about the status of this debt. It is unresolved. (Items 2, 4, 5) \nApplicant reported in his interrogatories that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($5,381) was \nnot paid, he had not made payments or payment arrangements. In his SOR answer, \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($5,381). Applicant stated he disputed the debt \non his credit report. His February 2023 credit report shows the dispute was resolved, and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant disagreed with the resolution. He claimed his accounts with the original creditor \nare current. His February 2023 credit report shows he has three accounts with the original \ncreditor. However, the account alleged, which was with the same creditor, is now owned \nby a third-party collector, and that collection account is reflected as unpaid and \ndelinquent. This debt is reported as an individual account. He did not provide additional \nevidence in his FORM response as to its status. It is unresolved. (Items 2, 4, 5) \nApplicant reported in his interrogatories that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($3,793 \u2013 car \nloan) was not paid but he had made payment arrangements and was making payments. \nHe explained he was unaware of the debt and contacted the creditor. At the time of his \ninterrogatory response, he was waiting for a response from the creditor. Applicant \nadmitted in his SOR answer that he owed the debt in \u00b6 1.d ($3,793) to a car company but \nsaid he had been unaware of it. In his SOR answer, he provided a copy of what appears \nto be a posting from a credit card showing a payment to the creditor on February 23, \n2023, for $350, and one on March 6, 2023, for $1,500. In his FORM response, he said he \nmade payments towards the debt and continues to do so. He said he had a remaining \nbalance of $600. He did not provide documents to corroborate any additional payments, \na payment agreement, or the current balance. (Item 2 page 38; Item 4; AE C) \nApplicant reported in his interrogatories that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($3,201) was \nnot paid and he did not know what the account was for. He was going to contact the \ncreditor. In his answer to the SOR, he denied the account. He said he contacted the \ncreditor and had not received a reply. He did not provide corroborating evidence of action \nto resolve or dispute the debt. It is unresolved. (Item 4) \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, a charged-off credit card account. He said \nin his SOR answer that the account was past due when he was deployed, and it was paid \nin full. He said he has an account with the creditor that is current and active, and he is \nunsure why it is listed as delinquent and unpaid. Applicant\u2019s February 2023 credit report \nshows three accounts with the same creditor. All three have different account numbers. \nTwo are current and one is charged off in the amount of $2,253 but shows the charged-\noff account was paid. This account is resolved. (Item 2) \nAs part of his response to interrogatories, Applicant provided a personal financial \nstatement. It reflects that he has two credit cards, a car loan (2022 vehicle), and a \nmortgage that are all current. He does not list any other payments to creditors. He shows \nhis remaining expendable income at the end of the month is $4,864, which includes his \nVA disability payment. His assets include a 2021 vehicle (paid), a four-wheel recreational \nvehicle, a canoe, and gym equipment (valued at $6,000). He has approximately $15,000 \nin savings. It is unknown if his wife is employed. He pays $600 a month in child support. \nIn his SOR answer, he said his personal financial statement remains the same, except \nhis VA disability payment has increased and his salary from his employer has increased \nslightly. (Item 2, Item 4 page 9) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant attributed his financial issues to when he was going \nthrough a divorce and deployments.

He said he is financially stable \nand pays his bills on time. He said his credit has improved since 2018, and he bought a \nhouse in 2022. He said he does not have delinquent accounts and has not been late in \npayments for several years. He claimed he was unaware of the alleged SOR debts until \nthey were brought to his attention during the security review process. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that were unpaid for years. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties.

He also suggested that his ex-wife might be responsible for some of the \ndebts. All of the debts alleged, except the small business loan, were individually held by \nApplicant. He and his ex-wife were equally responsible for the $50,000 loan they obtained \nin 2016 and defaulted on in 2018. He claimed he was unaware of his delinquent debts \nuntil the security clearance process started. It is not believable that he and his ex-wife \nobtained a $50,000 loan in 2016 and chose to shut down the business in 2018 so he \ncould resume his education, but he was unaware that he was still responsible to repay \nthe loan. He stated that both he and his wife were required to pay $300 a month until the \nloan was repaid. He did not provide documentary proof that he made his payments. He \ndid not provide evidence of actions he took to resolve the debt until he was confronted \nwith it when he received government interrogatories in September 2022. Admittedly, there \nwas confusion on the balance owed, but it is not believable that he thought he only owed \n$1,743. He failed to inquire about the actual balance until after his security investigation \nbegan. He paid the $1,742 in February 2023 and made payment arrangements on the \ndelinquent loan in June 2023. Although Applicant now has a plan in place, his failure to \ntake action, or to provide documentary evidence of previous action taken does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to repay this creditor. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s divorce, deployments, unemployment, and medical issues may have \nbeen beyond his control. However, Applicant was discharged from the military in 2011. \nThe debts alleged are not from that time. His unemployment was partly within his control \nas he chose to shut down his business in 2018 and pursue his education goals.

For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant must have acted responsibly. Applicant said he was unaware of his delinquent \ndebts. I have already addressed the small business loan. However, regarding the \nremaining debts, it is unclear why, if he was running a business and then chose to return \nto school, he was not paying closer attention to his finances. He became aware of his \ndelinquent debts when he received the government interrogatories in September 2022 \nthat listed them. He has not provided sufficient evidence to conclude he is resolving the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c and 1.e. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application. \nApplicant said he disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The credit bureau did not resolve \nthe dispute in his favor. He did not provide any other evidence regarding this debt. He \nrepeatedly claimed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was for a car payment that was current. The \ncredit report clearly shows it is a credit card debt on an account individually held. He did \nnot provide evidence of action he may have taken to dispute the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He \nhas not provided a reasonable basis for his disputes on these debts, documented proof \nto substantiate the basis of his disputes, or evidence of actions he has taken to resolve \nthe issues. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nApplicant provided evidence that he made two payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d \nbut failed to provide additional evidence beyond his statement that he is making \npayments. He provided a personal financial statement that shows he has a substantial \nmonthly remainder of expendable income. Without additional evidence to substantiate \nthat Applicant has continued to make payments towards this debt, I cannot apply AG \u00b6 \n20(d). It does apply to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f that was resolved in 2020. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has received financial counseling. He reports \nthat his finances are under control, and he is paying his bills on time. However, he has \nnot resolved some of the debts alleged in the SOR, so I cannot find there are clear \nindications that his problems are resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. An applicant who waits until his clearance \nis in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking the judgment expected of those with \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nBecause he requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no \nopportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor or to question him \nabout the circumstances that led to his financial problems. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nSome mitigating evidence was provided, but it was insufficient to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised. Applicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 18, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 19, 2023 and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 15, 2023. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nSeptember 26, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 24, 2023. The \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant and five witnesses testified on \nhis behalf. He offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. There were no objections to \nany exhibits offered, and they were admitted into evidence. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on November 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 24 years old. He graduated from high school in 2017 and college in \n2020. He is not married and has no children. He has worked for a federal contractor since \n2020. (Tr. 106-107; GE 1) \nApplicant was employed during the summers as an intern for different companies\nwhile he was in college. Since he was a young boy, his dream was to work as an engineer \nin aerospace and be on the cutting edge of the newest technology. He was focused \nthroughout high school to achieve that goal. He was valedictorian of his class and went \non to a prestigious college, where he graduated with a degree in aerospace engineering \nSumma Cum Laude. He did not use drugs in high school and consumed alcohol on a \nminimal basis. At college, he consumed alcohol in moderation and not to excess. (Tr. 83-\nGE 3) \n \nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nJanuary 2020. As part of the process, he participated in a drug test, testing negative. He \ndid not report any drug use in his SF 86. He completed the SF 86 so he could work as an \nintern for a federal contractor. (Tr. 84; Answer to SOR, Tab C) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer and his testimony, he stated that during his sophomore \nyear of college he lived with three men, two of whom used marijuana daily. He was offered \nit daily and declined. He estimated he declined their offers more than 300 times. (GE 2; \nAnswer to SOR, Tab C) \nApplicant\u2019s sister was using marijuana daily. During his senior year of college in \nMarch or April 2020, he and his mother went to visit his sister in another state where she \nwas living. His sister begged him to try marijuana and told him there were no \nconsequences. In an effort to reconnect with his sister, he used marijuana out of curiosity. \nIt was legal in the state where he used it. He did not enjoy it. (Tr. 85-86; GE 3; Answer to \nSOR, Tab C) \nIn 2020, Applicant\u2019s parents were going through a divorce. Due to the pandemic, \nthey were still living together in the family home. Applicant was also living at home at the \ntime and was unable to escape the conflict because of the lockdown. He felt pressured \nby each parent. They were in the process of selling the family home where he grew up \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand had his childhood memories. He was eager to move back to school and did so in \nSeptember 2020. He intended on graduating early and because it was difficult to rent a \nhouse for less than 12 months, he decided to live in the basement of a friend\u2019s house. \nWhen he arrived and moved in, sight unseen, he realized he made a mistake. The \nbasement was not finished and had concrete dust raining down from the ceiling, which \nwould wake him as it covered his nose and mouth. He moved out a week later and moved \nin with a good friend who lived in another town and had three roommates. These \nroommates used marijuana extensively. About two weeks later, Applicant and his \nroommates were in lockdown due to one of the roommates testing positive for Covid. Two \nweeks later another tested positive, another week and a different roommate tested \npositive. Applicant stated there was nothing to do during lockdown except eat, sleep, \nstudy, and hang out. He admitted during this time, he gave into the pressure and used \nmarijuana with varying frequency (12-16 times) for about 13-15 weeks. He again used it \none time in December 2020, as he prepared to move to a new state. It was legal in the \nstate where he used it. (Tr. 86-90; GE 3; Answer to SOR, Tab C) \nAfter graduating college in December 2020, Applicant moved to a new state eager \nto start his career, but he found out that the position he had accepted was no longer \navailable, and he was placed in a different position. He was not provided a workstation \nand was required to work remotely. He was not given many tasks and was bored. He \nbegan to seriously question whether he made the correct career choice and if those \navenues even existed for him any longer. While taking full responsibility for his conduct, \nhe stated that these circumstances contributed to his poor judgment when, in July 2021, \nhe used marijuana again with his sister, on her birthday. It was legal in the state where \nhe used it. (Tr. 90-91, 104; Answer to SOR, Tab C) \nIn October 2021, Applicant contracted Covid. Due to the company\u2019s vaccine \nrequirements, he had two weeks to get the vaccine. He attempted to get a medical waiver \ndue to recently having Covid, but it was denied. He got the vaccine but had a serious \nnegative reaction because he got it too close to having the virus. This incident made him \nquestion his future with the company and contributed to his stress level. He also had \ntotaled his vehicle while driving from where he worked to his home state, which left him \nstranded. He explained that these stressors contributed to him using marijuana in \nDecember 2021, when he used his sister\u2019s marijuana vape pen. (Tr. 104; Answer to SOR, \nTab C) \nApplicant was granted a secret security clearance in 2020 while he was working \nas an intern. In late 2021, he was read into a special access program (SAP). At the time \nhe used marijuana in December 2021, he did not officially work in the program, but he \ntestified that the SAP involved access to classified information. He began working in the \nprogram in January 2022. (Tr. 90-91) \nApplicant\u2019s perspective changed once he began to work in a program where he \nwas able to use his skills and was given responsibilities. He was realizing his childhood \ndreams. He also began to understand the seriousness of handling sensitive and classified \ninformation. Before then, he was a young college kid with a clearance, without a true \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nunderstanding of its importance. He was now a member of a program with a sworn duty \nto protect secrets. He testified that once he started working in the SAP, he had a real \nappreciation for the seriousness and importance of holding a security clearance. This was \nnot something that was emphasized when he was initially granted a clearance. (Tr. 91-\n94; Answer to the SOR, Tab C) \nApplicant has a new perspective and understanding of the highs and lows of a \ncareer path. He believes a myriad of circumstances negatively influenced him which \ncontributed to him using poor judgment. He never had a desire to use marijuana, but \ncircumstances influenced him. He is now in a position where he has more control over \nwhere he lives and who he associates with. He credibly testified that he is shocked that \nhe used marijuana without considering the consequences. He has participated in therapy \nregarding his parents\u2019 divorce. He felt like he was the glue holding his family together \nwhen they were all living together during the pandemic. Both parents were leaning on him \nand relying on him, which was stressful. (Tr. 94-97, 104-105; Answer to the SOR, Tab C) \nApplicant\u2019s sister stopped using marijuana when she became pregnant and has \nnot resumed since giving birth. He testified that she has abstained from drugs, alcohol, \nand nicotine for over two years. His current roommate is also an employee with the same \nfederal contractor and holds a security clearance. His roommate does not use illegal \ndrugs and has not witnessed Applicant using any. Applicant started an initiative to cease \nconsumption of alcohol for an extended period and did so for eight months. It was an \nexercise in discipline. He did not overindulge before but wanted to challenge himself. He \nsought drug counseling to evaluate whether he had any drug or alcohol-related issues. \nNone were detected and he was advised that no further treatment was recommended. \nMost of his friends work for federal contractors and do not use illegal drugs. His few close \nfriends from high school do not use illegal drugs. He credibly testified that he never \nintends to use illegal drugs again. (Tr. 97-98, 100-101, 108-112; Answer to SOR, Tabs D \nand E) \nIn January 2022, Applicant completed another SF 86. In it he disclosed his prior \nmarijuana use. After submission of the SF 86, on his own volition, he took a drug test to \ndemonstrate his level of commitment to remain drug-free. The test was negative. \nApplicant was unaware that he was required to report his drug use. Once he became \naware, he notified his security manager. (Tr. 85, 99; GE 1; Answer to SOR, Tab E) \nFive witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. They were his current roommate, \none whom he currently works for, and two with whom he has worked with, and a friend. \nThey have known him both professionally and personally. Essentially, they all provided \nthe same positive comments, noting he is reliable, trustworthy and exercises good \njudgment and provided examples. There is no evidence that he currently associates with \nknown drug users. They reported that he works well under pressure and manages stress \non the job by working hard to find a solution to the problem. All, except one, holds a \nsecurity clearance. All recommended Applicant retain his. (Tr. 23-81, 99-101) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided character letters, which stated he was a good citizen, patriot, \nintelligent, mature, respectful, and trustworthy. He follows rules and regulations and is a \nperson of integrity. (Answer to SOR, Tab D) \nApplicant provided a signed statement of intent not to use any illegal drugs in the \nfuture and any violation will constitute grounds for automatic revocation of his security \nclearance. (Tr. 101-102; Answer to SOR, Tab E). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n5 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from April 2020 to December \n2020. He used it again in July 2021 and December 2021. His use in December 2021 \nwas after being read into a SAP and he had access to classified information. He did not \nbegin to work in the program until January 2022. The above disqualifying conditions \napply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant voluntarily disclosed his past illegal drug use in his January 2022 SF 86, \nand he reported it to his security manager when he learned he was required to do so. His \ntestimony was candid and forthcoming. He recognizes his errors in judgment. Applicant\u2019s \nuse of marijuana from April 2020 to December 2020 occurred while he was still in college \nand worked as an intern in the summer. He signed a statement to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement, acknowledging that any future involvement will result in revocation of his \nclearance. The evidence strongly supports that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was infrequent. \nIn addition to being a young college student, the pressures of being in lockdown during \nthe pandemic and minimal options of where he could live, being put in a different job than \nwhat was promised and being bored, along with the stressors associated with his parents\u2019 \ndivorce all were unique circumstances that contributed to his poor decisions. \nApplicant takes full responsibility for his conduct. He candidly testified that until he \nbegan to work in a program that required him to have actual access to classified \ninformation, he did not have an appreciation for the responsibilities and duties required of \nthose holding a security clearance. He does now. His conduct can be characterized as \nyouthful indiscretions. Despite only being 24, he has grown and matured. Future drug use \nis highly unlikely to recur. His conduct does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment. He is no longer in an environment where drugs are being \nused and he does not associate with known drug users. His sister has been abstinent for \nmore than two years. Although he used marijuana after being granted a security \nclearance and access to classified information, a serious transgression, I find the above \nmitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress b a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from April 2020 to December \n2020. He used it again in July 2021 and December 2021. The above disqualifying \ncondition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressor, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce the vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nThe drug involvement security concerns discussed above were cross-alleged \nunder the personal conduct security concerns. The same facts and analysis apply. In \naddition, use of drugs while holding a security clearance is not a minor offense. I believe \nfuture misuse of drugs is unlikely to recur and Applicant has taken steps to reduce \nvulnerability, exploitation, or duress through his commitment to remain drug-free. I find \nthere is sufficient evidence to apply the above mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n8 \n\n \n \n_____________________________ \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. In my whole-person assessment, I find \nthe record evidence does not leave me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

(\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) In April 2017, he was charged with felony possession of \ndangerous drugs, including marijuana. He was convicted of possession of dangerous \ndrugs and received a sentence that included two years of probation, which was due to \nexpire in July 2023. (\u00b6 1.d) \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline E, that Applicant used marijuana on various \noccasions between 2003 and 2017, and that he sold illegal drugs in 2017.

The officer \nbelieved he smelled marijuana coming from Applicant and asked to search his car. \nApplicant consented to the search, but no marijuana was discovered. Applicant was \ngiven a ticket for possession of marijuana and chose to pay a fine of $150 rather than \ncontest the case in court. (Item 6, p. 6) \nIn October 2013, Applicant\u2019s car was stopped by a police officer. The officer \nbelieved he smelled marijuana coming from Applicant and asked to search his car. No \nillegal drugs were found from the search. The officer wrote Applicant a ticket for illegal \npossession of marijuana, based upon the officer\u2019s observations, and for illegal \npossession of Xanax, based again on the officer\u2019s observations. Applicant contested \nthese charges and they were dismissed by a judge. (Item 6, p. 7) \nIn April 2017, local police arrived at Applicant\u2019s residence with a search warrant. \nThey discovered a prescription for OxyContin, in his girlfriend\u2019s name, and seven \nounces of marijuana. He told the police he took the OxyContin for back pain. He was \narrested at the time, then released. He was charged with various felony drug charges, \nincluding sale of marijuana, and possession and use of marijuana and OxyContin. In \nApril 2021, he pleaded guilty to lesser charges and was sentenced to 60 days in jail \n(deferred), two years of probation, and fines and court fees. Probation was to end in \nJuly 2023. There is no evidence as to the current status of his probation. (Items 6 (p. 5, \n6, 13), 7-8) \nPersonal Conduct. \nApplicant admitted his use of marijuana from 2003 to 2017, and his sale of \nmarijuana in 2017. He used marijuana recreationally during his high school years and \nthrough the years until March 2017. He asserts that he stopped using and possessing \ndrugs after his felony arrest in 2017. He further asserts he has no future intent to use or \npossess illegal drugs. (Items 2, 6, p. 6, 11-12) \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 2008 SCA, he marked \u201cNo\u201d to the question of whether he had \nillegally used any controlled substances within the last seven years. In an earlier \nquestion in the SCA asking about his police record, he identified a 2004 arrest for \npossession of marijuana. In his SOR answer, he denied this allegation stating that he \neither misread or misunderstood the question. (Item 2, 4 (pp. 25-26 of 29)) \nIn Applicant\u2019s February 2021 SCA, he marked \u201cNo\u201d to questions of whether he \nhad illegally used, possessed, or sold any controlled substances within the last seven \nyears. In an earlier question in the SCA asking about his police record, he identified a \n2004 arrest for possession of marijuana, his 2012 arrest for possession of marijuana, \nand his 2017 felony arrest for various marijuana possession and sale charges.

(See \u00b6 2.e) \nFinancial Considerations. \nApplicant admitted failing to timely file his 2013 to 2019 federal and state income \ntax returns. He stated that in 2013 he became homeless and did not have an address \nwhere his IRS W-2 tax form could be sent. He was unemployed from August 2012 to \nJanuary 2014. He claims he did not have the means to pay his taxes during this \ntimeframe. In his February 2021 SCA, he stated that he finally had the means to file his \ndelinquent tax returns. He stated, \u201cI had planned to handle it and [sic] the beginning of \nthe tax year with a tax lawyer.\u201d He failed to provide any evidence that his 2013-2019 \nfederal and state tax returns have been filed. IRS tax transcripts, generated in July \n2022, for tax years 2018 and 2019, show that no returns were filed for those years. \nApplicant\u2019s tax filings for 2013-2019 have not been resolved. (Items 2, 3 (pp. 52-55 of \n61), 5-6) \nApplicant admitted owing on six delinquent debts totaling approximately $11,976. \nAll the debts appear on his credit reports. He stated in his background interview that his \nintention was to pay the debts now that he had a well-paying job. He failed to present \nany evidence reflecting the current status of these debts or if he had made any efforts to \nresolve them. These debts are unresolved. (Items 2, 6, 9-11) \nApplicant has not received financial counseling and he presented no budgetary \ninformation. (Item 6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Potentially applicable conditions include: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted; and \n(c)individual is currently on parole or probation. \nBetween 2004 and 2017, Applicant was arrested or cited four times for marijuana \nuse or possession. This culminated with his 2021 felony conviction, from his 2017 \narrest, for marijuana possession. His sentence for his 2021 conviction included two \nyears of probation that was to end in July 2023. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a)-31(c) all apply. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nWhile a number of years have passed since Applicant\u2019s last drug arrest in 2017, \nhe also has a history of drug involvement over time and resuming his involvement after \nlong periods of abstention. This makes his current period of abstention less persuasive \nthat it constitutes changed behavior. Additionally, there is no information in the record \nregarding the end of his probation and even if it did end in July 2023, insufficient time \nhas passed to determine whether Applicant has changed his criminal behavior absent \nthe threat of a probation violation. Neither of the mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Potentially applicable conditions include: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources. \nApplicant denied that he deliberately provided false information when he \ncompleted his 2008 and 2021 SCAs. The Government has the burden to establish \nApplicant\u2019s deliberateness or intent to falsify under this disqualifying condition. Applicant \nstated that he misread or misunderstood the relevant questions, thus requiring the \nGovernment to establish his intent. Applicant\u2019s listing of his drug arrests in other \nsections of those SCAs provides circumstantial support for his argument that he \nmisread or misunderstood the questions. If his intent was to mislead the Government \nabout his drug involvement, then he most likely would not have listed these drug \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \narrests. The Government did not provide any contrary evidence regarding intent. Given \nthis information, AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established as it relates to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.d. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions of multiple marijuana uses between 2004 and 2017, and \nhis sale of the same, reflect questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are not perfectly applicable because the \nalleged conduct is sufficient and explicitly covered for an adverse determination under \nthe drug involvement and substance misuse guideline. However, the general concerns \nabout questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established as it relates to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.c. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct and financial considerations-tax issues are cross-\nalleged under Guideline E. His criminal conduct was discussed supra and is adopted \nhere. His failure to file federal and state income tax returns is discussed infra. Both \ntypes of conduct reflect questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are not perfectly applicable because the \nalleged conduct is sufficient and explicitly covered for an adverse determination under \nthe criminal conduct and financial considerations guidelines. However, the general \nconcerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana involvement, his criminal offenses, and his failure to file his \nfederal and state tax returns from 2013 to 2019 are not minor actions nor infrequent. \nThey also cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b617(c) does \nnot apply. Although Applicant claims he will not use illegal drugs in the future, it is too \nsoon past his probation period to determine whether he will adhere to that commitment. \nAdditionally, he failed to address his tax-filing problem, despite his earlier statement of \nintent to do so. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19. Potentially applicable conditions include: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe record evidence supports that Applicant failed to timely file his 2013-2019 \nfederal and state income tax returns as he was required to do. The evidence also \nsupports that he incurred six delinquent debts. I find the above disqualifying conditions \nare raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has failed to take any meaningful action to address his delinquent tax-\nfiling issues regarding his federal and state income tax returns for the years alleged. He \nalso failed to take any action to resolve his delinquent debts and provide proof thereof. \nNeither of the above listed mitigating conditions apply. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his military service and \nhis unemployment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline J, \ncriminal conduct, Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs    2.a, 2.c, 2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs    2.b, 2.d:  \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   3.a-3.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On April 28, 2023, Applicant submitted four \ndocuments, AE L-O, without objection, which I admitted into evidence. The record closed \non May 2, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all five of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a - 1.e. Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old financial manager employed by a government contractor \nsince January 2019. His current annual salary in $114,800. He previously worked with \nother government contractors since 2016. In September 2004, he enlisted in the U.S. Air \nForce, and he remained on active duty until his honorable discharge in July 2014. He had \none deployment to Southwest Asia and Kuwait. He married in 2013, separated in 2019, \nand divorced in August 2021. He has two young sons. He requires a DOD security \nclearance to perform his employment duties. (Tr. 27-31, 40; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant started to experience financial difficulties after getting married in 2013. \nHis ex-spouse\u2019s parents agreed to pay for the wedding, but they changed their minds and \nprovided financial assistance to another family member instead. Applicant had to pay for \nthe unanticipated wedding expenses, which caused him to experience financial problems. \nIn addition, shortly after they were married, they had a child and his wife stopped working \noutside their home. She decided to start a business from home selling Mary Kay \ncosmetics. In order for his ex-wife to start her new business venture, he was required to \npurchase inventory supplies and pay for her travel and business retreats. Her business \nwas unsuccessful, and she was unable to earn any income. By the time they separated \nin 2019, Applicant found about $2,000 of unopened Mary Kay inventory in their home. In \ntheir divorce, and he became responsible for all of the outstanding joint accounts. He is \ncurrent on his monthly child support payments of approximately $1,200. (Tr. 30-33, 59\u00ad\n60) \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling $42,737, and the record establishes \nthe status of Applicant\u2019s accounts as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant is indebted to a bank creditor on a charged-off account \nfor $19,123. This debt resulted in a judgment being entered against Applicant in October \n2022, and he immediately notified his facility security officer of this legal action. A \nSatisfaction of Judgment was issued in February 2023. This debt has been resolved.

(Tr. 37-38, 55-57; AE F) \nApplicant said that he re-established contact with the SOR creditors after he \nreceived the SOR in December 2022. He had a savings account with over $10,000. He \nsaved this money to finance a move to another state so he could be closer to his sons. \nAfter he received the SOR, he hired counsel to help him negotiate with his creditors and \nto represent him during his security clearance hearing. Based on his counsel\u2019s advice, he \nused the money in his savings account to resolve several or of the SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s \nfinances are now stable. He still maintains a savings account, and he is current on filing \nall of his income tax returns. (Tr. 51-57, 61-62) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .

May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) and requires additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \nFour financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017): See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling $42,737. Applicant\u2019s debts resulted \nfrom unexpected wedding expenses, his ex-spouse\u2019s failed business and lack of income, \nand from the financial effects of his divorce. These are circumstances largely beyond his \ncontrol. Notwithstanding these unforeseen events that impacted his finances, Applicant \nmust demonstrate that he acted responsibly in dealing with his financial issues under the \ncircumstances. \nApplicant paid, settled, or is currently repaying all of the SOR debts. It is well-\nestablished that the timing of debt payments is a relevant consideration in evaluating \nwhether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner in addressing \nfinancial \nproblems. \nFor \nexample, \nto \nreceive \nfull \ncredit \nunder \nMitigating Condition 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(d). The Appeal Board has \nconsistently held that a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d generally requires that an applicant has \nestablished a meaningful financial track record of payments, to include evidence of actual \ndebt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). \nApplicant used the money he held in his savings account to pay off his debts. He \nwas saving that money to move to the state where his children are located. Instead, he \nhired counsel who helped him negotiate with his creditors and he followed his legal advice \nto get his finances in order. Applicant\u2019s finances are currently stable, and he has resumed \ndepositing money into his savings account. He is committed to repaying his last two \ndelinquent SOR debts in accordance with the established payment plans. \nApplicant made significant progress resolving his delinquent debts. He has \ndemonstrated good faith in resolving his delinquent debts. There are clear indications that \nhis financial problem is being resolved, and his finances are under control. Future \nfinancial problems are unlikely to occur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are established, and \nfinancial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has resolved three of the alleged debts and is currently repaying the \nother two debts per the terms of his repayment agreements. Applicant\u2019s actions show \nfinancial responsibility and good judgment, and he has established his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. I have carefully \napplied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

He is the process of receiving his associate degree, and \nhe will attend a university in the fall of 2023. He has been employed by a federal contractor \nsince February 2022. (Item 2 at 9, 10-11 and Response.)  \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in March 2022, he disclosed that he used \nmarijuana from about January 2018 through September 2021, describing the use as \n\u201cevery now and then treated as a celebratory\u201d and added he was \u201cnot a frequent smoker.\u201d \n(Item 2 at 26.) He then noted \u201cif not prohibited to be used for work purposes then I would \nmost likely continue to use it every so often. But if my work prohibits I will not.\u201d (Item 2 at \n26.) He fully discussed his drug use during his background interview in May 2022. In the \ninterview he described his use as about once every six months, typically on a special \noccasion and added he does not seek it out. While he expressed that he would \u201clikely\u201d \npartake in use in the future he added he would not partake if is required by his employer \nto stop. (Item 3 at 8 of interview.) He responded similarly in his interrogatory response. \n(Item 3 at 2-3.) In his interrogatory response he updated his date of last use of marijuana \nto September 2022. (Item 3 at 2) In support of his statements, he submitted his most \nrecent drug screening results from March 27, 2023, RE-C, and his certificate of \ncompletion of a drug and alcohol awareness class dated April 1, 2023, RE-B. \nIn his Response he stated he completed the SCA and DoD interrogatories with the \n\u201cmind set of honesty being the best policy in the questions that were asked\u2026.\u201d He \naffirmed he is fit to carry out his responsibilities, as well as manage himself accordingly, \nand that he will not smoke marijuana nor partake in any environment or people that \naffiliate with illegal substances.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admission in his answer to the SOR and the information in the FORM \nare sufficient to raise the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a): \u201cany substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and (c) illegal possession of a \ncontrolled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security. \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant used marijuana in September 2022, after \nhe submitted his SCA in March 2022, and after he was interviewed for his background \ninvestigation in May 2022. The Appeal Board has \u201clong held that applicants who use \nmarijuana after having been placed on notice of the security significance of such conduct \nmay be lacking in the judgment and reliability expected of those with access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2021). See also ISCR \nCase No. 21-02534 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2023) (\u201c[A]fter applying for a security \nclearance and being adequately placed on notice that such conduct was inconsistent with \nholding a security clearance, an applicant who continues to use marijuana demonstrates \na disregard for security clearance eligibility standards, and such behavior raises \nsubstantial questions about the applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d) \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is partially established. Applicant fully disclosed his drug involvement \non his SCA, and throughout the security clearance process, which bolsters his credibility. \nHe consistently stated throughout the security clearance process that if his work prohibits \ndrug use, he will not use illegal drugs. The consistency in his responses and his \nsupporting documents make his Response credible that he does not intend to use illegal \ndrugs in the future. His Response shows his intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds \nfor revocation of national security eligibility; however, it does not precisely incorporate all \nthe terms of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nSomeone who picks and chooses what laws he will follow is not a good candidate \nfor a security clearance. Applicant does not currently hold a security clearance. His recent \ncontingent promise that he will not use illegal drugs if he is granted a security clearance \ndoes not generate confidence that he has not continued to use illegal drugs or that he will \nnot use them in the future. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable, and \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use is not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n      \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a-b:  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 58 years old and has been employed since November 2022 as a network engineer by her current security clearance sponsor, a DoD contractor. She earned an associate degree in 1996 and has taken additional college-level courses. She has been married and divorced three times and has two adult children. (Tr. at 20-22, 40\u00ad 41; GE 1 at 7, 14-15, 24-27, 29-30; GE 2 at 7, 14-15, 24-27.) Applicant was first granted a security clearance in 2006, which was renewed in 2016 following her submission of an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing on September 8, 2016 (2016 e-QIP). Applicant\u2019s submission of her 2019 e- QIP was in connection with her employer\u2019s request that she receive a Top Secret clearance, which was granted in 2020. A subsequent investigation was undertaken in response to her employer\u2019s request that Applicant receive eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). The SOR is based upon new facts about Applicant\u2019s past involvement with drugs uncovered during the SCI investigation and her failure to disclose her more recent use of marijuana on her 2016 e-QIP and her 2019 e-QIP.

On November 18, 2022, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse) and E (Personal Conduct).

Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nMarch 21, 2023, and the case was assigned to me on March 28, 2023. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Microsoft TEAMS Video \nTeleconference Hearing on April 10, 2023, scheduling the case to be heard on May 3, \n2023. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which I admitted without objection. Applicant submitted 17 \nexhibits, marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through Q and testified on her own behalf. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 10, 2023. (Tr. at 11-15.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 58 years old and has been employed since November 2022 as a \nnetwork engineer by her current security clearance sponsor, a DoD contractor. She \nearned an associate degree in 1996 and has taken additional college-level courses. She \nhas been married and divorced three times and has two adult children. (Tr. at 20-22, 40\u00ad\n41; GE 1 at 7, 14-15, 24-27, 29-30; GE 2 at 7, 14-15, 24-27.) \nApplicant was first granted a security clearance in 2006, which was renewed in \n2016 following her submission of an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing on September 8, 2016 (2016 e-QIP). Applicant\u2019s submission of her 2019 e-\nQIP was in connection with her employer\u2019s request that she receive a Top Secret \nclearance, which was granted in 2020. A subsequent investigation was undertaken in \nresponse to her employer\u2019s request that Applicant receive eligibility for access to sensitive \ncompartmented information (SCI). The SOR is based upon new facts about Applicant\u2019s \npast involvement with drugs uncovered during the SCI investigation and her failure to \ndisclose her more recent use of marijuana on her 2016 e-QIP and her 2019 e-QIP. (Tr. \nat 9, 42; GE 1 at 47-48, 49-50; GE 2 at 36-37; GE 5.) \nParagraph 1 - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause of her past drug involvement. Specifically, the SOR alleged that Applicant used \nmarijuana on two occasions, December 2013 and May 2016, after having been granted \naccess to classified information (SOR \u00b6 1.a). In her Answer Applicant admitted the \nallegation under this guideline and wrote that, \u201cI chose to use marijuana on these two \noccasions knowing that I was behaving in sharp contrast to my promise to the United \nStates.\u201d She added, \u201cThere have been no other times I have used any controlled \nsubstance during any time while holding a clearance from 2006 until this day.\u201d (Answer.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that prior to 1995 she had a 13-year history of being a drug \nabuser who smoked marijuana and used methamphetamine, almost daily. She also drank \nalcohol excessively. In 1988, she was involuntarily hospitalized due an incident involving \nexcessive drinking of alcohol. In 1995 Applicant\u2019s co-habitant forced her to leave their \nresidence because of her addictions. She went to live with her sister, who assisted \nApplicant in becoming sober. Applicant was successful and maintained sobriety for 17 \nyears through her participation in Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and the help of her family. \n(Tr. at 24; GE 1 at 45-46; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2.) \nIn 2012 Applicant started drinking alcohol again when she was working as a \ndefense contractor on a remote location of a U.S territory. She testified that there was \nlittle or no support systems for someone with Applicant\u2019s history of addictions. She \nthought that there was no reason she could not drink alcohol like a \u201cgrown-up.\u201d Her \nconsumption of alcohol developed into daily drinking to the point of intoxication. She also \nsmoked marijuana on two occasions while granted access to classified information, as \nalleged in the SOR (see below). After four years, she left her job in the remote location \nand relocated to State 1. She wanted to stop drinking alcohol, but she found it was more \ndifficult to do that in 2017 than it was the first time. She also started attending NA meetings \nagain. In 2019, she found employment at a U.S. military base in State 2 and relocated to \nState 2 for her new job. Her drinking continued until May 2019. She finally found the \nsupport she needed to control her alcohol consumption. (Tr. at 23-27, 36-38; GE 3 at 6\u00ad\n7; GE 4 at 3.) \nApplicant testified that the sister of her former boyfriend urged Applicant to smoke \nmarijuana with her on two occasions, once in 2013 and again in 2016. Applicant made \nthe choice of smoking marijuana on both occasions. Both instances occurred while \nApplicant was visiting her boyfriend on the mainland of the United States. She has not \nused any illegal drugs since 2016. (Answer; Tr. at 26-28, 39; GE 3 at 7, 9; GE 4 at 3.) \nParagraph 2 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible \nfor a security clearance because she has engaged in conduct that involves questionable \njudgment, an unwillingness to follow rules and regulations, a lack of candor, and \ndishonesty. The DoD CAF alleged that Applicant falsified her answer to the question in \nSection 23 of the 2016 e-QIP about prior illegal drug use by failing to disclose her use of \nmarijuana in 2013 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). The SOR also alleged under this guideline that Applicant \nfalsified her answer to the same question in Section 23 of the 2019 e-QIP by failing to \ndisclose her uses of marijuana in 2013 and 2016 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn her Answer Applicant admitted both allegations in paragraph 2 of the SOR. She \nwrote, \u201cThere is no justification I can give for these decisions to falsify my investigations. \nIt was bad judgment, and I can expect nothing less than having my clearance revoked.\u201d \nShe added: \nI am proud to have the privilege of working for our military. I understand the \nresponsibility that comes with that privilege and that I have broken the trust \nthat the U.S. government had in me by making these false statements. I can \nassure you that I understand the consequences that our military personnel \nand our country could face due to questionable judgment. I can promise you \nthat my judgment regarding any information that I have been privy to has \nnever been in question. (Answer at 1.) \nApplicant concluded her comments in her Answer by writing, \u201cI want to assure the US \nGovernment of my sincere desire to repair the trust that has been given to me and that I \nwill continue to be a good steward of that trust.\u201d (Answer at 1.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that she deliberately provided a false answer to \nthe question in Section 23 of the 2016 e-QIP. She testified that she was scared to admit \nher use of marijuana in 2013 because it might make her ineligible to work for her \ngovernment contractor. In addition, she was drinking alcohol to excess at the time and \nthat clouded her judgment. At the time she completed her 2019 e-QIP, Applicant had \nstopped drinking alcohol. She again did not report her marijuana uses in 2013 and 2016 \nbecause she was again afraid of losing her job. At her initial background interview, she \ndid not disclose her marijuana use in 2013 and 2016. An investigator interviewed \nApplicant\u2019s sister in January 2020, and the sister told the investigator about Applicant\u2019s \ndifficult history with drugs and alcohol and her active participation in NA. (Tr. at 28-31; GE \n3 at 4-6; GE 5.) \nApplicant\u2019s sister advised Applicant that evening about the interview. Applicant \nrealized that she had to tell the investigator the truth about her drug history and her use \nof marijuana in 2013 and 2016. She wrote the investigator an email the next morning and \nadmitted to the investigator that she had lied in her interview by not disclosing her past \ndrug use and her current involvement in NA. The SOR does not contain an allegation that \nshe provided false information to the investigator. At the hearing, she insisted that she \nwould never again place her own self-interest ahead of her national security \nresponsibilities. She feels a particularly strong duty to be honest for the sake of our military \nmembers. (Tr. at 31-34; GE 5.) \nPsychological Evaluation \nThe DoD CAF requested that Applicant submit to a psychological evaluation. The \nevaluation was conducted by a DoD psychologist in May 2021. He provided a report, \ndated June 8, 2021. In his report, the psychologist provided an even-handed prognosis \nin which he credited Applicant \u201cfor utilizing her resources and reportedly maintaining \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsobriety for 17 years.\u201d He also noted that \u201cwith the right combination of support, she \nappears to be able to successfully manage her addiction.\u201d He commented, however, \u201cthat \nan absence or removal of some of her supports can cause her to fall back into using drugs \nor alcohol again, even after long periods of sobriety.\u201d He believes that it cannot be known \nif [Applicant\u2019s current] stability will be maintained or follow the patterns of the past. \nSignificantly, he wrote that \u201cthe disclosure of [Applicant\u2019s] marijuana use in 2013 and 2016 \nwas not forthright and [was] only discovered by [an] offhand comment which raises \nconcerns as to whether future reportable events will be brought forward with integrity.\u201d \nThe Psychologist believes that Applicant \u201chas a condition which impairs her judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness and should be carefully considered.\u201d (GE 4 at 5.) \nMitigation and Whole-Person Evidence \nApplicant has worked for the U.S. military for the past 19 years and considers this \nwork as the best experience of her career. She is a member of NA and attends meetings \nregularly. She believes she has a large support system that has helped her maintain her \nsobriety. (Tr. at 17, 34-35.) \nApplicant sincerely expressed remorse for lying to the Government about her past. \nShe admits she lied on her applications out of fear for losing her job. She recognizes that \nher skills are transferrable to the private sector, but she does not want to lose the \nopportunity to serve the U.S. military. (Tr. at 18-19.) \nPrior to the hearing, Applicant submitted 17 character-reference letters. Eight \nreference letters from professional contacts praised Applicant\u2019s responsibility and \ndependability. She maintains excellent security practices and can be relied upon to \nprotect classified information. The writers also praise her personal qualities, particularly \nher work ethic, honesty, and interpersonal skills. (AE A through H.) \nApplicant also submitted seven reference letters from personal contacts, who \npraised her reliability, integrity, and authenticity. Friends who know Applicant through their \ninvolvement with her in NA write that Applicant is deeply committed to maintaining her \nsobriety. (AE I through O.) \nThe last two reference letters were written by Applicant\u2019s sister and Applicant\u2019s \nadult daughter. Her sister praised Applicant for the progress she has made in her life after \nmany difficult years struggling with drug addiction while raising a child on her own. She \nbelieves that Applicant today is a strong and trustworthy person. Applicant\u2019s daughter has \nwitnessed Applicant\u2019s struggles in life firsthand since she was born in 1984, and she \nbelieves that Applicant has grown into a mature and trustworthy person. (AE P and Q.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes the following two conditions that raise security concerns and \nmay potentially be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer and her detailed testimony regarding her \nsubstance misuse establish the above potentially disqualifying conditions and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by her conduct. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nBoth of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s last drug use \noccurred more than seven years ago and was infrequent and under unusual \ncircumstances. Applicant acknowledges that her use of marijuana in 2013 and 2016 was \ninconsistent with her responsibilities as someone who has been granted access to \nclassified information and should never have occurred. Based on her abstinence over the \npast seven years, I conclude that this behavior is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn my mitigation analysis, I have also taken administrative notice of the Security \nExecutive Agent \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to \nAccess Classified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December \n21, 2021 (Guidance). In her Guidance, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) noted the \nincreased number of states that have legalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana. \nShe reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding the importance of compliance with \nFederal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by holders of security clearances. She \nprovided further clarification of Federal marijuana policy writing that this policy remains \nrelevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] not determinative.\u201d She noted that \nthe adjudicative guidelines provided various opportunities for a clearance applicant to \nmitigate security concerns raised by his or her past use of marijuana. (Guidance at 1.) \nParagraph 1 is resolved in favor of Applicant. \nParagraph 2 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following condition that may raise security concerns and \npotentially be disqualifying in this case. \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant admitted that she deliberately provided false responses in her 2016 and \n2019 e-QIPs to questions regarding her past illegal drug use. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established \nand shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by her conduct. \nThe guideline includes several conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s falsifications in her e-QIPs: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, of falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nNeither AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) nor (c) have been established. Applicant\u2019s correction of her \nomission from her 2016 e-QIP and her 2019 e-QIP regarding her use of illegal drugs \noccurred after her initial background interview in 2019. She made the correction only after \nan investigator had been advised by Applicant\u2019s sister that Applicant was a member of \nNA. At that point, Applicant knew that her deception had been uncovered, and she had \nto face the investigator and reveal her past involvement in illegal drugs, including smoking \nmarijuana in 2013 and 2016. Her falsifications were not minor offenses, and her behavior \ncasts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and (e) have been partially established. In 2020 Applicant disclosed \nher secret about her past drug use and alleviated the immediate circumstances that \ncaused her to be unreliable and untrustworthy. She also eliminated the potential for \nexploitation and duress regarding her past drug use. The timing of her positive steps and \nthe circumstances under which she was forced to make her disclosure, however, \nsignificantly undercut the mitigation value of her actions. As a result, these mitigating \nconditions have not been fully established. Paragraph 2 of the SOR is resolved against \nApplicant. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the whole-person \nfactors quoted above. Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by her deliberate falsifications about her illegal drug use in her \ne-QIPs. She is a mature and accountable adult who knowingly engaged in this deception \nin connection with two applications because she feared that the truth would disqualify her. \nThe likelihood of recurrence of this recent untrustworthiness remains significant. Overall, \nthe record evidence raises questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Paragraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has used illegal drugs. He admitted the single allegation under this paragraph with explanations. 1.a. Applicant smoked marijuana during two distinct periods of time. He smoked marijuana twice in approximately 2008 when he was in college. He derived no pleasure from it and did not use it again for almost 13 years. He admitted this use during a 2015 investigation. (Government Exhibit 3 at Section 23; Government Exhibit 4; Tr. 19, 29.) In 2021 Applicant began a relationship with his partner (Ms. One). Ms. One is a cancer survivor who uses marijuana to relieve pain from her treatment. In approximately June 2021, during the Covid pandemic, Applicant used marijuana about four times with Ms. One. He supplied no good reason for using marijuana at this time, particularly given the fact he has held a security clearance for many years.

The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on May 17, 2023. I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled on June 28, 2023.

Applicant \nrequested that the record remain open for submission of additional documentation. He \nsubmitted Applicant Exhibit F in a timely fashion, and it is admitted without objection. The \nrecord closed on July 14, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 35-year-old information systems security officer with a defense \ncontractor (Company A). He has worked for Company A since August 2019. He is single \nwith a partner and has a bachelor of science degree.

He smoked \nmarijuana twice in approximately 2008 when he was in college. He derived no pleasure \nfrom it and did not use it again for almost 13 years. He admitted this use during a 2015 \ninvestigation. (Government Exhibit 3 at Section 23; Government Exhibit 4; Tr. 19, 29.) \nIn 2021 Applicant began a relationship with his partner (Ms. One). Ms. One is a \ncancer survivor who uses marijuana to relieve pain from her treatment. In approximately \nJune 2021, during the Covid pandemic, Applicant used marijuana about four times with \nMs. One.

(Applicant Exhibit E; Tr. 26-28, 38.) \nMitigation \nApplicant is a successful performer. Positive statements were submitted by his \nmanager, his Facility Security Officer, and his Industrial Security Representative. He is \ndescribed by the writers as \u201chonest and trustworthy,\u201d \u201chard-working,\u201d and \u201ca dedicated \nand productive member of the [Company A] Cybersecurity team.\u201d The writers stated they \nare aware of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and believe this conduct to be an aberration that \nis in the past. (Applicant Exhibits A, B, and D; Tr. 36-37.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n3 \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant smoked marijuana two times in 2008 and approximately three to four \ntimes in June 2021. He held a Top Secret security clearance at the time of his use in \n2021. Both of the stated disqualifying conditions apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Guidance.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana (including State One) and sought to \n\u201cprovide clarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding the \nimportance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by \nholders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal marijuana \npolicy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] \nnot determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines provided various \nopportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns raised by his or her \npast use of marijuana. \nApplicant used marijuana in 2008 when in college and again in 2021. He held a \nsecurity clearance in 2021 and knew his conduct was against security regulations and \nFederal law. This latter conduct was situational in nature, brought about by his partner\u2019s \nuse of marijuana as a result of her cancer treatment and Covid. I have considered the \nfact that this was repeated conduct, although 12 years apart, and that he is a security \nclearance holder. This conduct was in the past and he stated convincingly that it will not \nbe repeated. He thoroughly understands the consequences of any future drug use or \nexposure. Viewing his marijuana use in the context of the whole person, Applicant has \nmitigated the security significance of his past drug involvement. Paragraph 1 is found for \nApplicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated his drug \nuse. His repeated and forthright disclosures on his e-QIPs, during interviews with OPM \ninvestigators, and at his hearing minimized or eliminated the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, or duress, and demonstrated his trustworthiness. Continuation or recurrence of \nsubstance misuse is unlikely. Overall, the record evidence does not create any doubt as \nto Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

He was living with his mother at the time and had no income. Although he obtained U.S. Department of Education student loans to help pay his tuition, he had to drop out of college because he could not afford to continue his education. In 2016, he started working for a company making approximately $22,000 a year. He enrolled into another college in 2016, and he had to drop out in 2019 due to a serious medical issue.

During the pandemic, he took advantage of the \nfederal student loan pause and focused on paying other debts. Beginning in March 2023, \nApplicant consolidated his six student loans with a consumer student loan company. He \nmade an initial payment of $299 in March 2023, and thereafter he has been making \nmonthly payments of $49 that are automatically withdrawn from his bank account.

They readily endorsed Applicant for DOD security clearance eligibility. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The SOR alleges delinquent debts and student loans \ntotaling approximately $33,800. The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. \nThe following financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant experienced financial difficulties after attending college with no income \nor while he was underemployed. From 2019 to early 2022 he was unemployed after he \nsuffered from a diabetic coma and was later diagnosed with diabetic neuropathy, which \nworsened his financial situation. These are circumstances beyond his control. However, \nto receive full credit for this mitigating condition, Applicant must demonstrate that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant made systematic monthly tuition payments of $810 after the completion \nof his technical certification, with one final month to pay to satisfy this account in full. With \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthis certification, he was hired by his current employer and earns an annual salary of \n$70,000. In March 2023, Applicant consolidated his U.S. Department of Education loans \nand has made good-faith monthly payments since that time. Beginning in December \n2023, it is his intention to use the budgeted amount of $810 to pay more money towards \nhis consolidated student loans, and to also make payment arrangements for his two \nremaining SOR creditors. \nApplicant earns sufficient income to pay all of his monthly expenses, to include \nputting some money away into his savings account for unforeseen emergencies. He has \nnot developed any new delinquent debt. It is his intention to pay his remaining financial \nobligations and to remain debt-free by following a monthly budget. He provided sufficient \ndocumentation to show his responsible efforts in resolving his delinquent student loans \nand consumer debts. Under the current circumstances, there is sufficient evidence to \nshow that his financial problems are under control and are unlikely to recur. Applicant has \nsuccessfully mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis. \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his or her off-duty conduct or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \ncircumstances can have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the \napplicant's national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by circumstances beyond his control, \nand he took responsible action in addressing them. His program manager and co-worker \npraised his strong work ethic and reliability. Applicant is committed to keeping his financial \naffairs in order, and I find that future financial problems are unlikely to recur. After \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility.

When confronted by \nthe investigator with two charged-off debts, he acknowledged them as private student \nloans. (Item 4 at 15.) He took these loans out in approximately 1999 and they went into \ncollection in around 2006. He stated he did not disclose the delinquent student loans on \nhis SCA because he did not want to look bad. He had utilized deferments while in the \nmilitary and later when he took classes between October 2015 and May 2018. He told the \ninvestigator since May 2018 he has tried to forget about his student loans.

Applicant disclosed that he had received inpatient treatment for alcohol \ndependency and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from June 2021 through August \n2021. (Item 3 and Item 4 at 14.) He acknowledged consuming a bottle of tequila a day \nfrom June 2020 until entering treatment in June 2021.

He cited a recent Halloween party as an example. (Item 4 at \n8.) He indicated he would be involved in an outpatient program. (Item 4 at 14.) \nApplicant did not submit any documentary evidence and did not respond to the \nFORM. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is established by Applicant\u2019s admissions that he deliberately falsified \nhis SCA responses regarding his marijuana use and delinquent accounts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nThe following mitigating conditions detailed in AG \u00b6 17 are potentially relevant: \n(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not promptly attempt to correct his \nSCA responses. He admitted his omissions only after being confronted with evidence \nduring his security clearance interview. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant's false statements were not \u201cminor,\u201d \nbecause such statements strike at the heart of the security clearance process. See ISCR \nCase No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) An applicant who deliberately fails to give \nfull, frank, and candid answers to the government in connection with a security clearance \ninvestigation or adjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \nISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). Applicant's false statements were \nrecent and calculated to give him a more favorable security clearance application. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is detailed in AG \u00b6 21: \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe following mitigating conditions detailed in AG \u00b6 22 are potentially applicable: \n(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant admitted that he drank a bottle of tequila a day for almost year until 2021. \nHe entered alcohol rehabilitation in 2021 and was diagnosed as alcohol dependent. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 22(c) and 22(d) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions detailed in AG \u00b6 23 are potentially applicable: \n(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c): the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress in \na treatment program; and \n(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has submitted no evidence that he is participating in an ongoing \ncounseling or outpatient treatment program or that he is making satisfactory progress in \nany treatment program. While he completed an inpatient treatment program in 2021 and \ndeclared he had the tools to abstain from alcohol and his consumption was \u201czero\u201d he \nacknowledges his alcohol consumption is one to two beers in a social setting.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline, as detailed in AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of  \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant admitted using and purchasing marijuana from about June 2016 to about \nNovember 2021 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b). AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions detailed in AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana may \nhave ended in August 2021 when he entered inpatient treatment. However, after \ncompleting treatment, which included monthly shots and patches to allow him to withdraw \nfrom marijuana, he continued to use marijuana until at least November 2021.

He acknowledged that he \ndid not disclose his marijuana involvement because he did not think his medical records \nwould be discovered. His actions after treatment and apparent continued association with \nothers who use marijuana are inconsistent with his statement that he had stopped using \nmarijuana. He did not provide sufficient evidence to establish this mitigating condition. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson's self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant's admissions and his credit reports establish the following disqualifying \ncondition under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) are not applicable. Applicant admits he has failed to settle \nthe alleged debts and intentionally ignored them for more than 15 years. His divorce \noccurred years after his loans became delinquent and before he joined the Army.

None of the above mitigating conditions are established for \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a or 4.b. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E, G, H, and F in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines E, G, \nH and F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1: Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4: Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a and 4.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 38 years old and has been employed by a DoD contractor since 2022. She has never married and has no children. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007 and a professional certification in 2009. She has owned her home since July 2017. Applicant was granted national security eligibility in about 2009. She seeks to reestablish her eligibility and be granted a security clearance in connection with her recently obtained employment. (Item 2 at 5, 7, 9-10, 18-19, 32-33.) Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR lists 18 debts that are charged-off or in collection. The total amount of the delinquent debts is approximately $43,000. The existence and amount of these debts are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer to all of the SOR allegations and by credit reports in the record, dated January 18, 2023; July 28, 2022; and December 28, 2021. (Items 3, 4, and 5.) Applicant disclosed in her e-QIP that her financial delinquencies were caused by difficult personal issues and other hardships over the past three years (2019-2021), which were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. She wrote that she hoped to begin repaying her debts once she was able to do so. According to her employment history",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on December 6, 2022, and \nrequested her case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. In her Answer \nApplicant admitted all 18 of the SOR allegations, and added a statement of her intentions \nto resolve the debts in the future. On January 19, 2023, Department Counsel submitted \nthe Department\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding Items 1 through 5, was provided to Applicant, who received the file on February \n2, 2023. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to raise objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She did not reply to the FORM or \nsubmit any documentation. The case was assigned to me on March 29, 2023. Department \nCounsel\u2019s Items 1 through 5 are admitted into evidence. Based upon a review of the \npleadings and the Government\u2019s evidence, national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 38 years old and has been employed by a DoD contractor since 2022. \nShe has never married and has no children. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007 \nand a professional certification in 2009. She has owned her home since July 2017. \nApplicant was granted national security eligibility in about 2009. She seeks to reestablish \nher eligibility and be granted a security clearance in connection with her recently obtained \nemployment. (Item 2 at 5, 7, 9-10, 18-19, 32-33.) \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible \nfor a clearance because she is financially overextended and therefore potentially \nunreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe SOR lists 18 debts that are charged-off or in collection. The total amount of the \ndelinquent debts is approximately $43,000. The existence and amount of these debts are \nsupported by Applicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer to all of the SOR allegations and by \ncredit reports in the record, dated January 18, 2023; July 28, 2022; and December 28, \n2021. (Items 3, 4, and 5.) \nApplicant disclosed in her e-QIP that her financial delinquencies were caused by \ndifficult personal issues and other hardships over the past three years (2019-2021), which \nwere exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. She wrote that she hoped to begin \nrepaying her debts once she was able to do so. According to her employment history in \nher e-QIP, she experienced five months of unemployment in 2021 and 13 months of \nunemployment in 2019-2020. The record is silent as to when she began working for the \nDoD contractor in 2022 and whether she had additional unemployment after she \nsubmitted her e-QIP in December 2021.

Also, I am unable to make a credibility assessment as Applicant elected not to \nhave a hearing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred about $43,000 in past-due accounts over the last three or four \nyears that remain unresolved. The 18 debts listed in the SOR, which Applicant admitted \nbeing delinquent, establish the application of the foregoing disqualifying conditions and \nshift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe record evidence does not establish any of the above mitigating conditions. \nApplicant asserted in her e-QIP, without any specific information, that her failure to pay \nher debts was due to personally and financially difficult times. It is apparent from her e-\nQIP that she experienced significant periods of unemployment. In her Answer, she \nclaimed that she had been in contact with her creditors \u201cto make future plans to repay as \nsoon as I\u2019m able.\u201d She also claimed that she had arranged payment plans with respect to \nfour of her SOR debts. However, she provided no documentary evidence or any details \nto show that she took any such steps or otherwise acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Also, she did not submit any financial information from which I can \ndetermine whether she is capable of resolving these debts in a reasonable, responsible, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand timely fashion. None of the above mitigating conditions have been established. \nParagraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by her past-due indebtedness. Financial irresponsibility is \nlikely to continue, and the potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains \nundiminished. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance \nat the present time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated the financial consideration concerns.

A hearing was scheduled for \nJune 23, 2023, via Microsoft Teams Teleconference Services, and was heard as \nscheduled. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of five exhibits. (GEs 1-5) \nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on July 7, 2023. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with updates on his student loan \npayment plan and other debts covered by the SOR. For good cause shown, Applicant \nwas granted 14 days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded two \ndays to respond. \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with his divorce file \n(inclusive of a final decree of divorce, a petition to modify his child support payments, \nand Applicant\u2019s counter-petition and child support order), along with a drug testing \ncertificate regarding his ex-wife, a payment plan covering the SOR \u00b6 1.f debt, a billing \nstatement covering the SOR \u00b6 1.h debt; a performance evaluation; a forbearance \nstatement confirming a pause in applicant\u2019s student loan accounts; a March 2022 \nconfirmation of Applicant\u2019s payments to his divorce attorney (undated); and a \nconferment alcohol disorder with respect to ex-spouse. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nsubmissions were admitted without objections AEs A- I. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated five delinquent \nDoE student loan debts exceeding $35,000 and four delinquent consumer debts \nexceeding $2,900. Allegedly, these debts remain unresolved and outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations with \nexplanations and clarifications. He denied the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.g \nand 1.i. For explanations covering his admitted debts, he claimed his 2020 divorce and \nrelated financial hardships (inclusive of his furnished care of his father-in-law who was \ninvolved in a serious auto accident in May 2018 and eventually passed away) before his \nseparation, and ultimate divorce. Applicant further claimed that he has been a single \ndad with full custody of his children since October 2020 and minimal help from his ex-\nwife. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(GEs 1 and 5 and AEs A and D; Tr. 27) He has two children from this \nmarriage (ages one and two). GE 1; Tr. 53) He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2014 \nand a master\u2019s degree in May 2016. (GEs 1; Tr. 39, 41) He reported no military service. \nSince August 2019, Applicant has worked for his current employer as a \nmanufacturing engineer. (GE 1; Tr. 49) Between May 2014 and September 2020, he \nworked in various jobs for non-DoD employers. (GE 1) He has never held a security \nclearance. (GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2015 and 2017, Applicant took out federal and state student loans to \nfinance his undergraduate and graduate education. (GEs 1-5 and AEs A-B and D-E; Tr. \n29) Burdened by child support and other financial obligations from his marriage, \nApplicant never made any payments on his student loans. (GEs 1-5; Tr. 29-30) After \nreceiving billing notices from the DoE in 2017 and 2018, he asked for extensions before \nputting his student loans aside without addressing them. (GE 5; Tr. 31) In 2022, \nApplicant received a letter notice from the DoE approving him for rehabilitation status. \n(AE D; Tr. 32) Because of the COVID-19 pause in place at the time, the DoE did not \nrequire upfront loan payments from Applicant. (AE D; Tr. 32)  \nApplicant assured that he would be able to make his payments when they \nbecome due after the pause is lifted in September 2023. (AEs D and G; Tr. 33) \nApplicant\u2019s assurances are both plausible and credible, considering all of the \nextenuating circumstances associated with his divorce, pre-divorce family care, and \nchild-rearing responsibilities he has assumed as a single parent, and are accepted. \nOther delinquent debts accumulated by Applicant between 2016 and 2018 are \ncomprised of four consumer debts as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f (for $639); 1.g (for $463); 1.h \n(for $1,052); and 1.i (for $921). (GEs 2-5; Tr. 33-48) These debts exceed $2,900 \nApplicant continues to dispute two of the debts, claiming identification theft with respect \nto SOR \u00b6 1.f and a lack of familiarity with the debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.g. (GEs 3-5; \nTr. 35-36) He documented a payment plan with SOR \u00b6 1.h that calls for monthly \npayments of $50 a month beginning in June 2023 (AE H; Tr. 37-38), and unsuccessful \nefforts to make contact with SOR creditor \u00b6 1.i (Tr. 37-38 and 41-42) \nApplicant\u2019s divorce and resulting single-parent responsibilities have been difficult \nand costly for him. While drug tests administered to his ex-wife produced negative \nresults for marijuana and other illegal drugs (AE E), his ex-wife has been unable to meet \nall of her child support payment obligations due to periods of unemployment. (Tr. 42) \nWhen able, she contributes $900 a month for child support and splits the monthly costs \nof medication for their children.

(AE J) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n \n \n  Financial Considerations \n   The Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \n Burdens of Proof\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s reported accumulation of five \ndelinquent DoE student loans (exceeding $35,000) that he originated to finance his \nundergraduate and graduate education. Additional security concerns are raised over \ndelinquent consumer debts (exceeding $2,900). Applicant\u2019s debt delinquencies warrant \nthe application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration \nguidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited extenuating circumstances associated with his single-parenting \nresponsibilities contributed materially to his delays in addressing his matured student \nloans in 2018. Applicant has since been approved for rehabilitation of his student loans \nand is on schedule to make his first scheduled payments once the federal pause is \nlifted. While Applicant\u2019s remaining four SOR-listed debts (all consumer-related) \nexceeding $2,900) have not all been resolved, one of them (SOR \u00b6 1.h) is covered by a \nrepayment plan and is favorably resolved. Applicant could not identify the remaining \nthree consumer debts as debts belonging to him. Totaling no more than $1,900, these \nthree debts are favorably resolved as well. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n                                 \n \n \nApplicable mitigating conditions (MC) include MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual \ninitiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.\u201d \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts.

Applicant is credited \nwith making considerable progress in resolving his debts. \nConsidered together, Applicant has shown sufficient responsibility in managing \nhis finances to enable him to maintain sufficient control of his finances to meet minimum \nstandards for holding a security clearance. Extenuating and mitigating credit are \nconsiderable in Applicant\u2019s case. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec.

After considering all the evidence, including \nApplicant\u2019s age, education, experience, admissions, inconsistent responses, and the \nillogical rationale for the incorrect information on the 2021 SF 86, I find by substantial \nevidence that he intentionally provided false information on the 2021 SF 86, as \ndiscussed further in the analysis. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant had a relationship with Ms. A, a citizen and resident of Ethiopia, a \ncountry with political instability, terrorism, and human rights problems. That relationship \nraised security concerns when it was ongoing, but it ended in about 2017. It does not \ngenerate any current security concerns or establish any disqualifying conditions. SOR \u00b6 \n1.a is concluded for Applicant.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is friends with Ms. B, a citizen of Ethiopia, who currently resides in \nSpain. That is enough to create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Ms. B and Ethiopia. He is not \nromantically involved with Ms. B, and he has not returned to Ethiopia since he broke up \nwith Ms. A in about 2017. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Ms. B and Ethiopia are outweighed by his deep and \nlong-standing relationships and loyalties in the United States. It is unlikely he will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of the United States and \nthe interests of Ethiopia. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are \napplicable. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a   \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant intentionally failed to report that he had \u201cclose \nand/or continuing\u201d contact with foreign nationals Ms. A and Ms. B on his 2021 SF 86. \nThe question is straightforward, and Applicant\u2019s explanation that he did not think a \nfriend could be a foreign national is nonsensical. I find that he intentionally did not report \nMs. A, who was his girlfriend for several years. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable for his failure to \nreport Ms. A. However, he was never romantically involved with Ms. B. I am not \nconvinced that he was aware that he had to report her. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable for \nhis failure to report Ms. B. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b   \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant intentionally failed to report on his 2021 SF 86 \nthat he provided financial support to Ms. A, a foreign national. He admitted that what he \nsent her amounted to support, but his argument that he did not think a friend could be a \nforeign national strains credulity. I find that he intentionally did not report his support to \nMs. A. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c   \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant intentionally failed to report on his 2021 SF 86 \nhis foreign travel, including at least three trips to Ethiopia and a trip to India. The SF 86 \nwas replete with mistakes and incorrect information. As indicated above, I found that \nsome of the incorrect information was due to intentional falsification. Other incorrect \ninformation can be attributed to inattention to detail, slack attitude, inability to \ncomprehend the question, or just a mistake. This is one of the incorrect answers that I \nam attributing to a reason other than intentional falsification. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not \napplicable. SOR \u00b6 2.c is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant discussed his relationship with Ms. A and his travels to Ethiopia and \nIndia during his background interview in July 2021. He indicated that he did not report \nhis foreign travel because he forgot about it, and he thought all his foreign travel was for \ngovernment business. In his SOR response and hearing testimony, he asserted that he \ndid not list Ms. A and Ms. B because he did not consider them to be foreign nationals. \nApplicant denied that he lied on the 2021 SF 86. Having determined that he intentionally \nomitted information about his foreign contacts in an attempt to mislead the government, \nI have also determined that his explanations that the omissions were unintentional were \nalso false. It would be inconsistent to find his conduct mitigated.2 \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n2 See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance: \nOnce the Administrative Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified a security \nclearance application in September 2002, the Judge could not render a favorable security \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B and E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s work overseas for defense contractors. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns, but he did not mitigate the personal \nconduct security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except as it \nrelates to Ms. B, which is found \nFor Applicant) \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Her admission \nis incorporated into the findings of fact. (Item 2) After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old and is a high school graduate. She is unmarried but has \ncohabitated with a person periodically since 2008. She has four children, ages 18, 15, 12, \nand 9 years old. In June 2022, she started a position with her current employer, a defense \ncontractor, and she submitted a security clearance application (SCA) for the first time. \n(Item 3) \nIn her SCA, Applicant reported that prior to this position, she had been unemployed \nsince February 2022. Before that, she worked for two insurance agencies from \nSeptember 2016 to September 2021. (Item 2) \nIn September 2022, the Government sent Applicant a set of financial interrogatories \nand inquired about a delinquent account owed to a bank in the amount of $22,167 for a \npersonal loan. According to her July 2022 credit bureau report (CBR), she took out the \nloan in July 2018 for $35,000. It went into collection in May 2022 with a balance of \n$22,167. (Item 5 at 2) \nIn response to those interrogatories, Applicant stated that in 2020, her work hours \nwere decreased, which caused her financial problems. (Item 4) She also included a copy \nof her monthly budget that stated her net pay was $2,904, her expenses were $1,674, \nand payments on other debts were $1,219, leaving $11 remaining at the end of the month. \nShe was making payments on eight credit cards, which had a combined balance of \n$22,317, and a $214,000 mortgage. She noted that her partner does contribute to some \nexpenses. (Item 4 at 9) \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admission and the July 2022 CBR, the SOR alleged the \n$22,167 delinquent personal loan. Applicant acknowledged that she had been unable to \npay the debt because of a lack of money and stated that she has not heard from the \ncreditor since 2020. She claimed the creditor refused to work out a payment plan. She \nintends to establish a plan if she obtains a security clearance. (Item 7) \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be \nused in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise security concerns. Two may be \npotentially disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a debt from 2020 that she has been unable to resolve. The evidence \nraises the above security concerns, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, \nextenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising under \nthis guideline. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above \nmitigating conditions. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt has been outstanding since 2020 and \nthere is no evidence that she has contacted the creditor since then. It continues to be \nunresolved, casting doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant \nattributed her delinquent debt to a period in 2020 when her work hours were decreased. \nThose were circumstances beyond her control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. She did not provide \nevidence to demonstrate that she attempted to responsibly manage or resolve her debt \nsince 2020. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant did not provide evidence that she participated in financial counseling. \nThere is insufficient evidence from which to conclude that her delinquent debt is under or \ncoming under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. There is no evidence that she \ncommunicated with the creditor or tried to establish a plan to resolve the debt, despite \nreceiving the SOR in November 2022. After being notified of the Government\u2019s concerns \nin the December 2022 FORM, she did not submit evidence of an attempt to resolve the \nmatter with the creditor. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n                                     \n \n \n \n  \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in view of all facts and circumstances surrounding \nthis case. To date, Applicant has not taken action to resolve her large personal loan that \nis delinquent and in collection. She has not established a track record of responsible \nfinancial management. Applicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph: 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering all circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Under \nthese circumstances, her application for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 9, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Services (CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, \nexplaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to grant security her clearance eligibility. The CAS took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any \nadjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. \nOn January 9, 2023, Applicant answered the SOR.

The FORM contained \nseven attachments, identified as Item 1 through Item 7. \nApplicant received a copy of the FORM on February 1, 2023. She was given 30 \ndays to file a response. Applicant did not file a response, whereupon the case was \nassigned to me on June 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 34 years old and unmarried. She graduated from high school in 2010 \nand attended college from 2015 to 2017. (Item 1 at 12) She did not graduate from college. \nApplicant has been working as a senior security analyst for the federal contractor \nsponsoring her clearance since June 2021. (Item 2 at 12) \nThe SOR alleges 15 collection accounts totaling $37,049. Thirteen of the accounts \nare federal student loans. By January 2023, Applicant had brought six of the accounts, \nas alleged in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k, into current status with \npayments made after the issuance of the SOR. (Item 2 at 4-9) The amount of these \npayments are unknown from the record. As for the remaining debts, she contends that \nshe is working with the creditors set forth in subparagraphs 1.b through 1.d, 1.f, and 1.h \nto lower the loan balances, and she is paying down the debts alleged in subparagraphs \n1.l through 1.o. (Item 2 at 4-9) She did not support her contentions with substantiating \nevidence. \nApplicant was unemployed from December 2019 to May 2020. (Item 7 at 2) During \nthis time, she supported herself with savings. (Item 7 at 2) In May of 2021, she submitted \na budget as part of the investigative process, in which she reported approximately $2,780 \nof monthly discretionary income. (Item 7 at 6) She did not proffer information about her \nrelevant income or expenses prior to May 2021, nor did she indicate the reason that she \ndid not make any payments toward her delinquent debts before December 2019 or \nbetween May 2021 and January 2023. During an investigative interview in October 2021, \nshe contended that she retained a credit repair agency to help her resolve the delinquent \nstudent loans. (Item 7 at 5) However, she did not support her contention with a copy of \nthe retainer agreement, or otherwise establish which debts that the credit repair agency \nhas been helping her to resolve, or the status of any progress made toward resolving \nthem. Moreover, Applicant did not respond to the FORM, so she did not provide any \nupdated information about her debts or her finances. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno on-e has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n18) Applicant\u2019s multiple outstanding student loan accounts trigger the application of AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d   \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant was unemployed for six months between December 2019 and May 2020. \nHowever, she did not establish that her unemployment was beyond her control, or that \nthe savings she accessed during her period of unemployment were insufficient to meet \nher expenses. Consequently, I am unable to conclude that her delinquent debts are \nattributable largely to her period of unemployment or that she acted reasonably to address \nher delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant stated that she was working with a credit repair company. However, she \nprovided no proof of any agreement, nor any evidence of a payment plan that this credit \nrepair company assisted her with. Under these circumstances, the first prong of AG \u00b6 \n20(c) applies, but it has minimal probative value. \nAfter receiving the SOR, Applicant made payments to get the student loans alleged \nin subparagraphs 1.a, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k out of delinquent status. I resolve these \ndebts in her favor. Although the record indicates that these debts are out of delinquent \nstatus, there is no record evidence of how much Applicant paid to get them out of \ndelinquent status. Moreover, despite having $2,780 of monthly discretionary income since \nat least May 2021, Applicant did not begin making these delinquent debt payments until \nafter the issuance of the SOR. Consequently, I cannot conclude that AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \nIn sum, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n. \nWhole-Person Concept \nAbsent more concrete evidence of debt rehabilitation, I cannot conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are under control and unlikely to recur.

In a September \n2022 Personal Financial Statement, he claimed that he has about $3,600 in surplus \nincome each month, and that he will have an additional $600-per-month once his child \nsupport ended in May 2023. This surplus includes his monthly take-home income of \nabout $4,000 that he started earning by August 2022, at the latest. He provided no \nevidence that he has undergone financial counseling but has hired at least two \ncompanies to help him improve his credit score. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, \nso more recent information about his finances is not available.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had two delinquent debts totaling about $29,000, that were delinquent \nfor several years. The above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAs he has not meaningfully addressed the far more significant debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by circumstances beyond his control. \nHowever, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, he must also show that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. He has not. According to his September 2022 Personal Financial \nStatement, he has a monthly surplus of about $3,600. This surplus is based upon \nwages that he has earned since August 2022, at the latest. Despite this surplus, he has \nnot provided evidence of any action to resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, save having a \ncompany send a dispute letter to the creditor that offers no basis for his dispute. He \nmade a payment arrangement for the significantly lesser debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b months after \nbeing placed on notice that his security clearance was in jeopardy. An applicant who \nbegins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or \nher clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and \nregulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). For these reasons, AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 \n20(d) do not apply. \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant is receiving financial counseling from \na legitimate and credible source. At most, the evidence shows that he has engaged a \ncompany whose goal it is to have accounts removed from his credit report. Furthermore, \nby his failure to meaningfully address the far more substantial debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, he \nfails to show that the problem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. \nApplicant did not provide a basis (reasonable or otherwise) to dispute either of \nthe SOR debts. Available evidence shows the dispute letter to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a \ndid not provide a basis for a dispute. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. He failed to provide \nsufficient evidence that any of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Item 4 at 5, 8)  \nIn March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President directed the \nDepartment of Education (DoEd) to provide the following temporary relief on DoEd-owned \nfederal student loans: suspension of loan payments, stopped collections on defaulted \nloans, and a 0% interest rate. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and \nEconomic Security Act (CARES Act) provided for the above relief measures through \nSeptember 30, 2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, ISCR Case No. 20-02787 \nat 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 2022) This student loan debt relief has been extended several \ntimes. See https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,\nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

It encompasses concerns about a \nperson's self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are established by the evidence: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19 (b) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. The SOR alleged four delinquent \nconsumer accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.i. \u2013 1.k) and seven delinquent federal student loans \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d and 1.f \u2013 1.h), a total approximate balance of $21,742, which were \nassigned for collection between 2015 to 2016. \nA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the \nprotection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information. See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, \n2015). While her student loans may be considered in a deferred status since March 2020 \nbecause of the COVID-19 deferment, that action does not excuse previously delinquent \nstudent loans that have been delinquent for several years. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 \nat 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raise security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the Government.

The following mitigating \nconditions potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  Applicant\u2019s financial issues are ongoing, and she has \nnot provided proof that she has taken steps to rehabilitate her delinquent student loans. \nHer student loans became delinquent well before the COVID relief moratorium took effect. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. While Applicant\u2019s single-motherhood of three \nchildren caused financial problems, I cannot conclude she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances because she has not provided documentary evidence of her attempts to \nrehabilitate her delinquent student loans nor evidence of the disputed debt owed to her \nformer landlord. Applicant\u2019s lack of action towards resolving her delinquent student loan \ndebts prior to any COVID relief options shows that she has not acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, \n2021) addressed this factual situation noting in that case \u201cthe Judge addressed this issue \nby concluding that, while the President\u2019s action effectively places Applicant\u2019s student \nloans in a deferment status, \u201cit does not excuse Applicant\u2019s past inactions in the context \nof security clearance eligibility.\u201d Decision at 9. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established with regard to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i -1.k. \nApplicant provided documentary evidence that these three debts are resolved. AG \u00b6 20(d) \ndoes not apply with regard to Applicant\u2019s delinquent student loans or the debt owed to the \nlandlord as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant states she intends to consolidate all of her \ndelinquent student loans, no documentation showing her attempts to rehabilitate the \ndelinquent student loans was provided. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) potentially applies regarding Applicant\u2019s dispute of the $2,750 debt \nowed to her former landlord (SOR \u00b6 1.e). However, she did not provide documented proof \nsubstantiating the basis of the dispute or evidence of the actions she has taken to resolve \nthe dispute. This mitigating condition does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s employment with the same DoD contractor since 2009. I \nconsidered that she raised three children as a single mother. I considered that Applicant \nresolved the three consumer debts alleged in the SOR. The major concern in this case is \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent student loan accounts which have remained delinquent since 2015 \nand 2016. While Applicant claimed she was in the process of resolving or rehabilitating \nthe delinquent student loans, she provided no documentation of the steps taken so far to \nachieve this goal. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i \u2013 1.k: \n \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.

May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence admitted into evidence \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s student loans were delinquent in 2017. \nThere is some evidence there had been payments in the 2019 time period and then during \nthe COVID 19 period there was no activity. When he was notified the payment pause \nwould end in September 2023 and payments would resume on October 1, 2023, he \ndocumented he was enrolled in a payment plan. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant established he was responsibly \npaying his rent and his roommate wrongfully appropriated his payments. The matter is an \nongoing dispute and potential criminal matter against his former roommate. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.k. Applicant has established a payment \nplan which he can meet and documented his recent efforts \nto resume his student loan \npayments. \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired. Under the limited circumstances of this case, I find that his finances no longer \ngenerate questions about his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Security concerns about his finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                               \n \n \n          \n                    \n                         \n \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Applicant experienced a prior arrest related to his use of alcohol. In 2015, he \nand his then-girlfriend went to a bar. Applicant believes that someone added a drug to his \ndrink. He wrote in the Answer that a friend accompanied him and his former girlfriend, \nand the friend also believed he was drugged. Applicant has no memory of the events of \nthe evening. He believes his female companion was the actual target of the drug incident. \nHe claims that he subsequently learned that he went to a second bar where he had an \naltercation with the bar\u2019s bouncer. He was arrested and charged with Drunk in Public. He \nhired a lawyer, and the charge was dropped. Applicant submitted no corroborating \ntestimony regarding his claim that he was drugged, such as a written statement from the \nfriend who accompanied him to the first bar. (Tr. at 16-18, 35, 47; AE J at 2.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 2 are as follows: \n2.a. After having been granted access to classified information during 2011, \nApplicant attended two concerts with a friend. The friend gave him MDMA (Ecstasy) \nduring both concerts, which occurred in or about December 2014 and October 2015. \nApplicant took the illegal drug knowing that to do so was inconsistent with his \nresponsibilities and commitments as a person granted access to classified information. \nHe asserted at the hearing that these were just two instances of poor judgment. (Tr. at \n18-19, 46.) \n2.b. Beginning in high school and extending through his college years and his post-\ngraduate education when he worked at a DoD facility, Applicant used marijuana. He\nclaims that his use during the period of 2010 to 2015 was limited to four occasions. (Tr.\nat 19-21; AE G.)  \n \n \nThe record contains his 2011 security clearance application in which he wrote that \nhis last use was in 2007 when he was in high school. He asserted, \u201cI was young and I \nhave no desire to use it again.\u201d He was granted a clearance. In his 2021 e-QIP, he \ncontradicted his disclosure in his 2011 security clearance application, that his last use of \nmarijuana was in 2007, by disclosing that his first use during the relevant time period was \nin May 2010. He partially blamed his former girlfriend for his poor judgment in using illegal \ndrugs. His current girlfriend uses marijuana on a regular basis for medical purposes. \nApplicant denied that her use of marijuana has any effect on his abstinence. He repeated \nhis 2011 statement regarding his intent not to use marijuana in the future by writing, \u201cI \nhave no desire to partake in these activities now or in the future.\u201d (GE 1 at 36-37; GE 2 \nat 35.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government does not allege in the SOR another government agency\u2019s (AGA) \ndenial of Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility.

The Government cross-alleges the two alcohol-related offenses under \nGuideline J under the guideline for Alcohol Consumption. \n3.b. The SOR further alleges that Applicant continues to consume alcohol despite \nhis two alcohol-related arrests and his completion of a three-month alcohol education and \nawareness program, which was required pursuant to his DUI sentence. Applicant asserts \nthat he drinks much less following his 2021 DUI arrest. He claims he now only drinks a \ncouple times a week at dinner on weekends. He acknowledged that he sometimes drinks \nto the point of intoxication and has blacked out in the past, though not more than once a \nyear. He last drank excessively in the summer of 2021 at a friend\u2019s birthday party. (Tr. at \n25-26; 38-39.) \nParagraph 4 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 4 are as follows: \n4.a. The Government cross-alleges the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, \n2.a, 2.b, and 3.b under Personal Conduct guideline. \nMitigation \nApplicant provided extensive evidence in mitigation of the security concerns raised \nby his conduct as detailed above. I have thoroughly reviewed all of the evidence, and it \nis unnecessary to describe it at length. In summary, he has provided written statements \nof intent to not repeat his past misuse of alcohol and illegal drugs. He has provided \nevidence of alcohol and drug tests taken to show that, on the days he was tested and for \nperiods preceding the tests, he had not used alcohol or illegal drugs. He submitted \nevidence of awards, bonuses, and favorable performance evaluations he has received \nfrom his employer. He provided copies of his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees and his \ndriver\u2019s license. Applicant\u2019s evidence includes five reference letters in which the authors \npraise Applicant\u2019s many admirable qualities and good character. (AE A through R.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes five conditions that could raise security concerns under this \nguideline. The following condition is potentially applicable in this case and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nApplicant\u2019s two alcohol-related arrests establish the above potentially disqualifying \ncondition and shift the burden to Appellant to mitigate security concerns. AG \u00b6 32 sets \nforth four mitigating conditions under Guideline J. The following two mitigating conditions \nhave possible application in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a) has not been established. With respect to Applicant\u2019s \n2015 arrest for Drunk in Public, Applicant testified about his belief as to what happened \nthat night, i.e., that a stranger put an incapacitating drug in his drink. Under the \ncircumstances presented by the evidence in this case, an alternative explanation for \nApplicant\u2019s subsequent arrest is that he drank excessively that night and became unruly. \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient credible evidence to meet his burden of proof that the \ncircumstances of his arrest were \u201cunusual\u201d and unlikely to recur. In fact, his excessive \ndrinking did recur in 2021, and he was again arrested and charged with DUI. His BAC at \nthat time was almost double the minimum amount required to establish the offense of \nDUI. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 32(d) is only partially established. Applicant provided \nevidence of successful rehabilitation in the form of his excellent employment record and \nsolid character references. He also fully complied with the terms of his DUI sentence, \nthough he remains on probation with the state DMV and his license is subject to \nrevocation until 2025. Applicant continues to drink alcohol, however, raising the possibility \nof further criminal involvement due to his drinking. Insufficient time has passed since his \nAugust 2021 DUI arrest to warrant a conclusion that he can drink alcohol responsibly \nwithout the recurrence of criminal activity. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.      \nAG \u00b6 25 describes seven conditions that could raise security concerns. The \nfollowing conditions are potentially applicable in this case and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony regarding his history of drug use after having been granted \naccess to classified information establishes the above disqualifying conditions and shifts \nthe burden to him to mitigate the security concerns raised by his conduct. The guideline \nincludes the following two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited \nto: \n(1) dissociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant has only partially established the above mitigating conditions. His last \nuse of an illegal drug occurred several years ago and is unlikely to recur. He has \nacknowledged his drug involvement, has established a pattern of abstinence, and has \ntaken the steps above. His current girlfriend\u2019s use of marijuana for medicinal purposes \nraises some concerns but is not determinative. Applicant\u2019s repeated and deliberate use \nof illegal drugs while granted access to a security clearance, however, reveals a lack of \nmaturity and reliability that casts doubt on his current trustworthiness and good judgment. \nParagraph 2 is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes seven conditions that could raise security concerns. The \nfollowing conditions are potentially applicable in this case and may be disqualifying: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s two alcohol-related arrests establish AG \u00b6 22(a) and his admission that \nhe continues to drink alcohol excessively, though less frequently than in the past, \nestablishes AG \u00b6 22(c). This shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate the security \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerns raised by his conduct. AG \u00b6 23 sets forth the following four mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline G: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have been established. Applicant\u2019s abuse \nof alcohol casts doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nHe claims that he has modified his drinking habits, but he provided no evidence that his \nreduced consumption is in accordance with treatment recommendations. He is not \nparticipating in counseling or a treatment program and has not completed a treatment \nprogram. His last arrest for DUI was too recent to permit a conclusion that he has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption. Paragraph 3 is \nresolved against Applicant. \nParagraph 4 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes seven conditions that could raise security concerns. The \nfollowing condition is potentially applicable in this case and may be disqualifying: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information.  \nTo the extent that any of the above adverse determinations under other guidelines \nis insufficiently supported, the record evidence, when considered in its entirety supports \na whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nand unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 16(c) is established. AG \u00b6 \n17 sets forth the following two mitigating conditions under Guideline E that have possible \napplication to the facts in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nNeither of the above mitigating conditions has been established. The series of poor \njudgments made by Applicant over a number of years, up to and including 2021, casts \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Moreover, he has not fully \nrecognized his problematic behavior or obtained counseling to change his behavior. He \ncontinues to drink alcohol without the benefit of any significant counseling, other than a \nstandard three-month education and awareness course ordered by the sentencing judge \nin connection with Applicant\u2019s DUI offense. A repetition of the 2021 DUI offense is not \nunlikely since Applicant continues to drink alcohol, sometimes to excess. Also, Applicant \ndid not believe then or today that he was under the influence of alcohol before he \nattempted to drive home when he was arrested with a BAC of 0.15%. His judgment with \nrespect to his alcohol consumption lacks maturity and reliability.

The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines \nJ, H, G, and E in my whole-person analysis. I have weighed Applicant\u2019s abstinence from \nillegal drugs and his claim that he has reduced his alcohol consumption. I have also \nconsidered his impressive employment record and the comments of his character \nreferences. However, Applicant has acted immaturely and irresponsibly for a number of \nyears, and as recently as August 2021. He has broken past promises of abstinence from \ndrugs, which undercuts the mitigation value of his current promises not to use illegal drugs \nand avoid drinking and driving. This pattern of behavior is inconsistent with the maturity \nand reliability required of a person granted access to classified information. Moreover, he \nhas failed to provide sufficient evidence of actions taken to avoid future unreliable conduct \nor to mitigate the evidence of his poor judgment.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 32-year-old welder employed by a defense contractor since April 2018. He has worked as a welder for various contractors since November 2009, with periods of unemployment between contracts. He received a certificate in welding from a technical school in September 2013. He attended a community college for about three months in 2016 but did not receive a degree. He married in March 2023 and has no children. (Tr. 20). He has never held a security clearance. The SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.o) and failure to file a federal income tax return for tax year 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The delinquent debts are reflected in credit reports from June 2021, June 2022, and March 2023. (GX 4, 5, and 6) The evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.

I held the record open until November 10, 2023, to enable him \nto submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX F through U, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 6, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR.

He has never held a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.o) and failure to file a federal \nincome tax return for tax year 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The delinquent debts are reflected in \ncredit reports from June 2021, June 2022, and March 2023.

(Tr. 21) All of the loans were \ndelinquent before the COVID-19 deferment of collections because of Applicant\u2019s erratic \nemployment, which consisted of multiple short-term, low-paying jobs. (Tr. 30) In October \n2023, Applicant was approved for the Fresh Start program, and the loans were taken out \nof default status and transferred to a loan servicer.

Applicant \nadmitted that he failed to file his federal returns for 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. He filed \nall the past-due returns in February 2023. He estimated that he owes about $40,000 in \nfederal taxes. (Tr. 43-45) He submitted evidence that he had a payment agreement with \nthe IRS to pay $390 per month by direct debit. (AX E) He submitted bank records showing \nthat he had made the agreed payments in July, August, September, and October 2023. \n(AX R, S, T, and U) \nApplicant admitted that he was indebted to two insurance companies and had \ntaken no action to resolve these debts, which were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 47-48) \nAfter the hearing, he submitted evidence that he had resolved both debts. (AX I) I have \nconsidered the evidence of these unalleged debts for the limited purpose of evaluating \nhis evidence of mitigation and in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant submitted evidence that he has engaged a credit-repair company to \nassist him.

He also submitted evidence of a payment to a medical group not alleged in the SOR \n(AX N) and payments to several creditors not alleged in the SOR. (AX I through M) \nIn June 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery on a \nfamily member, abduction by force and intimidation, strangling or wounding causing \ninjury, and destruction of property of a value less than $1,000. The incident occurred when \nApplicant decided to leave a cohabitant. His cohabitant did not want him to leave, and \nshe started hitting him. No injuries were inflicted.

(AX A, B, and C) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s frequent and unpredictable periods of \nunemployment were conditions largely beyond his control. Because there is no evidence \nin the record of the circumstances that resulted in his medical debts, I cannot determine \nif they were conditions largely beyond his control. In any event, he has not acted \nresponsibly. He submitted no evidence of responsible conduct until he realized that his \ndebts were an impediment to a security clearance. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. The credit-repair company does not provide the type \nof financial counseling contemplated by this mitigating condition. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established.

ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing \nISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017). Applicant has a payment plan for \nhis delinquent student loans, but they were delinquent well before the COVID-19 \nforbearance went into effect. Accordingly, there is a concern that Appellant will not make \npayments on his student loans now that they are no longer in forbearance. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established. Applicant has filed his past-due tax returns, established \na payment plan for the tax debt, and has complied with his payment agreement. However, \nthe fact that Applicant has filed his past-due returns does not preclude careful \nconsideration of his security worthiness based on longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility. ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). A security clearance \nadjudication is not directed at collecting debts, nor is it directed toward inducing an \napplicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). A person \nwho fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high \ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nThe SOR originally alleged eight instances of criminal conduct. However, seven of \nthe eight allegations were withdrawn by department counsel. The one remaining \nallegation was resolved by Applicant\u2019s plea of guilty to destroying a cellphone during a \ndomestic altercation with a former cohabitant. The evidence is sufficient to establish the \ndisqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 31(b): \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible \nallegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nBoth mitigating conditions are established. Although serious charges were filed \nagainst Applicant after his altercation with a former cohabitant, the evidence shows that it \nwas a mutual altercation initiated by a former cohabitant, in which no one was injured. The \nincident was more than four years ago. Applicant is no longer involved with that cohabitant, \nand there is no evidence that he has been involved in any criminal activity since June \n2019. He is currently in a stable relationship with another cohabitant. The testimonials of \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor indicate that he is a trustworthy person. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and J in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After years of unsteady \nemployment, Applicant has apparently gained control of his life. However, this is a case \nof \u201ctoo little\u201d and \u201ctoo late.\u201d He appears to have finally realized the need to gain control of \nhis finances, but he has not established a track record of financial responsibility. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and J, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct, but he has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and failure to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.h: \nWithdrawn \nParagraph 3, Guideline H (Drug Involvement) \nWITHDRAWN \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 19, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines B, D, E, \nand J. Applicant responded to the SOR on January 23, 2023, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 11, 2023. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled on August 14, 2023. \n1 \n\nEvidentiary Rulings \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence over \nApplicant\u2019s objection.

(Hearing Exhibit (HE) I) Without objection, I have taken administrative \nnotice of the facts contained in the request. The pertinent facts are summarized in the \nwritten request and will not be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of note, Turkey is a \nconstitutional republic with an executive presidential system and a unicameral \nparliament.

(Tr. at 39-\n42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \n2 \n\n \nApplicant visits his family in Turkey about once a year for about ten days to two \nweeks. He contacts them by telephone or electronic means almost every day. They own \nan apartment in Turkey. He sends them about $2,500 a month in support. (Tr. at 36-38; \nGE 1, 2) \nApplicant was stationed in Germany from 2011 to 2013. On numerous occasions, \nhe entered the women\u2019s locker room at a gym on a NATO base, went into the gym bags \nor lockers of about 27 women, and stole their underwear. He was caught when a \nwoman placed a hidden camera in her gym bag. (Tr. at 24, 53-57; Applicant\u2019s response \nto SOR; GE 3) \nApplicant was punished under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice \n(UCMJ) in May 2013 for larceny of four pairs of underwear from a German female, one \npair of underwear from another German female, two pairs of underwear from a British \nfemale, and two pairs of underwear from a Dutch female. He was reduced a pay grade \nto E-6, ordered to forfeit $1,000 per month for two months, and reprimanded. (Tr. at 23, \n55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4) \nApplicant stated that he did not know why he took the underwear, but it was not \nfor his sexual gratification. He has never received counseling to delve into the roots of \nwhy he did so. He is ashamed of the conduct, and he has never informed his wife, his \nfamily, or his friends about it. He stated that he has not stolen underwear since he was \ncaught. (Tr. at 55-57) \nApplicant worked for a company from 2014 to 2018. He resigned in lieu of \ntermination after he was caught cheating on a certification examination when he brought \nnotes into the test center. He stated that he forgot the expiration date of the certification, \nand he did not have time to prepare for the test. He admitted that it was a poor decision, \nbut it was the only occasion he had ever cheated.

The women were not prostitutes, \nand there was no money exchanged. It was consensual activities with adult women that \nhe met \u201c[a]t a bar or on the street or restaurant or museum, wherever.\u201d He did not have \nany ongoing contact with the women after the sex. He informed his wife about the sex \nwith the foreign women about one to two years ago. She was not happy, but she \nforgave him. (Tr. at 42-50, 66; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant admitted that he made poor decisions, but he stated that he learned \nfrom his mistakes, and none of the conduct will be repeated. He asserted that his \nbehavior has never affected his ability to protect classified information, and that he will \nnever allow his conduct to be used to extort or coerce him into divulging classified \ninformation.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s wife and her parents are citizens and residents of Turkey. His child is \na U.S. citizen living in Turkey with Applicant\u2019s wife. Turkey is a constitutional republic \nand a key NATO ally, but there is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human \nrights problems in Turkey. \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \n5 \n\n \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s family in Turkey creates a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence. \nApplicant\u2019s extramarital sexual relationships with multiple foreign women in \nBulgaria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Thailand created a potential conflict of \ninterest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6 7(a) is applicable to those relationships. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nApplicant has not had any ongoing contact with the foreign women after the \nsexual encounters. He informed his wife about the sex with the foreign women about \none to two years ago. She was not happy, but she forgave him. There are no current \nforeign influence concerns generated by those contacts. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Turkey. There is nothing in the \nadministrative notice documents to indicate that Turkey would use coercive measures \nagainst Applicant\u2019s family to obtain classified information. There is terrorism in Turkey, \nas there is in multiple countries, including the United States. \nApplicant served in the U.S. military for 20 years. I find that his ties to Turkey are \noutweighed by his deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates. It is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of the United States and the interests of Turkey. There is no conflict of interest, \nbecause he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United \nStates. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are applicable. \n6 \n\n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \nThe SOR cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s extramarital sexual relationships with multiple \nforeign women in Bulgaria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Thailand. That conduct \nreflected a lack of judgment and made him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, and \nduress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(c) and 13(d) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is aware of his affairs. She was not happy, but she forgave him. \nSexual behavior security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n7 \n\n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant entered the women\u2019s locker room at the gym on a NATO base, went \ninto their gym bags or lockers, and stole the underwear from about 27 women. AG \u00b6 \n31(b) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIt has been more than ten years since Applicant stole the women\u2019s underwear. \nHe stated that he did not know why he took the underwear, but it was not for his sexual \ngratification. That statement is difficult to accept at face value, because why else would \na man subject himself to so many legal and other repercussions to steal women\u2019s \nunderwear. He has never received counseling to delve into the roots of why he did so. \nHe is ashamed of the conduct, and he has never informed his wife, his family, or his \nfriends about it. \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s lack of insight into his conduct, I am unable to conclude \nthat it is unlikely to recur. His criminal conduct continues to make him vulnerable to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress; and it casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n \n \n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \ntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, willingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \nand \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s resignation in lieu of termination after he was \ncaught cheating on a certification examination. It cross-alleges his theft of women\u2019s \nunderwear and his extramarital sexual relationships with multiple foreign women. His \nconduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable to the theft of underwear and the \nextramarital affairs. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are applicable to the cheating on a \ncertification examination. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nThe discussion above under Guidelines B, D, and J is incorporated here. \nApplicant was involved in multiple incidents of poor judgment and criminal conduct. I am \nunable to conclude that it is unlikely to recur. His conduct continues to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are not \napplicable. AG \u00b6 17(e) is applicable to the extramarital affairs. It is not applicable to the \nother conduct. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated despite the \npresence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B, D, E, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s military service and his work for defense contractors. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \n10 \n\n________________________ \nmitigated the security concerns under Guidelines B and D, but he did not mitigate \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines E and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline D: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

On \nNovember 18, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The DCSA CAF \nacted under Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn January 24, 2023, Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR (Answer) and \nelected a decision on the written record by an administrative judge of the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).

DOHA sent Applicant the FORM on March 2, 2023, and she received \nit on March 20, 2023. She was afforded 30 days after receiving the FORM to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not \nrespond or object to the FORM. The SOR and the Answer are the pleadings in the case. \n(Items 1 and 3, respectively.)

Applicant was also \nnotified that if she did not raise an objection to Item 5 in her response to the FORM, or if \nshe did not respond to the FORM, she could be considered to have waived any such \nobjection, and that Item 5 could be considered as evidence in her case. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 51 years old, never married, and has one son 12 years old.

She got her \ncurrent job and due to COVID-19 has been furloughed, but intended to get this taken care \nof,\u201d She has no agreement with the IRS and anticipates she will have filed by November \n2020 or after returning to work. (Item 5.) \nLaw and Policies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns under AG \n\u00b6 19. Applicant\u2019s failures to file federal and state income tax returns are established by \nher admissions. The following disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable in this \ncase: \n(f)  failure to file . . . annual Federal, state or local income tax returns . . .   \nas required. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., . . . unexpected medical emergency . . .), and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances); and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s failures to file \nincome tax returns began quite long ago, in 2014. They became, however, an annual \nfeature in her life. Those failures persist to this day. She has yet to do anything concrete \nto address those failures. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b). That mitigating condition has \ntwo requirements. First, the circumstances giving rise to the financial problems must be \n\u201clargely beyond\u201d an applicant\u2019s control. Second, the applicant must act responsibly in \naddressing those circumstances. Here, Applicant has faced problems caused by her then \nboyfriend who suffered from a mental disease. Having ended that relationship in August \n2018, not long after she was furloughed from her job by COVID-19. Before that, she was \nself-employed but only part-time. Those circumstances were largely beyond her control, \nthus satisfying the first requirement of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe next inquiry is whether Applicant acted responsibly when facing those adverse \ncircumstances. On this point, the record shows no efforts by her to even contact the taxing \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a and b.:  \n                            \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nauthorities about remedying her failures to file (and possibly to arrange to pay any \noverdue taxes). She has no agreement with the IRS or her state taxing authority. It is now \n2023. She failed to respond to the FORM by showing any attempts she might have made \nto contact the taxing authorities. Doing nothing in the face of years of unfiled income tax \nreturns is not responsible conduct contemplated by AG \u00b6 20(b). For the same reasoning, \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s failures to file federal and state income tax returns \nhave not been mitigated. \nI find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nWhole Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-\n(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person \nconcept in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \nApplicant leaves me with questions about her eligibility and suitability for a public \ntrust position. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. Eligibility for assignment to a public trust position is denied. \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

After \ngraduating, he moved into a house with three of his high school friends who also used \nmarijuana. He stayed in that home until 2008 and moved out shortly after his 21st \nbirthday. He stated that his marijuana use was at least weekly while living in the home \nwith his friends. From 2008 to about 2012, he moved back home to live with his parents \nand his 20-year-old-brother.

He used it out of loneliness and boredom. \nAt that time, he felt like he did not have any friends, and he did not like his current \ncareer path. He moved out of his parents\u2019 home in approximately 2012. (Tr. 21-32; GE \n1, 2) \nIn 2012, Applicant moved into a one-bedroom apartment by himself. He initially \nused marijuana, but he then met a girlfriend, and he felt his life changed in a positive \nmanner. He started to make goals about going to school, and he started socializing with \nfriends again. His use of marijuana decreased, and he was more productive with his \ntime.

(Tr. 32-36, 57) \nApplicant last used marijuana in March 2022, near the end of his senior year, \nduring a celebration at his parents\u2019 home. He was also busy applying for jobs, and he \ndecided that he no longer wanted marijuana to be a part of his life. After making his \ndecision, he informed his friends and family members that he no longer uses marijuana. \nHe was hired by a DOD contractor, and he understands how important it is to be placed \nin a position of trust and responsibility by his employer and the federal government. \nSince March 2022, he has not used marijuana or any other illegal drug, and he does not \nintend to use any illegal substances in the future. (Tr. 37-40; AE F; GE 1, 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged Applicant used mushrooms from February 2020 to August \n2021. Applicant testified that he used hallucinogenic mushrooms on two occasions, \nonce in February 2020 and the second time in August 2021. The first time he was on a \ncamping trip, his brother made tea with the mushrooms, and everyone drank the tea. \nThe second time Applicant and his girlfriend purchased mushrooms from a dispensary \nand used it together before saying their goodbyes as he left for his senior year in \ncollege. He has no interest or future intentions to use hallucinogenic mushrooms. (Tr. \n42-48, GE 1, 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged Applicant used opiates in 2012. He stated he used a \nprescription pill that is considered an opiate, but he actually took these pills with his \nfriends in 2007, not 2012. He used it on two or three occasions over the course of the \nyear. His friends provided the pills, and he did not like the nauseating effect from using \nthis drug. He has not used opiates since 2007, and he does not intend to use opiates in \nthe future. (Tr. 49-54; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged Applicant used cocaine in 2012.

He told the investigator that he had not used these drugs \u201cwithin the last ten \nyears,\u201d and he now believes that is how the date \u201c2012\u201d was calculated. He actually \nused cocaine on a few occasions in 2007 with these same friends, due to curiosity and \na desire to fit in with his friends. He never purchased cocaine.

(Tr. 54-57; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleged in November 2014 Applicant was arrested for (1) possession \nof 25 grams or less of marijuana and (2) possession of drug paraphernalia. He \nexplained that it was late at night, and he was pulled over by the police for having an \nexpired registration decal on his license plate. The police officer told Applicant he could \nsmell the odor of marijuana coming from his car. His car was searched, marijuana was \nfound, and Applicant was arrested. He was held at the police station for about an hour \nand released. He was given the option to plead guilty to count (1) and pay the fine in \nfull, which he did.

This incident was not found during his criminal background check, \nand he voluntarily provided this information during his July 2022 background interview. \nHis parents were having a verbal argument, and Applicant intervened and told his father \nthat he was being rude to his mother. The father said something to the effect that if you \nare so concerned about your mother, why don\u2019t you call the police? The father dialed \n911, they heard the dispatcher come on the line, and then his father disconnected the \nphone. The police arrived at the house, they searched Applicant\u2019s bedroom and found a \nsmall amount of marijuana, a pipe, and a grinder. They confiscated everything and gave \nApplicant a citation. Applicant appeared in court and was told that if chose the option to \npay the fine in full, he would not have to go through a hearing and this incident would \nnot be reported on his criminal record. He paid the fine in full. (Tr. 57-62) \nApplicant provided a drug specimen result certificate showing that in August \n2023, a drug test analysis of Applicant\u2019s hair did not detect the presence of marijuana, \ncocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine, opiates, or PCP. Applicant also provided a \nsigned statement of intent to refrain from using any and all illegal drugs, and any future \ninvolvement with drugs would be grounds for revocation of his security clearance. (AE \nE, L) \nParagraph 2 of the SOR alleged Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) security \nconcerns, and it cross-alleged SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. Applicant admitted both SOR \nallegations. He did not list his drug-related charges on the May 2022 SCA because he \nthought these offenses were limited to a seven-year period. He voluntarily disclosed \nboth incidents during his July 2022 background interview without the investigator \nconfronting him with this adverse information. (SOR response) \nFour witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Applicant also provided his work \nachievements, a current employer peer review, and numerous character reference \nletters from his college professors, co-workers, team manager, previous supervisor, \nfamily, and friends who described Applicant as an effective leader, honest, trustworthy, \nand intelligent. All of his colleagues had no reservations about Applicant\u2019s character, \nresponsibility, or patriotism. Applicant also submitted two awards from his employer - \n\u201crecognizing exceptional performance,\u201d and a positive employer peer review that was \ncompleted in November 2022.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used marijuana from September 2006 to March 2022, he used \nhallucinogenic mushrooms two times in 2020 and 2021, and he used both opiates and \ncocaine a few times in 2007. He was charged with drug-related offenses between 2009 \nand 2014. The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were being \nused;   \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant was completely candid about his illegal drug use on his May 2022 \nSCA. He understands marijuana use is against federal law, and it is unacceptable for \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividuals possessing DOD security clearances to smoke marijuana, even if the state \nlaw makes it legal to do so. He signed a letter of intent declaring his decision to not use \nany illegal drug in the future. I find he is sincere in his commitment to remain drug-free, \nand he is unlikely to resume his use of marijuana or any other illegal substance. He \nrecently graduated from college, matured, and is dedicated to his new career with a \nDOD contractor. He either stopped associating with individuals who use illegal drugs, or \nhe informed them of his wishes to remain abstinent. Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana \noccurred about 19 months ago and is unlikely to recur. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a) and 26(b)(1)(2) and (3) apply. Drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence show that Applicant was \ncharged in approximately 2009 and arrested in 2014 for possession of marijuana and \npossession of drug paraphernalia. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) are established. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher\neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity\ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence of rehabilitation and mitigation. He has an \nexcellent employment history with his employer, and he is considered by many \nassociates to be an effective leader, honest, and trustworthy. Given the passage of time \nsince he engaged in these criminal acts, I conclude that he is unlikely to engage in \ncriminal conduct in the future. His behavior no longer casts doubt on his current \nreliability and good judgment. Based on these facts, Applicant qualifies for mitigating \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a), (b), and (d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in \npersons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to grant or \ncontinue access to classified information, the government can consider facts and \ncircumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the person's judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance decisions are not limited \nto consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty hours. Even if an \napplicant has a good work record, his off duty conduct or circumstances can have \nsecurity significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's national \nsecurity eligibility. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana and other controlled substances occurred \npredominantly during his high school and college years. He has matured and he is \nremorseful about his past involvement with illegal drugs. He was forthright about his \ndrug-related offenses during his background interview, and he provided full details \nabout his illegal drug-use history on his May 2022 SCA. He has made positive changes \nin his life and is aware that future illegal drug use may jeopardize his career. Given the \nentirety of the record evidence, I conclude that Applicant mitigated the drug involvement \nand substance misuse and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

The security \nconcern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is a duplicate of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. When the \nsame conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative \nallegations should be resolved in the applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at \n3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have resolved SOR \n\u00b6 1.g in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe evidence reflects that Applicant made a recent payment on the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a and had substantially reduced the balance. He has settled the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f and is making payments under a payment agreement on the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He made single payments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, \nand 1.k, but he submitted no evidence of any payment agreements for those debts. They \nare unresolved. \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e and 1.h-1.k are unresolved and are \nsufficient to raise the two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.

While \nhe was unemployed in 2017, he acted responsibly by cashing in some investments. While \nhe was unemployed in 2020, he acted responsibly by redeeming his vehicle after it was \nrepossessed. He submitted no evidence of reasonable conduct regarding the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.k. \nThe record reflects a payment in February 2022 on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, \na payment in March 2023 on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, and payments in April 2023 \non the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.k. All these payments were made after Applicant \nsubmitted his SCA and realized that his debts were an impediment to obtaining a security \nclearance. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only \nunder pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicants who begin to address \ntheir security-significant conduct only when their personal interests are at stake may be \nlacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd.

However, despite his steady income, he has submitted no evidence of a \nreasonable plan for resolving the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.e and 1.h-1.k. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the \npoint of intoxication, from January 2013 to at least March 2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and that he \nwas charged with DUI in July 2010 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b). \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoth mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s DUI was in July 2010 and\nhas not recurred. He terminated his excessive alcohol consumption in March 2018. \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used inhalants with varying frequency from \nSeptember 2017 to about January 2020 (SOR \u00b6 3.a), used cocaine with varying frequency \nfrom July to November 2017 (SOR \u00b6 3.b), and used tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with \nvarying frequency from about August 2994 to November 2017 (SOR \u00b6 3.c). The security \nconcern under this guideline is set o ut in AG \u00b624: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) (\u201cany substance misuse (see above definition))\u201d; and AG \u00b6 25(c) (\u201cillegal \npossession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d). AG \u00b6 25(c) is not \napplicable to nitrous oxide (\u201claughing gas\u201d), because possessing it is not illegal. It is a \nmedication regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and is not authorized for \nrecreational purposes. It is frequently contained in pressurized containers, such as the \ncontainers of whipping cream used in this case. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is established. Applicant purchased cocaine one time in July 2020, \nafter he began working for a defense contractor in April 2020 but before he submitted an \nSCA. He used nitrous oxide in December 2020, after he submitted his SCA, and was on \nnotice that substance misuse was an impediment to holding a security clearance. \nHowever, almost three years have elapsed since his last substance misuse, indicating \nthat his claimed change of lifestyle was genuine. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is established. Applicant no longer associates with users of illegal \ndrugs. In his SCA, his responses during an interview by a security investigator, and in his \nanswers to DOHA interrogatories, he stated his intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement, although he did not specifically acknowledge that any future drug \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s DUI in 2010 (SOR \u00b6 4.a) and the drunken altercation \nbetween Applicant and his then cohabitant in 2014 (SOR \u00b6 4.b). The concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nThe evidence establishes the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 31(b): (\u201cevidence \n(including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official \nrecord) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, \nprosecuted, or convicted\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoth mitigating conditions are established. The two alcohol-related incidents are \nmitigated by the evidence of Applicant\u2019s decision to stop his alcohol abuse and the \npassage of time without recurrence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, G, H, and J in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nquestion him or to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines F, G, H, and J, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his excessive alcohol use, drug involvement, and criminal conduct, but he has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a and 4.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1972. He was married from 1975 \nuntil 1982. He remarried in 1985. He has two adult children. He served on active duty \nwith the Navy for about three months between 1972 and 1973, when he received a \ngeneral discharge because of a health issue. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1, 2) \nAt all times relevant to this proceeding, marijuana cultivation, sale, and \npossession has been illegal under federal law. Federal laws regarding marijuana \nsupersede any state laws that are inconsistent with it. Applicant was granted access to \nclassified information at all times relevant hereto. (Tr. 17; GE 1-4) \nIn about June 2019, after a change in state law regarding marijuana in State A \nwhere he resides, Applicant created a limited liability company (LLC) for the purpose of \ncultivating and selling medical marijuana for profit. He and his wife created the LLC \nbecause they thought it was legal and because they saw it as an opportunity to provide \na job for their son, who lacked stable employment. Applicant felt he could also draw on \nhis experience as a farmer when he was younger. They complied with State A\u2019s \nregulatory requirements and paid about $25,000 of their own money to create and run \nthe business. He left day to day operations of the business, including the marijuana \ncultivation, to his son, who lived about an hour-and-a-half away from Applicant. He \nvisited the operating location of the LLC once. The LLC was never profitable, partially \nbecause their marijuana crop never met State A\u2019s testing requirements for quality. \nThere is no evidence that the LLC ever sold any marijuana. (Tr. 17-18, 20-24; GE 2, 3, \n6) \nIn June 2021, when it came time to renew the LLC\u2019s operating license with State \nA, Applicant did not renew it. He made this decision because the business was not \nprofitable and because his son found other, stable employment. The LLC is no longer \noperational and its status with State A has been inactive since June 2021. The LLC still \nowns assets, such as pots, heat lamps, and a hoop house, but he plans to divest the \nLLC of those assets. His ability to do so was delayed and hampered by his colorectal \ncancer diagnosis in October 2022, for which he received radiation and chemotherapy \ntreatment. He now believes he is cancer free, so he will take the steps necessary to \nwind down the LLC. The LLC does not currently own any marijuana or federally illegal \nparaphernalia. He has no intention to be involved with illegal, controlled substances \never again, and claimed that if he had known it was illegal under federal law, he would \nnever have become involved. (Tr. 17-18, 20-30; GE 1-3, 6) \nAbout every year-and-a-half since 2009, Applicant has received training from his \nemployer regarding his responsibilities as a security clearance holder.

He also testified that, \nbecause it was legal pursuant to state law, he did not know that cultivating marijuana \nwas illegal pursuant to federal law or that it could affect his security clearance eligibility. \nIn about March 2020, while the LLC was operational, one of the LLC\u2019s creditors, a \ncredit-card company, canceled the LLC\u2019s credit card because of the nature of its \ntransactions. While acknowledging the cancellation, he testified that he still thought the \nLLC operations were legal because it was properly licensed with State A and legal \npursuant to the laws of State A. I observed him testify and found his testimony credible. \n(Tr. 17-18, 23, 25-28; 30-32; GE 2, 3, 5) \nUnder Guideline H in the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s operation of \nthe LLC while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position. \nUnder Guideline E in the SOR, the Government alleged his failure to report his \noperation of the LLC to his facility security officer and cross-alleged the operation of the \nLLC. (SOR; Answer) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant created the LLC for the purpose of cultivating and selling marijuana, an \nillegal drug under federal law. At one time, the LLC possessed marijuana seeds and \nplants. The above listed disqualifying condition is applicable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nis potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nIt has been over two years since Applicant\u2019s LLC ceased cultivating marijuana. \nHe created the LLC and maintained it not knowing that cultivating marijuana was illegal \npursuant to federal law. A change in state law allowing marijuana cultivation reasonably \ncontributed to his mistaken belief. He also was not aware that cultivating marijuana was \nincompatible with holding a security clearance, or that he was required to report the LLC \nor marijuana cultivation to his employer. There is no evidence that his employment \ntraining informed him of this information. He credibly testified that he will not have any \ninvolvement with illegal drugs, including marijuana, in the future. He is now fully aware \nof the precedence of federal law and that no distinction exists among marijuana use, \ncultivation, or possession. Given these considerations, in conjunction with the two-year \npassage of time, I find that the behavior happened so long ago and under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s disqualifying conduct does not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Mitigating factor \nAG \u00b6 26(a) fully applies and the Guideline H security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other government official; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in \nthat country; \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while \nlegal there, is illegal in the United States. \nAs Applicant did not know that he was required to report information regarding \nthe LLC to his facility security officer, he did not deliberately conceal or omit that \ninformation. AG \u00b6 16(b) does not apply. While he did not know that he was engaging in \nillegal conduct by operating the LLC, as growing marijuana was, in fact, illegal, this \nconduct created a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable and shifts the \nburden to Applicant to provide evidence of mitigation. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s operation of the LLC ended over two years ago. It happened under \nthe unique circumstances of a change in state law that contributed to his lack of \nunderstanding that operating the LLC was unlawful. He now knows that no involvement \nwith marijuana is legal or compatible with holding a security clearance and credibly \ntestified that he will have no involvement with illegal drugs. I find that this behavior is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. He has ceased operation of the LLC, which reduces his vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 17(c) and AG \u00b6 17(e) fully apply and the \nGuideline E conduct is mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse and personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He \nreported he was employed from 2006 to August 2021 with the same employer, Company \nC. He also reported that he was self-employed from 2016 to the present, owning his own \nbusiness. He was laid off by Company C due to the pandemic and lack of work. He \nreceived a severance package of $20,000 from Company C. He testified that he then \ndevoted all his time to his private business for about three months. He did not actively \nlook for a job. When his cash reserves began to run low, he secured a job with a federal \ncontractor in November 2021. (Tr. 13, 23-28; GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s wife was employed steadily until October 2022 when she was laid off. \nHe and his wife decided to invest in her private photography business after she lost her \njob. Beginning in 2020, he used his income from his job to fund her business while they \nwere both working. Later, they used the $20,000 of severance pay he received and about \n$6,000 to $7,000 they had in savings and invested in both of their businesses. She took \nclasses and purchased equipment that were required for the business. They hired a \nmentor to help her so she would be able to pursue the business full time. They leased \nequipment until they could complete the payments and now own the equipment. When \nshe would make a sale, they would use that money to pay the business expenses. He \nused the income from his paycheck to support his wife\u2019s business until it became \nprofitable and then the business could support itself. In June 2023, his wife rented a \nbuilding where she can run her business. All the business expenses are current. He \nestimated that her monthly expenses for the business, including personal loans she has \ntaken are approximately $10,900 a month. These expenses are being paid from the \nprofits of the business. He is hopeful this business will be successful so eventually a \nsalary can be generated. (Tr. 23-34, 120-121) \nApplicant was asked at his hearing if he had any other private businesses or \nsources of income. He said he continues to build his wife\u2019s business, and he is also a co-\nowner of a software company which was initiated between June and August 2022. He \ninvested $5,000 in the business. He obtained a loan from his mother for the investment. \nThere are two other business partners and a new chief executive officer who will \nparticipate full time but will be paid with equity in the company in lieu of salary. Applicant \nstated the business is profitable, but he cannot take a salary from it yet. (Tr. 121-123) \nApplicant testified that it is the American dream to own your own company. His \nwife\u2019s business is now generating income to break even, and this is her sole source of \nincome. He believes she can generate about $200,000 in income annually and then they \ncan eliminate their debts. He said he is no longer using his income to subsidize her \nbusiness. He decided to take the gamble and believes once her business is profitable, \nthey can resolve their debts. All her business expenses are being paid. His debts were \nput on the \u201cback burner.\u201d (Tr. 126-131) \nApplicant attributes his financial issues to a series of unfortunate events. In June \n2023, his aunt passed away, and he purchased a plane ticket for his mother to attend the \nservices. In August 2023, their vehicle was totaled in an accident.

He estimated \nthat he spent several hundred dollars for food for his wife while she was with her family. \nHe did not contribute to the funeral costs. (Tr. 37-43) \nApplicant testified that he was paying all his bills on time and was not delinquent \non any of his debts in 2020. He decided to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy in October 2020 \nbecause he had a lot of bills. He said he accumulated many of the bills during his second \nmarriage and after his divorce. His monthly Chapter 13 bankruptcy payments were \napproximately $400. He made the payments for five months. His payments were \nincreased to approximately $600 to $700 a month. He explained that his mortgage was a \nsecured loan and his attorney wanted him to sell his house. He did not want to sell it, so \nhe withdrew from the bankruptcy. He testified that his attorney advised him that if he \nwithdrew from the bankruptcy then his debts were no longer protected, and they would \nbecome due, and he would be responsible for paying them. He understood the \nconsequences and withdrew from the bankruptcy in May 2021. He said he reached out \nto his creditors and proceeded to address those who were willing to accept his payment \narrangements. Once he resolved one debt, he then would begin to resolve another. As \npart of his bankruptcy, he completed the mandatory one-hour online counseling. (Tr. 49-\n52, 56-58, 65-66; GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s current salary is approximately $150,000. Before his wife was laid off \nher salary was approximately $80,000 to $90,000. There was no point in time when they \nwere both unemployed. When Applicant applied for a job three months after he was laid \noff, he was able to secure one immediately. When he was laid off, he continued to work \nas a subcontractor for the employer but was earning less. He remained a subcontractor \nuntil June 2022. He stated that he was to receive $10,000 to $14,000 for work he had \ndone, but the employer did not pay him. (Tr. 59-64) \nApplicant testified that he hired a credit company in about August 2021 to help him \nnegotiate reasonable payment plans with his creditors. He paid the company $2,500. It \nappears the company attempted to dispute debts on Applicant\u2019s credit report. He admitted \nthe debts were valid, and he legitimately owed them. He testified that he was to send to \nthe credit company any notices he received from the creditors, which he said he did. He \nbelieves this company was a scam as they did not do what they promised. He was offered \nan opportunity to provide a copy of the contract he had with the credit company. He did \nnot. (Tr. 74-84; GE 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, he provided a contract executed on \nOctober 31, 2023, which showed he has hired a debt relief company (DRC) and enrolled \nin their credit counseling program to facilitate the repayment of his debts in the SOR.

He said he made \ndifficult choices because he knew the negative implications. He said he needed some \nbreathing room and that is why he chose to file bankruptcy. He did the best he could. He \nwants to and intends to pay his delinquent debts. He is trying to the best of his ability to \nresolve his financial issues. He does not have a written budget. (Tr. 148-154) \nIn his post-hearing submission, Applicant stated that his financial journey has \nprofoundly affected him, highlighting his lack of complete control over his situation. He \nsaid he took full responsibility for his actions and apologized. He also provided an email \naddressed to me stating he decided he had two options regarding his finances. The first \nis to refinance his home and use the equity to satisfy all his debts in full. The second is to \nsell his house and use the profit from the sale to pay his debts. Until one of those options \nis completed, he will continue to make monthly payments on his debts. He hopes to \ncomplete whatever option he decides in 30 to 45 days. (AE F) \nThree witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. They were aware he went through \nsome tough times after his divorce but were unaware of him defaulting on his debts. They \nwere aware he filed bankruptcy but then withdrew from it. They believe he is financially \nresponsible. They did not have anything negative to say about his character. (Tr. 169-\n182) \n \nCharacter letters were admitted in evidence. In them, Applicant is described as \nprofessional, dedicated, trustworthy, diligent, and responsible. He is a person of integrity \nwho abides by rules and regulations and has an impeccable work ethic. He respects the \nlaw and is committed to maintaining confidentiality. Applicant is dedicated to improving \nhis financial situation. He has consistently worked hard to address his financial challenges \nand is highly recommended for security clearance. (AE C, D, E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that have been unpaid for several years. \nHe made choices to invest in his wife\u2019s business and his business instead of paying his \ncreditors. He failed to timely file his 2019 and 2021 federal income tax returns. He testified \nhe did not file his 2022 federal income tax return timely. He failed to provide a tax \ntranscript for 2022 or evidence that he filed his federal income tax return for that year.  \nApplicant testified he did not timely file his state tax returns. I find the evidence \nsupports that the state tax returns were likely filed with his federal tax returns. Hence, \nApplicant\u2019s 2019, 2021, and 2022 state tax returns were not timely filed. He did not \nprovide evidence of when he filed these returns and if 2022 has been filed to date. \nApplicant failed to timely pay his federal income taxes for tax years 2019, 2020, \nand 2021. It is unknown if he has a federal or state tax debt for 2022. His document from \nhis state appears to show he only has a debt pending for 2021. I find he likely only owes \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstate taxes for 2021 and not earlier years. It is unknown if he owed state taxes for 2022 \nbecause he did not provide evidence that he filed his return for that year. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant voluntarily chose to withdraw from his Chapter 13 bankruptcy and was \nfully aware of the financial ramifications. He had money available to pay his creditors but \nchose to invest his severance pay of $20,000 in his wife\u2019s business. He chose to pay all \nher business expenses and to pay the expenses he had for his business. He used his \nincome beginning in approximately 2020 to pay these business expenses. He chose to \nput the payments owed to his creditors on the back burner. He has taken some action on \nsome of his SOR debts with payments, but for most of them his actions are minimal. Most \nof the debts remain unpaid with promises to work out payment plans. Other debts that he \nhas payment plans for he has not provided documents to support he has started to make \npayments or can afford to pay the settlements offered. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to caring for his mother who lives with \nthem and paying for her to travel to attend a funeral. She was able to give him a loan. He \nalso attributed it to deaths in his wife\u2019s family. He said he had to pay for his wife\u2019s food \nwhile she was away. Although this may have had some impact on his finances, these \nevents took place in 2023. He stopped making payments on most of his debts in 2020. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe clearly decided to invest in his wife\u2019s and his businesses and not pay his creditors. I \ndo not find his financial problems were beyond his control. Even if they were, he failed to \nact responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant attributes his tax issues to his tax preparers, but he failed to provide \nsubstantial evidence to conclude his 2022 federal income tax return has been filed and if \nhe has a tax debt for that year. He said he has a payment plan with the IRS but did not \nprovide a copy or evidence that he has made any payments. It appears that Applicant \nhas a payment plan for his state taxes for 2021. I do not have evidence that he has filed \nhis 2022 state tax return. I have given him the benefit of the doubt that if he filed his \nfederal tax returns for certain years, he likely also filed his state tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies to Applicant\u2019s state tax debt, but not his 2022 tax return. It does not apply to \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file his 2022 federal tax return or his failure to pay his outstanding \nfederal tax debts for 2019, 2020 and 2021. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are frequent and ongoing. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that future financial issues are unlikely to recur. His behavior casts doubt on his \nreliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant contracted with DRC, and he said he was participating in credit \ncounseling. He noted that DRC would not begin to address settling his debts until after \nseven months of payments. Since he initiated this contract on the same day as his \nhearing, it is unlikely that any credit counseling has made an impact. Currently, there are \nno clear indications that his finances are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant settled and paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c after receiving the SOR. He has \nbeen offered some settlement agreements but has not made any of the proposed \npayments. I find Applicant\u2019s priorities are to maintain his wife\u2019s business, so that sometime \nin the future it is successful to the point she may earn a substantial salary. She is not at \nthat point. In the meantime, his creditors will wait until he has the money to pay their \nsettlements offers. This does not constitute a good-faith effort to pay his overdue \ncreditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that Guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nAn applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts\nmay be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified information. \nISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 15-\n00216 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2016), citing Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local \n473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961)  \n \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.d-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.m-1.n: \nAgainst Applicant (except tax year 2020) \nSubparagraphs: 1.o-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 34 years old. He is a college graduate. He married in 2019 and recently had a child. He has worked for his present employer, a federal contactor, since 2022. (Item 3) In December 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an official from a government agency (GA). Applicant stated during the interview that in 2016 his brother supplied him with marijuana candy that Applicant consumed on this one occasion in the family home. His brother had purchased the marijuana candy in a local store in the state where they lived and where marijuana is legal to use under state law. He told the official that he had not used it or any other drug since the 2016 incident. At that time, he did not realize marijuana use was illegal under federal law. He understood his use was a mistake that he regretted, and it would not happen again. He did not disclose it on other documents because he was not focused on marijuana being illegal. He stated he had nothing to hide and could not be blackmailed. (Item 4) Applicant was interviewed again by an official from another GA in February 2020.

He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuations, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 4. Applicant did not submit any material in \nrefutation, extenuation or mitigation and did not object to any of the evidence offered by \nthe Government. Items 1 through 4 are admitted in evidence. The case was assigned to \nme on July 31, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 34 years old. He is a college graduate. He married in 2019 and recently \nhad a child. He has worked for his present employer, a federal contactor, since 2022. \n(Item 3) \nIn December 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an official from a government \nagency (GA). Applicant stated during the interview that in 2016 his brother supplied him \nwith marijuana candy that Applicant consumed on this one occasion in the family home. \nHis brother had purchased the marijuana candy in a local store in the state where they \nlived and where marijuana is legal to use under state law. He told the official that he had \nnot used it or any other drug since the 2016 incident. At that time, he did not realize \nmarijuana use was illegal under federal law. He understood his use was a mistake that \nhe regretted, and it would not happen again. He did not disclose it on other documents \nbecause he was not focused on marijuana being illegal. He stated he had nothing to hide \nand could not be blackmailed. (Item 4) \nApplicant was interviewed again by an official from another GA in February 2020. \nHe stated during this interview when discussing prior illegal drug use that he had used \nmarijuana three times between 2009 and 2016. He said he gave his brother money as a \ncontribution to purchase edible marijuana in a state where it is legal. (Item 3) \nApplicant also disclosed to the GA official that in 2015 he had purchased marijuana \nbrownies from a dispensary in state X. He consumed one marijuana brownie, gave one \nto his girlfriend, and gave the rest to his brother. He mailed the brownie to his girlfriend, \nwho was located in the same state, as part of a care package, using Federal Express. He \nsaid he was concerned about shipping the marijuana brownie because he believed it \ncould have been illegal to mail the drug, though it was never detected. He denied to the \nofficial that he had any other involvement with illegal drugs and denied having any intent \nto use them in the future. He admitted that he failed to disclose this drug involvement on \nsecurity forms he completed in October 2019 because of fear of it disqualifying him from \nemployment. (Item 3) \nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nDecember 2021.

As \nof 2018 I have not and will not attempt to acquire or use any marijuana.\u201d He listed the \nestimated date of his first use as June 2018 and his most recent use as November 2018. \n(Item 2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted that in February 2020 during a \npolygraph examination with another GA and after being advised of the penalty under Title \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, he deliberately failed to disclose his involvement with illegal drugs for \nfear of it disqualifying him from employment. (Item 1) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted that in December 2019 during an \ninterview with an official from another GA and after being advised of the penalty under \nTitle 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, he knowingly withheld his more recent drug involvement because \nhe thought that withholding it would make it less likely to disqualify him from employment. \n(Item 1) \nApplicant admitted that from about 2015 to about November 2018, he used \ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is an active ingredient in marijuana with varying \nfrequency. (Item 1) \nApplicant explained in his answer to the SOR that he has made a conscious effort \nto change his behavior and be honest and truthful. He understood his failure to disclose \ninformation during his polygraph is a serious infraction. He admitted his failure to disclose \ninformation about his drug involvement occurred twice during his investigation from 2019 \nto 2020 and it has been three years since this occurred. He now has a family, and he \nwants to teach his child the values of being honest, truthful, and personal integrity. His \nprior motivation for failing to be honest was self-preservation and based on fear and \nshame. He further explained that during an incident at work that could have been \ndamaging, he admitted his wrongdoing and accepted responsibility when he could have \nbeen removed from a project. He said he chose to be honest to his supervisor. He \nbelieves he has demonstrated a change in his behavior. He said in 2022 he went through \nanother full investigation, and he was truthful even when the information could have been \nharmful to obtaining a clearance and employment. He stated he will continue to make a \nconscious effort to be truthful and honest in all circumstances that do not benefit him. He \nacknowledged he made a mistake and has learned from it. (Item 1) \nRegarding his past drug use, Applicant explained that he understands marijuana \nuse is illegal under federal law and his use was recreational and has ceased since 2018. \nIt has been five years since his last use of marijuana. He has no desire to use it in the \nfuture. He has responsibilities towards his family and employment and its illegal nature \nare his primary motivators to not use it again in the future.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16, and following that may be \npotentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nIn December 2019 Applicant knowingly withheld his complete drug involvement \nduring a subject interview with an official from another GA after being advised of his duty \nto tell the truth under penalty of law. He believed that making such a disclosure would \nlikely disqualify him from employment. In February 2020 after being advised that under \npenalty of law he was required to tell the truth, he deliberately failed to disclose the extent \nof his marijuana use when he was interviewed for a polygraph examination by an official \nwith another GA because he feared if he did it would disqualify him from employment. \nThe above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his falsifications before \nhe was confronted with the facts. In his SOR answer, he acknowledges his mistakes in \nnot being truthful in the past and promises to be truthful in the future. He was over 30 \nyears old when he deliberately failed to provide honest answers during the investigative \nprocess, which is past the age of youthful immaturity. The investigative process relies on \npeople who are trusted with the nations secrets to provide honest answers each and \nevery time. It should not have to be a conscious decision to tell the truth but rather an \nautomatic response. Applicant failed to do so when he was interviewed by a government \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nofficial and then a few months later again failed to do so during a polygraph interview. He \nfeared the impact of telling the truth would have on his employment opportunities. His \nconduct was not minor, and it occurred on more than one occasion. I have insufficient \nevidence to conclude that future self-preservation conduct is unlikely to recur. His conduct \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating \nconditions do not apply. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used THC an active ingredient in marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about 2015 to about November 2018. The above disqualifying conditions \napply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The \nfollowing mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant acknowledged his drug use and its infrequency. He stated in his answer \nto the SOR that he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future due to becoming a \nfather and wanting to set a good example, his employment, and that it is illegal under \nfederal law. There is no evidence he has used illegal drugs since 2018. Although it is \nlikely he still associates with his brother, I believe he has put his recreational marijuana \nuse behind him and is committed to abstinence. The above mitigating conditions apply. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b cross-alleged under the drug involvement and substance misuse \nguideline the personal conduct paragraph under Guideline E. No specific conduct was \nalleged. Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose information about his drug use and his \ndeliberate withholding of information was appropriately alleged under Guideline E, so the \ncross-allegation under Guideline H is unnecessary. I find for Applicant on the cross-\nallegation at SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant failed to meet his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse but did not mitigate those under Guideline E, personal conduct. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on February 22, 2023. The case was assigned to another administrative judge \non March 7, 2023. The case was reassigned to me on April 6, 2023. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on April 12, 2023. The case \nwas heard on June 14, 2023. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on June \n23, 2023. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 8, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She asked that the record remain \nopen for the receipt of additional documentation. She submitted Applicant Exhibit A in a \ntimely fashion, which was admitted without objection. The record closed on July 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 55 years old and divorced from her second husband. She has a high \nschool diploma and is currently attending college. She has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since 2005 and is currently a senior analyst.

The existence of all the debts is also supported \nby Applicant\u2019s answers during an interview with an investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) on August 9, 2022. (Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 40-44.) \nApplicant stated that her financial difficulties were due to having to take care of her \nailing mother, as well as other family-related emergencies.

She \nworked with DRF 1 starting in 2017 or 2018, as shown by documentation from DRF 1 \nprovided by Applicant. She was paying them approximately $433 a month to help her \nresolve her debts. The documentation did not show the debts they were paying or  \nwhether Applicant successfully completed the program. She testified that she had \nstopped using DRF 1 in either 2020 or 2021. Government Exhibit 8 does show several \npaid charge offs during the time she was using DRF 1. (Government Exhibit 8 at 16, 18,-\n20; Applicant Exhibit A at 12-16; Tr. 26-28, 39-40, 42-43.) \nApplicant began working with DRF 2 in August 2022. She was still working with \nthem at the date of the hearing. Documentation from DRF 2, provided by Applicant, \nindicates that she is paying $468 a month to them to help resolve her debts. The \ndocumentation dated July 26, 2023, states that six accounts are enrolled, one of which \nhas a settlement agreement in place. That particular account is not identified. In addition, \nthe partial account numbers of the six accounts shown do not match any of those of the \nallegations in the SOR. It is noted that some of the DRF 2 accounts are reflected in the \nGovernment\u2019s credit reports. (Government Exhibit 5; Applicant Exhibit A at 9-11; Tr. 28-\n29, 44-45, 47-49, 52-53.)  \nApplicant testified that she is unhappy with the service she is receiving from DRF \n2 and may attempt to resolve her debts on her own. (Answer; Tr. 22-23, 52-53.) \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant admitted owing Creditor A $19,980 for account ending 2288. This \ndebt was charged off, as confirmed by the latest credit report in the record. This debt does \nnot appear in the documentation from DRF 2. No further information was provided. This \ndebt is not resolved. (Government Exhibit 8 at 20; Tr. 24-27.) \n1.b. Applicant admitted owing Creditor A $11,992 for account ending 2582. This \ndebt was charged off, as confirmed by the latest credit report in the record. This debt does \nnot appear in the documentation from DRF 2. No further information was provided. This \ndebt is not resolved. (Government Exhibit 8 at 21; Tr. 30-31.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing Creditor C $4,096 for account ending 8058. This \ndebt was shown as charged off with a balance owing on the credit report dated October \n24, 2022. The credit reports dated February 22, 2023; and June 13, 2023, show the debt \nwith no past-due amount and the statement, \u201cConsumer disputes after resolution.\u201d This \ndebt does not appear in the documentation from DRF 2.

This \ndebt was charged off, as confirmed by the latest credit report in the record. This debt does \nnot appear in the documentation from DRF 2. No further information was provided. This \ndebt is not resolved. (Government Exhibit 8 at 4; Tr. 32.) \n1.e. Applicant admitted owing Creditor E $2,812 for account ending 5382. This \npast-due debt appears in the October 24, 2022 credit report with the annotation, \u201cAccount \ninformation disputed by consumer.\u201d This debt does not appear in the latest two credit \nreports in the record. This debt also does not appear in the documentation from DRF 2. \nHowever, based on the existing record I find there is insufficient evidence to show \nApplicant continues to owe this debt. This allegation is found for Applicant. (Government \nExhibit 6 at 3; Exhibit 7; and Exhibit 8; Tr. 32-33.) \n1.f. Applicant admitted owing Creditor F $2,447 for account ending 9331. This \ncharged-off account appears on the February 22, 2023 credit report with the annotation, \n\u201cConsumer disputes after resolution.\u201d This debt does not appear in the latest credit report \nin the record. This debt also does not appear in the documentation from DRF 2. However, \nbased on the existing record I find there is insufficient evidence to show Applicant \ncontinues to owe this debt. This allegation is found for Applicant. (Government Exhibit 6 \nat 2; Exhibit 7 at 10; and Exhibit 8 at 7; Tr. 34-35.) \n1.g. Applicant admitted owing Creditor G $1,885 for account ending 1072. This \ndebt was charged off, as confirmed by the latest credit report in the record. This debt does \nnot appear in the documentation from DRF 2. No further information was provided. This \ndebt is not resolved. (Government Exhibit 8 at 4; Tr. 35.) \nApplicant testified that her current financial situation is tight. She does not have \nmuch discretionary income. Applicant realizes her finances can affect her national \nsecurity eligibility but has not yet been in a position to reduce or pay off her past-due \nindebtedness. It is noted that Applicant was often confused during her testimony as to the \nactual status of her debts. (Tr. 35-38, 52-53.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause she has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness or \nunreliability. Applicant admitted the factual allegations under this guideline. However, she \ndenied having an intent to falsify the questionnaire. \nApplicant filled out her e-QIP on October 25, 2021. Section 26 of that questionnaire \nconcerns Applicant\u2019s financial situation. Several subsections ask whether, within seven \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nyears of filling out the questionnaire, Applicant had bills or debts turned over to a collection \nagency; or had an account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing \nto pay as agreed? Applicant answered both questions, \u201cNo.\u201d As stated, Applicant had \npast-due debts, so this was an incorrect answer to a relevant question about her financial \nsituation. (Government Exhibit 1.) \nApplicant was interviewed by a Government investigator on August 9, 2022. When \nfirst questioned about delinquent debts, \u201cSubject [Applicant] indicated she is currently up \nto date on all her financial obligations.\u201d When confronted with the fact she had \ndelinquencies she stated she was working with DRF 1. She further stated that she \nbelieved DRF 1 had resolved all of her debts. This was incorrect. (Government Exhibit 2 \nat 2.) \nApplicant subsequently stated in her Answer: \nI deny that I attempt[ed] to falsify information. I provided information to the \nbest of my ability the debts in questioned [sic] happened in 2015-2016 \ntimeframe, which is outside of seven-year scope. I was working with a debt \nconsolidation [service] to settle these outstanding debts. I was under the \nimpression that once this was initiated all negative credit reporting would \ncease. \nIn her testimony, Applicant expanded on these statements. She stated that she \nhad a good-faith belief that working with DRF 1 and DRF 2 meant that she was not \ndelinquent on the debts since she was agreeing to the revised payments and payment \nplans in a legal and above-board way. (TR 38-39, 50-51.) \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted documentation showing she is a respected person and \nemployee. Her supervisor stated, \u201cI know her to be trustworthy with program information \nand customer hardware and documentation.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A at 5-8.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has seven debts listed in the SOR that were charged-off, or in collection, \nin the total amount of approximately $46,521. Each of these debts involved contracts for \ndiscretionary consumer purchases. While she has been working with two debt resolution \nfirms for several years, she was unsure of the present status of any of these debts. These \nfacts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has not mitigated the security significance of her past-due indebtedness, \nexcept in part. As stated, SOR allegations 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f are found for Applicant due to \na lack of evidence showing that they are current delinquent debts. However, the \nremaining debts have been in existence for many years, and Applicant admitted having \nlittle information as to their current status. The documentation submitted by Applicant from \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDRF 1 and DRF 2 was insufficient to show that the remaining debts have been paid, or \nthat there is a plan to pay them. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant has behaved \nresponsibly under the circumstances, as required by AG \u00b6 20(b). She is fully aware of the \nimpact delinquent debt can have on her security clearance eligibility, but has not done \nsufficient work to resolve the issue. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s situation. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns pertaining to the personal conduct guideline are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2 that Applicant falsified the e-QIP that she \nfilled out on October 25, 2021, by not admitting that she had delinquent debts. I find that \nApplicant did not intend to falsify her answers on the questionnaire. The evidence is clear \nthat Applicant had a good-faith, if erroneous, belief that she did not have to say her debts \nwere delinquent because she had turned them over to the DRF, and they were working \nwith the creditors. In other words, she believed that the action in hiring the DRF to help \nher meant that the debts were no longer delinquent since active negotiations were going \non. \nIn addition, Applicant also argued that her debts arose in 2015 and therefore were \noutside of the seven-year window for delinquency stated in the question. The \nquestionnaire was completed in 2021. This argument also has some merit. \nBased on my finding that Applicant did not intend to falsify her answers on the \nquestionnaire, none of the disqualifying or general Personal Conduct guideline concerns \napply to Applicant\u2019s conduct. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a successful \nemployee. However, her financial situation makes her ineligible for clearance at this time. \nIf she is able to get her finances under control, she may be eligible for a security clearance \nin the future. She is not eligible now because continuation of financial irresponsibility is \nlikely, and the potential for pressure or duress remains undiminished. Overall, the record \nevidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

He did not have any \nobjections to the Government\u2019s evidence. He provided documents that are marked as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through K. There were no objections, and they were admitted \nin evidence. The case was assigned to me on June 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted both SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. He graduated from high school in 2001.

He served in the National Guard from \n2014 to 2018 and was honorably discharged. He never married and has no children. He \nhas worked for a federal contractor since November 2018. (Item 4) \nIn May 2021 Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). In it he \ndisclosed that he failed to file his 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 federal income tax returns. \nHe stated in the SCA for each tax year that he initially failed to file because \u201cdue to finding \ntime to go to a tax preparer and missed the filing deadline.

The delay is all of my \nown doing and I accept that responsibility. (Item 4) \nIn June 2021 Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He was \nquestioned about his failure to timely file his income tax returns. He told the investigator \nhe did not have a good reason and he was going to speak to a tax preparer to file the \ndelinquent returns and would provide an update. He said it would never happen again \nand in the past seven years he had not failed to file any other federal, state, or other tax \nreturns as required by law. (Item 5) \nApplicant completed government interrogatories in March 2022. He attached email \ncorrespondence between him and a tax preparer from March 2022 acknowledging they \nhad been employed by Applicant and his request for documented verification to show his \ntax returns were being prepared. In the email correspondence, the tax preparer notes he \nwill be preparing Applicant\u2019s 2016 through 2021 federal and state income tax returns. \nApplicant acknowledged he would need the preparer to complete his 2016 and 2017 state \nincome tax returns. He lived in a state during the other years that does not have income \ntaxes. Applicant\u2019s email stated he had not filed his tax returns since 2015.

(Item 6) \nApplicant stated in his interrogatories that he did not have a good reason for his \nfailure to timely file his income tax returns, beyond his own anxiety. He noted he had \nengaged a tax preparer to remedy the issue. He said he had panicked when he was late \npaying taxes at one point, and it then snowballed and each year he worried more and \nmore. At that time, his income tax returns were not yet filed but the tax preparer was \nworking on them. (Item 6) \nApplicant provided an updated response to government interrogatories in October \n2022. He explained that his tax service requested his IRS W-2 forms to complete his 2017 \nand 2018 state tax return. Applicant was advised that the Defense Finance & Accounting \nService (DFAS) did not keep these documents beyond five years. He then requested the \ninformation through his state department of revenue. (Item 6) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he stated that in December 2022 he mailed his 2016 \nthrough 2019 federal income tax returns to the IRS. Due to their age he could not file \nelectronically. His 2020 and 2021 federal income tax returns were filed electronically and \naccepted by the IRS on February 7, 2023. As of the same date, he also filed his state \nincome tax returns for 2017 and 2018. He was still attempting to locate the income data \nnecessary to file his 2016 state income tax return and had made several attempts through \nvarious agencies to retrieve the data. Once he retrieved the data, his tax preparer would \ncomplete the 2016 state income tax return. Applicant provided appropriate documents to \ncorroborate his actions. (Item 2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he provided federal income tax transcripts. \nHis 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax year transcripts reflect they were received in December \n2022. His 2019 tax year transcript reflects it was filed by April 15, 2020, which would be \ntimely. The 2019 tax transcript does not have any financial data in it. It lists Applicant\u2019s \nadjusted gross income as $1.00. It notes a representative was appointed on April 6, 2022, \nand the IRS received the tax balance owed of $199 on March 27, 2023. This is consistent \nwith Applicant\u2019s other documents and statements that he did not file timely for 2019. His \nother documents show that for tax years 2020 and 2021, he filed electronically on \nFebruary 7, 2023. He electronically filed his 2022 federal tax return on April 25, 2023. He \nowed $466 for tax years 2020 and $631 for tax year 2021. He paid the balances on March \n27, 2023. (AE A-K) \nApplicant confirmed in his FORM response that his 2017 and 2018 state income \ntax returns were mailed in February 2023. He said he was still unable to retrieve \ninformation he needed to file his state tax return for 2016. It is unclear why this information \nis not available from his 2016 federal income tax return. He has continued to send letters \nand email requests to various state agencies to obtain the information. He intends to file \nhis 2016 state income tax return when he retrieves the necessary documents.

He does not intend to fall into the trap of anxiety and complacency \nagain. He was dealing with the death of his father in August 2022 and the uncertainty of \nwhether the contract for his job would be renewed. He does not use these facts as an \nexcuse. He got behind on his tax filings and let his worry about how much he might owe \nin taxes override his good judgment. He stated it would not happen again. He understands \nhe made a mistake and can see the consequences for any further failings. (AE I) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. However, it may be considered in the application of mitigating \nconditions, in making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021 federal income \ntax returns. I conclude that based on all of the evidence, he did not timely file his 2019 \nfederal income tax return. He failed to timely file his 2016 through 2018 state income tax \nreturns. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant voluntarily disclosed in his May 2021 SCA that he failed to file federal \nincome tax returns for multiple years. In June 2021, he explained to the investigator that \nhe was hiring a tax professional to help him file his delinquent tax returns. He admitted \nhe did not have a valid excuse for not timely filing, other than anxiety and then each year \nit snowballed. In March 2022, he hired a tax professional to help him. He mailed his \nfederal income tax returns for 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 in December 2022, and his \n2020 and 2021 were electronically filed in February 2023. Applicant provided \ndocumentation that all of his delinquent federal income tax returns are now filed, and he \npaid the taxes that were due. He provided documentation that his 2017 and 2018 state \nincome tax returns have been filed. Despite his best efforts, he has been unable to find \nthe necessary documents to file his 2016 state income tax return due to the length of \ntime. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions. I find AG \u00b6 20(g) applies in that \nhis income tax returns have essentially all been filed. I find none of the other mitigating \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconditions apply. Although there is some mitigation, it is insufficient to overcome the \nsecurity concerns raised by his failure to abide by the law and exercise good judgment \nover many years. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion.

Applicant \nhas held a security clearance since 2004. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in February 2023. He earns \nabout $110,000 annually. He receives Air Force retirement of about $2,000 monthly. \nHe also receives about $4,000 monthly in VA disability due to being 100 percent \ndisabled. His job with a defense contractor requires a security clearance. \nApplicant explained that his parents immigrated to the United States from the \nPhilippines.

Applicant stated that this is a delinquent credit card. \nApplicant contends that he has paid off this debt. \nHe has not provided any \ndocumentation to show that the debt has been resolved. (Tr. pp. 56-57.) The debt \nremains owing. \n1.f. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $707. Applicant stated that this is a delinquent credit card. \nApplicant claims that this debt is related to a timeshare that he purchased sometime \nbetween 2008 and 2012. Applicant contends that he has paid the debt. He has not \nprovided documentation to show that the debt has been resolved. (Tr. pp. 59-60.) The \ndebt remains owing. \n1.g. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $5,676. Applicant explained that this is a car loan that Applicant \ncontends has been paid off. He has not provided documentation to show that the debt \nhas been resolved.  (Tr. p. 61.) The debt remains owing. \n1.h. In August 2016, while on active duty with the United States Air Force, Applicant \nreceived non-judicial punishment for Misuse of a Government Travel Card. Applicant \nexplained that he was stationed in Texas at the time. He was on a family trip, and on \nleave from work to spend New Year\u2019s Eve in Las Vegas.

As a result of this misconduct, Applicant lost \nhis rank and his security clearance was suspended for about five or six months. (Tr. pp. \n68.) His rank was eventually reinstated. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nengaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant admitted the allegations set forth under this guideline. \n2.a. As discussed above, in August 2016, Applicant misused his Government credit \ncard while on vacation in Las Vegas, and used it to purchase personal items. Applicant \nreceived non-judicial punishment for Misuse of the Government Travel Card. He was \nreduced in rank and his security clearance was suspended for five or six months. At \nsome later date, Applicant\u2019s rank was reinstated upon application to the Air Force. (Tr. \npp. 62-67.) \n2.b. In about January 2021, while on active duty with the United States Air Force, \nApplicant received a Letter of Reprimand for borrowing money from a subordinate.  \nApplicant explained that he was a Staff NCO, Tech Sergeant, E-6 in the Air Force when \nhe went to his subordinate an E-4, a young Airman and borrowed either $1,200.00 or \n$1,500.00 from him.  Applicant explained that he needed the money at the time as his \ncar needed maintenance, and his credit was not good.  He did not strong arm his \nsubordinate to loan the money to him, but does recognize the power difference between \nthe two of them, and knew that it was inappropriate to ask his subordinate for help.  \nApplicant stated that he set up a payment arrangement to pay his subordinate back at \nthe rate of $500 a month.  Applicant\u2019s supervisor heard about this situation from other \nairmen and Applicant was disciplined.  Applicant received non-judicial punishment for \nthis misconduct, lost rank, and was not recommended for promotion.  Following this, \nApplicant retired from the military.  (Tr. pp. 68-76.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nApplicant has incurred delinquent debts that he could not afford to pay. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each one of them set forth below: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nFor many years, Applicant has lived beyond his means, spending more money \nthan he could afford. He has not demonstrated that his financial indebtedness has been \nresolved and is unlikely to recur. Accordingly, this guideline is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the Personal Conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the dividual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports \na \nwhile-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(1) Untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; and \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s inappropriate behavior reflects a pattern of poor judgment which is \nrelated to his financial indebtedness. In 2016, he misused the Government credit card \nand purchased personal items with it, knowing it to be against Federal rules and military \npolicy. Applicant\u2019s own credit cards were not in good standing nor did he have the \nmoney to pay for these personal items. In addition, in January 2021, while on active \nduty, Applicant borrowed a large amount of money from a subordinate to repair his car \nbecause he could not afford to pay for it himself. This was also against military rules \nand regulations. His inappropriate behavior and lack of integrity and responsibility \nshows poor judgment, untrustworthiness, and unreliability. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 below: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nTo be eligible for access to classified information, Applicant\u2019s overall character \nand conduct must consistently show a pattern of honesty, integrity, good judgment and \nreliability. Applicant has not demonstrated a consistent pattern of good judgment. In \nfact, he has shown poor judgment impacted by his history of financial indebtedness. \nApplicant needs more time to show that he can resolve his debts and use good \njudgment to be trusted under any circumstances. Under the particular facts of this case, \nnone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Accordingly, this guideline is found \nagainst the Applicant. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. At this time, Applicant has \nnot demonstrated that he can be trusted with the national secrets. \nThis is not an \nindividual with whom the Government can be confident to know that he will always \nfollow rules and regulations, and do the right thing, even when no one is looking. \nApplicant does not meet the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations and Personal \nConduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.h. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a and 2.b. \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answers, he admitted the allegation in the SOR with explanations. His admission is adopted as a finding of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 43 years old. He married in 2001 and has three children, two who still live at home. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2001 to 2005 and deployed twice to combat areas. He was honorably discharged. He holds a master\u2019s degree. He has worked for his current defense-contractor employer since 2008. He has held a clearance for approximately 20 years and has never had a security incident. (Tr. 88-89, 91-92; GE 1) The SOR alleged in October 2020 that Applicant was charged with felony assault, misdemeanor assault, false imprisonment, two counts of child abuse, harassment, and criminal mischief. In March 2021, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and received a two-year supervised deferred judgment. The events leading to his conviction are described below.

DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answers, he admitted the allegation in the SOR with explanations. \nHis admission is adopted as a finding of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 43 years old. He married in 2001 and has three children, two who \nstill live at home. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2001 to 2005 and deployed \ntwice to combat areas. He was honorably discharged. He holds a master\u2019s degree. He \nhas worked for his current defense-contractor employer since 2008. He has held a \nclearance for approximately 20 years and has never had a security incident. (Tr. 88-89, \n91-92; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged in October 2020 that Applicant was charged with felony \nassault, misdemeanor assault, false imprisonment, two counts of child abuse, \nharassment, and criminal mischief. In March 2021, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor \nassault and received a two-year supervised deferred judgment. The events leading to \nhis conviction are described below. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nOn October 17, 2020, at approximately 11:30 pm, police officers (Officers) \nresponded to a call for assistance at Applicant\u2019s home. The call was made by one of \nApplicant\u2019s teenage daughters. The call reported a domestic violence incident between \nApplicant and his wife. (GE 2 (Affidavit of Probable Cause)) \nUpon arriving at the home, the Officers knocked several times before Applicant \nresponded. The Officers explained to Applicant that they were responding to a reported \ndomestic disturbance. The Officers indicated they needed to enter the residence \nbecause of the nature of the reported domestic disturbance. According to the Officers, \nApplicant refused their entry and told them they needed a warrant to enter his home. \nThe Officers entered the home even though Applicant attempted to keep them out. He \nfurther resisted being handcuffed. Applicant\u2019s answers to Government interrogatories \ngive a contrasting version of these events. Applicant stated, \u201cWhen police arrived at the \nscene, I was cordial and non-resistant as bodycams can show. I was very confused as \nto why the police wanted force [sic] entry into my residence, but I complied, \nnonetheless.\u201d I find the Officers\u2019 report more credible than Applicant\u2019s. (GE 2 (Affidavit \nof Probable Cause; Applicant\u2019s answer to interrogatory question 1 at attachment 1)) \nThe Officers went to the basement and found Applicant\u2019s wife and two daughters \nlocked in a bedroom.

An Officer pushed the door open. Applicant\u2019s wife was \nobserved to have a cut lip, swelling on the side of her face, a bruised eye with blood in \nit, and red marks on her neck. Applicant\u2019s wife told the Officers that she and her \nhusband got into an argument and it spiraled out of control. She was hit in the head and \nshe believed Applicant tried to drag her down the stairs by her neck. One of the \ndaughters stated to the Officers that her mother told her multiple times that Applicant hit \nher on the head when she was on the stairs. She and her two daughters were able to \nbarricade themselves in a bedroom by locking the door and placing a wooden desk \nagainst the door. Applicant tried to break the door down. One of the daughters \ncorroborated that Applicant tried to break down the bedroom door. Applicant testified \nthat he did not attempt to break the door down and that it was damaged weeks before \nby his nephew. He also claimed he did not strike or strangle his wife. I do not find \nApplicant\u2019s testimony credible. (Tr. 78, 84; GE 2 (Affidavit of Probable Cause)) \nBased upon the observations of the Officers, the statements by Applicant\u2019s wife \nand two daughters, and the evidence of physical injuries to Applicant\u2019s wife, as \nsupported by the information contained in the \u201cAffidavit of Probable Cause,\u201d Applicant \nwas arrested on the charges of: felony assault, misdemeanor assault, false \nimprisonment, child abuse, criminal mischief, and harassment. (GE 2 (Affidavit of \nProbable Cause)) \nIn March 2021, Applicant entered into a plea agreement, whereby he pleaded \nguilty to one count of misdemeanor assault and the case was handled as a deferred \njudgment and sentence. Applicant\u2019s conditions included being on supervised probation \nfor two years, completion of a domestic-violence evaluation and a substance-abuse \nevaluation, and compliance with all treatment recommendations from the evaluations. \nApplicant complied with the terms by being evaluated. He followed those evaluations \nwith participation in domestic violence and anger management treatment from May \n2021 to February 2022. Substance-abuse assessments were completed in March 2021 \n(no indication of the results of this evaluation). Applicant\u2019s supervised deferred sentence \nwas converted to unsupervised deferred sentence in March 2022. He successfully \ncompleted all the terms of his deferred sentence in March 2023 and his record \nconcerning this case was sealed by the court at that time. (GE 2 (Stipulation For \nDeferred Judgment and Sentence and Court Order; Plea Agreement; Petition and Order \nto Convert Supervised to Unsupervised); AE D (Order to Seal Record)) \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified at his hearing that the events that led to Applicant\u2019s \narrest and conviction were partially her fault because she became intoxicated that \nevening, and threw and broke objects in their home. She also said this was a one-time \nincident that had not happened before. She did not believe Applicant assaulted her that \nevening, rather he was trying to deescalate the situation. She does not believe her \nchildren were put at risk. She said that Applicant had one glass of champagne that \nnight. She has been in an alcohol-treatment program in the past that included \nmedication. She is not in a program now. She claims about one year of sobriety, off and \non.

(Tr. 35-38, 40, 45, 47; GE 2 (Affidavit of Probable \nCause)) \nIn May 2021, as part of a court-ordered referral, Applicant began seeing Ms. B, a \nlicensed professional counselor. Applicant engaged in 10 months of domestic-violence \ntherapy and approximately 12 weeks of anger-management therapy. He successfully \ncompleted his treatment regimen and Ms. B opined that he was at the \u201clow to medium \nend\u201d of the scale regarding future recidivism. Ms. B also stated Applicant was honest, \naccountable and took responsibility for his actions. She believed that alcohol contributed \nto his action the night in question. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s claims at hearing, Ms. B \nbelieved he was intoxicated the night of his arrest. She concluded this based upon the \npolice report and his admissions to her during treatment. (Tr. 18-26; AE A-B) \nApplicant testified he accepts responsibility for his actions the night of his arrest. \nHe maintains that he only had one glass of champagne that evening and was not drunk. \nOne of the Officers described his observation of Applicant upon his arrival as such, \u201cI \nobserved [Applicant] to have bloodshot and watery eyes, slurred speech and difficulty \nwith balance.\u201d Applicant testified that he now abstains from alcohol use. He believes the \npolice report describing the evening\u2019s events is inaccurate. He learned self-control and \nhow to avoid conflict from his therapy with Ms. B. (Tr. 79-80; 83-84, 90; GE 2 (Police \nReport, Case # 2020-00036075, p. 5 of 6) \nTwo witnesses who have worked with Applicant for approximately 12 years \ntestified on his behalf. Both believed Applicant is a peaceful person, that they have \nnever seen him abuse alcohol, and that they would trust him holding a security \nclearance. One witness stated that he was aware of the incident in question, but that \nknowledge did not change any of his opinions about Applicant. Applicant also presented \nfive letters from coworkers and former coworkers who universally laud his \ntrustworthiness, worth ethic, and reliability. (Tr. 58-63, 65-69; AE F-J) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was charged with multiple offenses arising from the October 2020 \nincident at his home and he ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault in \nMarch 2021. I find that the above disqualifying condition applies. \nI have also considered all the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under AG \n\u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has made positive strides toward rehabilitation by successfully \ncompleting his domestic-violence and anger-management therapy. There is no \nevidence of any subsequent violent behavior towards his family. However, I am \nconcerned that he continues to minimize his actions that contributed to the domestic \nviolence charge the night of his arrest. He has denied his assault (hitting or striking her) \non his wife that conflicts with the physical injuries she suffered and her statements \nmade to the police and her daughters. He denied damaging the door in his home, \ndespite contrary statements by his daughters. He denied the extent of his alcohol use \nthat night, despite the contrary observation of the responding Officers and his statement \nto the contrary to Ms. B. I also must temper the amount of stock I put into his \nsubsequent clean record since the incident because he was under the terms of his \nprobation through March 2023. It is too soon to tell, at this point, whether he will \ncontinue to abstain from domestic violence incidents without the threat of a probation \nviolation hanging over him. Therefore, his actions cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. His rehabilitation is not sufficiently established. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice, including his combat deployments, and the testimony and statements of \nsupport by his colleagues. However, I also considered his continued minimization of his \nactions the night of his arrest. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations in her Answer, with explanations. She is 34 years old. As of her May 2022 security clearance application (SCA), she was not married, she did not have any children, and she has lived with her parents since 2019. She graduated from high school in 2008. She attended college in 2008 or 2009 and in 2013, but she did not earn a degree. She has worked as a mechanical technician for her employer, a DOD contractor, since approximately November 2010. She was first granted a security clearance in approximately April 2019. (Items 1-6) Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from approximately July 2008 to November 2017. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) She used it socially and less than ten times. She disclosed this marijuana use on her July 2018 SCA. She indicated therein that she did not intend to use marijuana in the future because, \u201cI don\u2019t like the smell or taste of it.\u201d (Items 2-4) In approximately July 2021, while holding a security clearance, Applicant purchased and used a vape pen containing marijuana. She indicated in her August 2022 background interview that she smoked marijuana on this occasion recreationally, in her home, with a friend because she was bored. It made her feel relaxed. She further indicated that she realized she was not allowed to consume marijuana while possessing a security clearance, but she made a bad judgment call. She stated in her January 2023 response to interrogatories that this was a \u201cone time purchase",

The Government\u2019s documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 6 are admitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations in her Answer, with explanations. She \nis 34 years old. As of her May 2022 security clearance application (SCA), she was not \nmarried, she did not have any children, and she has lived with her parents since 2019. \nShe graduated from high school in 2008. She attended college in 2008 or 2009 and in \n2013, but she did not earn a degree. She has worked as a mechanical technician for \nher employer, a DOD contractor, since approximately November 2010. She was first \ngranted a security clearance in approximately April 2019. (Items 1-6) \nApplicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from approximately July 2008 \nto November 2017. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) She used it socially and less than ten times. She \ndisclosed this marijuana use on her July 2018 SCA. She indicated therein that she did \nnot intend to use marijuana in the future because, \u201cI don\u2019t like the smell or taste of it.\u201d \n(Items 2-4) \nIn approximately July 2021, while holding a security clearance, Applicant \npurchased and used a vape pen containing marijuana. She indicated in her August \n2022 background interview that she smoked marijuana on this occasion recreationally, \nin her home, with a friend because she was bored. It made her feel relaxed. She further \nindicated that she realized she was not allowed to consume marijuana while possessing \na security clearance, but she made a bad judgment call. She stated in her January 2023 \nresponse to interrogatories that this was a \u201cone time purchase with cash legally in \nCalifornia. I think it was $30.\u201d She stated that she decided thereafter to stop using illegal \nsubstances because \u201cI just didn\u2019t like it and I honestly felt bad about it.\u201d She further \nstated that she did not have any intentions for future marijuana use, and she did not \nassociate with individuals who use illegal substances or frequent places where illegal \nsubstances are used. (SOR \u00b6 2.a; Items 2, 5) \nApplicant did not disclose her relevant drug involvement in response to section \n23 of her 2022 SCA, which inquired about illegal use of drugs or drug activity. She \nmarked \u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose her marijuana use from 2015 to 2017, and in 2021, in \nresponse to a question that inquired whether she had illegally used any drug or \ncontrolled substances in the last seven years. She also marked \u201cNo,\u201d and did not \ndisclose her use of marijuana in 2021, while holding a security clearance, in response to \na question that inquired whether she had ever illegally used or otherwise been illegally \ninvolved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. She \nalso disclosed that she had a security clearance that was granted to her in 2019.

She stated in her Answer that she \nmisunderstood the question. She stated: \nWhen answering the question, I interpreted the question with\n\u201cPREVIOUSLY LISTED\u201d as in everything that I have listed including the\nincident in 2021. I have clearly misunderstood the wording of this\nquestion. (GE 2, 5) \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . . ;\u201d and \n\u201c(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nApplicant used marijuana from 2008 to 2017. She also purchased and used \nmarijuana in 2021, while holding a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana from 2008 to 2017, and again as \nrecently as 2021. She said she was aware when she used it in 2021 that she had a \nsecurity clearance. Her last use is recent enough that I cannot find that it is unlikely to \nrecur. Although she expressed her intent to abstain from marijuana, she previously \nstated such an intention in her 2018 SCA and yet, she used marijuana again because \nshe was bored. She did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. I find that none of the above mitigating conditions \nare established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant marked \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose her marijuana use from 2015 to \n2017, and in 2021, while holding a security clearance, in response to relevant questions \non her May 2022 SCA. I do not find credible her claims, during her August 2022 \nbackground interview and in her Answer, that she did not realize she omitted her drug \nuse from her SCA and that she misunderstood the question. She previously completed \nan SCA in 2018 and disclosed her relevant marijuana use, and yet she deliberately \nmarked \u201cNo,\u201d in response to the relevant questions about her drug use on her 2022 \nSCA. She knew, and disclosed on her 2022 SCA, that she was granted a security \nclearance in 2019, and she knew she was not allowed to consume marijuana while \npossessing a security clearance. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not make prompt, good-faith efforts to correct her omissions on her \nregarding her relevant drug use on her 2022 SCA. Her omissions were not caused or \ncontributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with professional responsibilities \nfor security processes. Her omissions are not minor, occurred recently in 2022, and \nraises questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. She failed to take \nresponsibility for her deliberate omissions in her Answer. As such, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline E in this whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the personal conduct and drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e. He denied SOR allegation \u00b6 1.f. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 7 and 11.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2012. (TR at page 13 line 22 to page 15 line 21, and GX 1 at pages 11~12.) He is unmarried and has no children. (GX 1 at page 16.) Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to gambling. (TR at page 15 line 22 to page 18 line 24.) He ceased on-line gambling in 2019, and last gambled in Las Vegas in March of 2022, a little more than a year prior to his hearing. (Id.) Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.a., and 1.c~1.e. Applicant admits to past-due debts to Creditor A totaling about $26,000. He has yet to address these admitted debts. These allegations are found against Applicant. 1.b. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of about $7,378. He is making monthly payments of $400~$500, which is 25% of his paycheck towards this admitted debt.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 3, 2023, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.

He denied SOR \nallegation \u00b6 1.f. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 7 \nand 11.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2012. (TR at page 13 \nline 22 to page 15 line 21, and GX 1 at pages 11~12.) He is unmarried and has no \nchildren. (GX 1 at page 16.) Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to gambling. \n(TR at page 15 line 22 to page 18 line 24.) He ceased on-line gambling in 2019, and \nlast gambled in Las Vegas in March of 2022, a little more than a year prior to his \nhearing. (Id.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n1.a., and 1.c~1.e. Applicant admits to past-due debts to Creditor A totaling about \n$26,000. He has yet to address these admitted debts. These allegations are found \nagainst Applicant. \n1.b. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of about \n$7,378. He is making monthly payments of $400~$500, which is 25% of his paycheck \ntowards this admitted debt. (TR at page 23 line 4~15.) This allegation is found for \nApplicant. \n1.f. Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor F in the amount of about $2,879. \nHe avers that it has been settled and paid (TR at page 23 line 16 to page 24 line 13.) \nThis averment is supported by documentary evidence. (AppXs E and F, and GX 6 at \npage 10.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to \nfund gambling or pay gambling debts. \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness, which is attributed to gambling. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a fairly long history of \ndelinquencies, due to gambling. Although he has addressed some of his past-due \nindebtedness, Applicant still has significant gambling debts, totaling about $26,000. He \nceased his gambling only about a year prior to the issuance of his SOR, and he has not \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nnot been established. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has a distinguished history of working in the defense industry, and is \nrespected by his Lead Technician. He performs well at his job. (AppX G.) However, \nthese facts do not fully mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s outstanding \ndebts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c~1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(SOR \u00b6 1.e) The allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his \nAnswer, his SCA, his September 2020 background interview, a Defense Information \nSystem for Security (DISS) March 2021 incident report, his May 2021 response to \ninterrogatories, bankruptcy records, a court record, and credit bureau reports from June \n2021, May 2022, and May 2023. (Items 1-11) \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debts and bankruptcy to his divorce, his \nprevious minimal income, and his child support obligation. Bankruptcy records reflect \nthat he claimed approximately $182,000 total in liabilities. He indicated, during his \nbackground interview, that approximately $20,000 of the credit card debt discharged in \nhis bankruptcy was from his divorce. He also indicated that he was unable to pay seven \nto eight months of his monthly child support obligation beginning in approximately \nAugust 2017, due to minimal income. In 2019, when he switched jobs, he was also \nunable to pay several months of his child support. (Items 3-7) \nApplicant stated in his 2020 SCA, during his background interview, and in his \nresponse to interrogatories, that he began working with a debt consolidation company in \napproximately December 2019, to resolve his debts. He stated, without corroborating \ndocumentation, that he made monthly payments of $438 to the company, who was \nnegotiating with his creditors on his behalf. The May 2023 credit bureau report reflects \nthat he paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, but it continues to report as delinquent the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f.

He noted that $409 was being garnished from his wages for child support, and \nhe was allotting $960 monthly to the debt consolidation company. After his monthly \nhousehold expenses, to include payments toward his debts, he noted that his monthly \nnet remainder was $1,044. There is no information in the record about whether \nApplicant has received credit counseling. (Item 6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables knon as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and, \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts, to include a $1,257 state tax debt \nentered against him in about July 2022. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his delinquent debts. For the \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. He paid his delinquent child support in SOR \u00b6 1.e and the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. I find those allegations in his favor. However, he failed to provide \ndocumentation to corroborate his claims that he was paying the debt resolution \ncompany to resolve his remaining delinquent debts, to include the state tax lien. The \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f still appear on his most recent credit report. There is \nno indication that he has received credit counseling. In light of his chapter 7 bankruptcy \nfrom 2013, I find that Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems continue to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), \nand 20(g) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Since April 2021, he has been working for a defense contractor as an electrical foreman. (Item 2 at 12) The SOR alleges that Applicant owes approximately $29,753 in delinquent federal income taxes for tax years 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2018, and that he owes approximately $885 in delinquent state income taxes for tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n11/13/2023 \nDecision \nCurry, Marc E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has been making payments toward the satisfaction of his delinquent \nfederal income taxes for the past 18 months through a payment plan that he arranged \nwith the help of a tax preparer. Although he has not yet begun satisfying the delinquent \nstate income tax debt, I am confident that given the steady progress that he has made in \npaying the federal delinquency that he will begin making the state income tax payments \nonce the federal debt is satisfied. Under these circumstances, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. His application for a security \nclearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 22, 2022, the Department of Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency Consolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \nsecurity to grant security clearance eligibility. The DCSA CAS took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \nNational Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any adjudication made on or after June \n8, 2017. On February 4, 2023, Applicant answered the SOR. He admitted both allegations \nand requested a decision based on the evidence in the file rather than a hearing. On \nFebruary 7, 2023, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), \nsetting forth the Government\u2019s arguments against Applicant\u2019s security clearance-\nworthiness. The FORM contains four attachments, identified as Item 1 through Item 4. \nApplicant received a copy of the FORM on February 13, 2023. He was given 30 \ndays to file a response. He filed a response on March 22, 2023, whereupon the case was \nassigned to me on April 28, 2023. On October 3, 2023, I re-opened the record sua sponte \nto allow Applicant to supplement the record. Within the time allotted, he did so, submitting \none document that I marked and incorporated into the record as Item 5. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 53-year-old married man with two adult children and two adult \nstepchildren. He has a high school education. Since April 2021, he has been working for \na defense contractor as an electrical foreman. (Item 2 at 12) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes approximately $29,753 in delinquent federal \nincome taxes for tax years 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2018, and that he owes approximately \n$885 in delinquent state income taxes for tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019. (Item 1) \nApplicant did not incur these debts as a result of an inability to afford his tax debts, or due \nto procrastination. Rather, he was unaware that he owed these debts until an audit \nrevealed the shortfall in July 2021. (Item 3 at 2) He attributed the debt to tax software that \nhe used to assist with filing his tax returns that miscalculated what he owed.

Although he \nstated that he is on a payment plan to satisfy his state income tax delinquency, he \nprovided no supporting evidence. \nMoving forward, Applicant will continue to utilize an accountant to help him file his \nincome tax returns. Applicant has no issues with financial hardship, as he earns $67 per \nhour, nearly triple what he earned in his previous job. (Item 3 at 3) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s history of income tax delinquencies triggers the application of AG \u00b6 \n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201c. . . failure to pay \nannual Federal state, or local income tax as required.\u201d Applicant did not pay his tax debts \nin their entirety because of an inability to do so, or due to procrastination.

Shortly after the audit, he retained an accountant who helped him diagnose \nthe problem and who arranged a payment plan. Beginning one year before the issuance \nof the SOR, and continuing through the present, Applicant has reduced the income tax \ndebt by approximately $12,800. Under these circumstances, the following mitigating \nconditions apply under AG \u00b6 20: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control . . . and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances; \n(c) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not produce evidence that he has satisfied the state tax debt \ndelinquency. However, given that progress he has made in reducing the federal income \ntax delinquency, and the nominal amount of the state income tax debt remaining, I \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s contention that he is paying state income tax debt through a \npayment plan is credible. In conclusion, Applicant has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe good-faith nature of the mistake that caused Applicant to underpay his tax \ndebts for the years in question, together with the steps he has taken to remedy the \nproblem and satisfy the delinquencies make the possibility of recurrence or continuation \nof the tax problem minimal. Considering this case in context of the whole-person factors, \nI conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n4 \n\n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is GRANTED. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

The Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailed security \nconcerns under Guideline J, criminal conduct. \nOn December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense, Intelligence and Security \n(USD (I&S)) Ronald S.

As a result of Under Secretary Moultrie\u2019s Memorandum, he was \ngiven the opportunity to receive the process set forth in DOD Directive 5220.6. On \nJanuary 19, 2023, Applicant elected that process.

(Hearing \nExhibit 1) \nThe case was assigned to me on January 10, 2023. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on January 18, 2023, scheduling the hearing for February 14, 2023, via Microsoft \nTeams. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 9. Applicant and seven witnesses testified on his behalf. He offered Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through FF. There were no objections, and all exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. HE II is the Government\u2019s discovery letter. Post-hearing, both parties provided \nemails and copies of pertinent state statutes.

After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. He graduated high school in 2000. He served in the \nmilitary from July 2000 to November 2008 and was honorably discharged. He is a \ndisabled veteran. He earned an associate degree in 2011, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013, \na master\u2019s degree in 2015, and a second master\u2019s degree in 2016. He began working for \nthe federal government in 2010 and has been employed in his current position since \nSeptember 2019. He has never married. He has a 23-year-old son from a previous \nrelationship and a 15-year-old daughter (DT) from a previous relationship. He has held a \nsecurity clearance since approximately 2003. (Transcript (Tr.) at 9-27, 42; AE G, N, O, P) \nApplicant and the mother (M) of DT have joint custody. He has complied with \nproviding child support for this daughter and has maintained a relationship with her \nthrough his visitation rights. (Tr. 23-25) \nApplicant testified that in 2017, DT was using her cell phone while visiting him and \nwas videotaping him and his family. He said that she videotaped him napping and going \ninto the bathroom. He believed that M had asked her to spy on him by videotaping him. \nHe said he called M and told her to stop making those requests of DT. He testified that \nhe told DT that she was no longer permitted to bring a cell phone to his house during her \nvisitation. (Tr. 28, 41, 58-60) \nIn May 2020, Applicant picked up his daughter from a designated location. Due to \nthe acrimonious relationship between Applicant and M, a neutral place was arranged. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant planned to take DT to his parent\u2019s house. It was his birthday. After she entered \nthe car, they began arguing because DT did not want to stay with him and wanted to \nremain with M. He testified that DT had an uncooperative attitude, and he pulled the car \nover to the side of the road and pulled her out of the car. He said that he did not want DT \nto destroy his birthday. He testified that he was getting ready to call M to ask her to come \nand pick up DT, when he noticed she had a cell phone and ear pods. She was not using \nthem. He said he told DT that she was not permitted to have a cell phone when she \nvisited. They got back in the car. While driving to his parent\u2019s house, he said he told DT \nhe was going to spank her with a belt for having her cell phone with her, which was \nforbidden. She was 12 years old at the time. (Tr. 28, 49-55, 61-62, 91-92) \nApplicant testified that when he and DT arrived at his parent\u2019s house, they got out \nof the car, and he took off his leather belt and hit her four to five times. He testified that \nhe \u201cpopped\u201d her and when he struck her, she jumped. (Tr. 56) She was wearing shorts \nand he hit her on her buttocks and bare legs. She attempted to run away, and he grabbed \nher by the arm. He admitted that his blows left welt marks on her body. After DT was \nstruck, M drove up in her car and DT ran to her car and got in it. Applicant believes DT \ntexted M after he told her he was going to hit her. Applicant said that M said, \u201cyou beat \nher ass.\u201d (Tr. 30) Applicant told M she was not supposed to be there according to the \nchild custody order. (Tr. 28-31, 37, 54-58, 67-69) \nApplicant explained that if he let DT get away with disobeying him that her conduct \nwould escalate. He said his thought process was \u201cI\u2019m going to nip this in the bud as quick \nas possible.\u201d (Tr. 31) He explained that he hit her because he had not given her \npermission to have a cell phone when she was visiting. About a month prior to this \nincident, DT had asked Applicant if she could bring her cell phone with her when visiting \nhim, and he said he had to be able to trust her. At that time, he still did not trust her. He \ntestified when he struck her with the belt it was to discipline her and make her understand \nthe importance of complying with rules. When asked why he used a belt, he said \u201cI didn\u2019t \nwant to pop her with my hand because I thought that would be more of an assault, and \nthe way I grew up, you know, the belt was a proper form of discipline.\u201d (Tr. 94) His \ndaughter at the time was approximately five feet two inches tall and 120 pounds. He is \nsix feet tall and 238 pounds. He said the marks he left on her skin \u201cwere just welts.\u201d He \nsaid when he was growing up the preferred method of disciplining was using a belt. (Tr. \n30, 37-42, 57-63, 88-98) \nWhen questioned if Applicant had previously hit DT with a belt, he said that on one \noccasion in 2019, he had \u201cpopped\u201d her about three times with a belt when she had taken \nhis debit card without permission and purchased a math game. He testified that he \npreviously had conversations with her about following rules and regulations to succeed in \nlife. He admitted that DT began saying she did not want to be with him sometime after the \n2019 spanking, but he really believed that M was influencing DT. He also attributed DT \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot wanting to be with him due to his rules on the use of cell phones.1  (Tr. 40, 47-53, 62-\n64, 67-69) \nApplicant testified that after he hit DT, he went to the courthouse to file a complaint \nof \u201cparental interference,\u201d presumably against M. He was detained by the police and \ninvestigated on the charge of child abuse. He said he was shocked by the allegation. (Tr. \n31-32) \nOn the day of the incident, M filed a petition for protection from abuse against \nApplicant. The petition was granted by the court, enjoining Applicant from threatening to \ncommit or committing acts of abuse against M and DT. In addition, he was restrained and \nenjoined from annoying, harassing, stalking, threatening, and engaging in conduct that \nwould place M and DT in reasonable fear of bodily harm. He was enjoined from contacting \neither M or DT. Visitation by Applicant was denied. The order was granted on June 2, \n2020. On June 22, 2020, the order was dismissed because the terms of Applicant\u2019s bond \nprecluded him from having contact with the DT. (GE 6) \nApplicant reported to his command that he was arrested on May 24, 2020, for \nwillful abuse of child. He reported that he had custody of his child, and she had stolen his \ncredit card and made unauthorized charges. He was arrested on the day of the incident \nand charged with a Class C felony for willful abuse of a child, which carries a sentence if \nconvicted of no less than one year and one day and no more than ten years, if there are \nno prior offenses. The command\u2019s report did not mention the cell phone incident and that \nApplicant had hit the child with a belt. (Tr. 70-73; GE 3) \nA forensic exam report from the state stated there were injuries to DT\u2019s upper and \nlower extremities and buttocks. The report reflected the different parts of her body where \nthe injuries were specifically located, the size of each injury, and the placement. Applicant \nacknowledged DT had injuries on her body. He stated that she tried to run away when he \nwas spanking her, and he grabbed her. Applicant testified that the forensic report did not \nreport that DT had mental health issues. He testified that DT had a fight with her maternal \ngrandmother earlier in the day. (AE CC) \nOn June 30, 2020, the state department of human resources sent Applicant a letter \nstating it had investigated the allegation of child abuse. Its investigation found reasonable \ncause to believe the reports were true, using the standard that there is more credible \nevidence than not, based on the professional judgment of the social worker that child \nabuse or neglect occurred. The assessment revealed that there was evidence of physical \nabuse, as noted by cuts and bruises on DT\u2019s legs and arm. The disposition was based \non credible evidence from the observation of the investigative worker and other collateral \ncontacts. The letter informed Applicant that he had a right to have the written report \nreviewed by an independent panel. Applicant exercised his right and the independent \npanel concurred with the original findings of abuse. (Tr. 75-77; GE 4) \n1 Any derogatory information that was not alleged will not be considered for disqualifying purposes. It may \nbe considered in the application of mitigating conditions, making a credibility determination, and in the \nwhole-person analysis. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn July 1, 2022, Applicant was indicted by a Grand Jury for torture, willful abuse, \ncruelly beating, or otherwise willfully maltreating a child under the age of 18 to wit: DT by \n\u201cwhipping her on the back with a belt and hitting her chest\u201d, in violation of the state statute. \n(Tr. 76-77; GE 5) \nOn November 30, 2022, Applicant\u2019s criminal defense attorney advised him to \naccept a plea agreement, which reduced the felony to a misdemeanor of reckless \nendangerment and/or harassment. His attorney explained that a potential conviction for \nchild abuse would severely and negatively affect his life and career. Applicant explained \nto her that his intent was to discipline his child. He did not believe he had physically \nabused her. He stated if she had been cruelly beaten, she should have gone to the \nhospital. He did not want to plead guilty to the lesser charge. (Tr. 32-33, 77-78; AE U, V) \nOn December 1, 2022, Applicant voluntarily accepted a plea agreement to have \nthe felony charge reduced to the misdemeanor of harassment. He was represented by \nhis criminal defense attorney. His plea of guilty was accepted and the court adjudicated \nhis guilt. He was given a three-month jail sentence that was suspended for two years and \nwas placed on probation for two years. He was also given a fine and required to pay court \ncosts. (GE 5) \nOn December 23, 2022, Applicant filed a motion to set aside his guilty plea. The \nmotion was granted on February 9, 2023, and the plea agreement was set aside. The \nplea to harassment was removed and the original case has been reinstated, which means \nthe pending charge of child abuse is a felony. As of February 13, 2023, a trial by jury date \nhad not been scheduled. Applicant testified that when he entered into the plea agreement \nhe did not disagree with the facts, but he was unaware of the collateral consequences, \nnamely, that he would not be permitted to carry a gun, which would jeopardize his ability \nto maintain a part-time job he had as a security officer and his security clearance. (Tr. 33-\n37, 77-81; GE 9; AE S, T, FF) (AE W, X, Y, BB are various court documents associated \nwith the pending case.) \nApplicant testified that as a parent he is permitted to discipline his child and spank \nher. He believes his actions were not cruel because she did not require hospitalization. \nHe testified that they were \u201cjust welts.\u201d (Tr. 97) He admitted that he was arguing with DT \nand the welts from him striking her with a belt could be observed on her body. When \nasked if he would \u201cspank\u201d her again, he said no because she is older, and he is cognizant \nof the collateral implications that could transpired. He does not believe he willfully and \ncruelly abused his daughter. He did not believe he went too far in disciplining her. \nApplicant stated that his daughter has mental health issues and has a propensity to defy \nhim to aggravate and get a rise out of him. He wants her to follow rules and not assume \nthat she can evade them and the law. (Tr. 37, 70-74, 82-83; 93-98; AE AA, EE) \nApplicant has participated in therapy from December 2018 to 2022 for depression, \npost-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety. He saw a therapist every three to four \nmonths. Since May 2022, he has seen a therapist every six months. His last visit was in \nNovember or December 2022. He takes medication for anxiety.

He provided a document showing that in December \n2020, he signed up for an online six-week parenting class. (Tr. 83-87; AE H, Z) \nApplicant provided numerous letters of reference and character letters. He \nprovided performance evaluations from 2018 through 2022; and a letter of \ncommendation; and various military documents and evaluations. He has helped fellow \nveterans navigate through the various programs offered and helped them secure \nemployment. He is a valued coworker. His evaluations reflect that he is consistently rated \n\u201cfully successful\u201d or \u201coutstanding.\u201d (AE A through M, Q, R) \nSeven witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf and were aware of the pending \ncharges against him. His pastor believes Applicant is committed to his faith and would not \nintentionally harm his child. Supervisors and coworkers testified that he does outstanding \nwork. He is accountable and trustworthy and a person of integrity. They have not \nobserved him being violent, angry, or aggressive. One witness is from the same \nneighborhood where Applicant grew up, He stated that it was a \u201crough\u201d area and parents \nwere strict with discipline to keep their children from getting into trouble. One witness \ntestified that as a paralyzed disabled veteran, he was unaware of benefits he was entitled \nto receive, and Applicant helped him navigate the process and apply for jobs. On one \noccasion, this witness was distraught and suicidal, and Applicant visited him in the middle \nof the night to help him. None of the witnesses have concerns about him holding a security \nclearance. (Tr. 101-151) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer he provided a personal statement, court documents and \nother documents in mitigation. I have considered all of them. (Answer) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is potentially \napplicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant is charged with a Class C felony for torture, willful abuse, cruelly beating, \nor otherwise willfully maltreating a child under the age of 18 to wit: DT. There is substantial \nevidence that he intentionally struck his daughter with a belt on her buttocks and bare \nlegs, which left welts on her body. The above disqualifying condition applies. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant admitted that in May 2020 he used a belt to strike his daughter on the \nlegs and buttocks leaving welts on her body. Applicant is charged with a felony for child \nabuse that has not yet been adjudicated and is pending in a criminal court. Despite that \ncharge and a finding by the state human resource center of a finding of abuse, which he \nappealed and was affirmed by an independent panel, he continues to assert that his \nconduct was not inappropriate, cruel, or criminal. He believes his decision to discipline \nhis daughter harshly with a belt is an acceptable method of punishment He candidly \nadmitted he had previously struck her with his belt after she used his debit card without \nauthorization. Based on these two incidents and his unwavering belief that his conduct is \nacceptable, I cannot find that future similar conduct is unlikely to recur. His conduct casts \ndoubt on his good judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. \nApplicant has not had contact with his daughter since the May 2020 incident. He \nprovided character evidence and documented his good employment record and \ncommunity involvement. I have considered all of it but conclude that it is insufficient to \novercome his actions and failure to take responsibility for his conduct. There is insufficient \nevidence of rehabilitation to fully apply AG \u00b6 32(b). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline J in my whole-person analysis. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s military service and character evidence. I have \nweighed the favorable and unfavorable evidence. A security clearance determination \nhearing is not a criminal court and is not required to adhere to the higher standard of \nproof. Any doubt about anyone being considered for national security eligibility will be \nresolved in favor of the national security. I have carefully considered all the factors in AG \n\u00b6 2. Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with serious questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information and SCI is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He earned a high school diploma in 1997 and a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 2022. He has been married since September 2014. He has two children, ages 12 and \n9. He enlisted in the Marines in 1997 and was honorably discharged in 2002. He has \nheld a security clearance since 1997. (Tr. 17-20, 45-46, 93-94; Answer; GE 1) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s five delinquent financial \naccounts totaling approximately $42,000. These delinquent accounts consisted of a \npersonal loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c), an automobile loan (SOR \n\u00b6 1.d), and a telecommunications debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He denied all the SOR allegations \nbecause he claimed he was in the process of resolving them and they should not result \nin the loss of his security clearance. Notwithstanding his denials, the SOR allegations \nare established by the Government\u2019s 2021, 2022, and two 2023 credit reports. (Answer; \nGE 1-5; AE A-H) \nBetween December 2022 and May 2023, Applicant resolved all the accounts in \nthe SOR. He fell behind on the SOR accounts in about 2015 because his wife, with \nwhom he shared household expenses, was laid off. From 2012 until about 2022, she \nalso had multiple serious health problems, including mental health issues, that \ncontributed to her inability to find income comparable to what she earned before she \nlost her job. In December 2022, Applicant contacted a debt consolidation company to \nhelp him resolve the SOR debts. He then contacted the creditors of the SOR debts. He \nmade payment arrangements with the creditors and satisfied these debts for less than \nthe full balance after he received the SOR. He settled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b  \nafter the creditor filed legal proceedings against him. (Tr. 20-32, 46-60, 76, 79-84, 93-\n100; Answer; GE 2-5; AE A-I)   \nApplicant claimed that he thought he was beginning to regain his financial footing \nin about late 2018, but he concentrated on saving money and paying other, \nnondelinquent debts, until the end of 2022. His wife\u2019s mental health also informed the \ntiming of when he addressed his SOR debts. He admitted that the possibility of losing \nhis security clearance was a motivating factor in resolving his SOR debts. I observed his \nand his wife\u2019s demeanor while they testified and found their testimony, including \nstatements about the resolution of his SOR debts, to be credible. Their willingness to \nopenly testify about derogatory information bolstered their credibility. Applicant also \nprovided documentary corroboration of the resolution of the SOR debts. (Tr. 20-32, 46-\n60, 76, 79-84, 93-100; Answer; GE 2-5; AE A-I)  \nOver the last ten years, Applicant has earned at least $65,000, annually. He also \nhas received about $1,900 in monthly military disability benefits. His wife has earned \nabout $65,000 per year since mid-2018, when she regained full-time employment. She \nexpects to earn more when she finishes human resource (HR) and leadership training \nwith her employer. She also expects that her new position in HR will be more stable and \ntransferable than her current and past positions that were reliant on the economic health \nof the oil and gas industry.

Applicant and his wife sit down together \nmonthly to pay the bills, and they have established a written budget. Their budget \nshows that after paying their expenses they have a monthly surplus of about $3,700. \nThey have several non-delinquent credit cards and non-delinquent revolving loan \naccounts on which they maintain a balance. Applicant has completed some credit \ncounseling courses through a non-profit organization. He and his wife both testified that \nhe is able to pay his bills on time and that they had about $10,000 combined in three \nbank accounts. Prior to resolving the SOR debts, they had about $20,000 in those bank \naccounts. Applicant also has a retirement account with a balance of about $87,000. \nNeither he nor his wife currently have any delinquent financial accounts. (Tr. 33-46, 59-\n88, 93-106; Answer; GE 4, 5; AE E, J) \nWhile Applicant was in the Marines, he earned several commendations and \nmedals. He has also received several awards at work. His colleagues, friends, and \nfamily have written character-reference letters advocating that he be awarded a security \nclearance and attesting to his good character, trustworthiness, reliability, and patriotism. \nHis wife also testified to his reliability, honesty, and strength of character.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by his wife\u2019s unemployment and health \nissues. These conditions were largely beyond his control. In response, he acted \nresponsibly by hiring a debt consolidation company, contacting creditors, making \npayment arrangements, and complying with those arrangements. While he began \ncontacting creditors and paying his SOR debts after he received the SOR, he contacted \nthe debt consolidation company prior to receiving it. There is evidence that he could \nhave begun resolving his SOR debts sooner, but he and his wife credibly testified that \ntheir desire to save money and her mental health issues largely precluded them from \nresolving the SOR debts until they did. He has provided sufficient evidence that his \nefforts to repay overdue creditors were made in good faith. \nApplicant has undergone financial counseling. His current financial situation, \nincluding his and his wife\u2019s income, substantial savings, their job stability, and lack of \ndelinquent debts, are sufficient to show that his financial issues are unlikely to recur and \ndo not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. All the \nabove mitigating conditions apply. The financial considerations security concerns are \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.

He completed a security clearance application, his first, in October 2021. \nIn response to Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, he disclosed using \nmarijuana between June 1998 and October 2021. He explained that he used the drug \n\u201crecreationally, sometimes for a few days in a week.\u201d He also admitted that he would \nabstain from the drug for a month or months at a time. He indicated his intent to \ncontinue using the drug to alleviate work-related stress and in social settings with his \nfriends. (GE 3) \nIn a February 2022 subject interview, Applicant confirmed the disclosures in his \nsecurity clearance application, that he began using marijuana in June 1998, and that he \nintended to continue using the drug. He also confirmed that his use was ongoing at the \ntime of the interview, reporting that he smoked a marijuana cigarette once or twice a \nweek to relieve stress. The drug is legal in his state of residency, and he reported \npurchasing it from state-sanctioned dispensaries. Applicant explained to the investigator \nthat had not experienced negative consequences from his marijuana use. He did not \nbelieve that doing so had any negative affects his personal or professional life. (GE 4) \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories signed March 22, 2023, Applicant provided \nadditional information about his marijuana use. He confirmed he used marijuana once \nor twice a week through March 2023, and that he purchased the drug on multiple \noccasions between March 2001 and July 2022. However, he claimed that he first used \nmarijuana in high school in approximately 1999 or 2000, not in June 1998 while in \nmiddle school, as he previously reported. Contrary to his previous statements, he stated \nthat he intended to abstain from future marijuana use because continued use limited his \ncareer advancement opportunities. (GE 4) \nApplicant has not been referred to substance abuse counseling by a court, his \nfamily, or any medical professional. He does not consider his use of marijuana to be a \npotential source of vulnerability because his wife is aware of it. (GE 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis  \nThe record contains evidence to support the Government\u2019s prima facie case that \nApplicant engaged in disqualifying conduct under the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse guideline. He did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate any of the alleged \nconcerns. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted using marijuana from at least 1998 to at least March 2023 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) as well as purchasing the drug on numerous occasions between March \n2001 and July 2022. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) The illegal use of controlled substances can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions about \na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 25) \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 26(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nNone of the guideline\u2019s mitigating conditions apply. The legalization of marijuana \nuse or purchase from state-sanctioned dispensaries in Applicant\u2019s state of residency \ndoes not alter federal law or existing National Security Guidelines. No state can \nauthorize the violation of federal law. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use violates the Controlled \nSubstances Act, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Under the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA), as amended, federal \nagencies remain prohibited from granting a security clearance to an unlawful user of a \ncontrolled substance. (See Director of National Intelligence Memorandum, Adherence to \nFederal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, dated November 17, 2014). The Agency \nclarified its guidance concerning marijuana for individuals eligible to access classified \ninformation in a memorandum dated December 21, 2021: \nWith regard to the first topic, agencies are instructed that prior recreational \nmarijuana use by an individual may be relevant to adjudications but not \ndeterminative. The [Security Executive Agent (SecEA)] has provided \ndirection in SEAD 4 to agencies that requires them to use a \"whole-person \nconcept.\" This requires adjudicators to carefully weigh a number of \nvariables in an individual's life to determine whether that individual's \nbehavior raises a security concern, if at all, and whether that concern has \nbeen mitigated such that the individual may now receive a favorable \nadjudicative determination. Relevant mitigations include, but are not \nlimited to, frequency of use and. whether the individual can demonstrate \nthat future use is unlikely to recur, including by signing an attestation or \nother such appropriate litigation. Additionally, in light of the long-standing- \nfederal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use while occupying a \nsensitive position or holding a security clearance, agencies are \nencouraged to advise prospective national security workforce employees \nthat they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon initiation of the \nnational security vetting process, which commences once the individual \nsigns the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant has a 25-year history of recreational marijuana use.

He continued \nto use marijuana for almost two years after applying for access to classified information. \nHe reported to the Government in two official statements that he that he intended to use \nthe drug in the future. Given his recent and extensive drug use and his failure to \ndemonstrate a sufficient period of abstinence, he has not produced sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the alleged security concerns. \nWhole-person Concept \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s current security \nworthiness. This decision is not changed by a consideration of the facts under the \nwhole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant failed to meet his burdens of \npersuasion and production to mitigate the alleged concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Lynch, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/31/2023 \nDecision \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \nBased on the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is \ninsufficient to overcome the security concerns remaining under drug involvement \n(Guideline H) criminal conduct (Guideline J). Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 4, 2022, Department of Defense Consolidation Adjudication \nServices (DoD CAS) revoked Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \nand Applicant appealed that revocation under the provisions of DoDM 5200.02. On \nDecember 2, 2022, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence & Security), Ronald S. \nMoultrie issued a memorandum indicating that any individual whose clearance eligibility \nwas revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and December 2, 2022, shall be \nafforded the opportunity to pursue the Defense of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nhearing and appeals process set forth in DoD Directive 5220.6. As a result of Under \nSecretary Moultrie\u2019s Memo, Applicant was given an opportunity to receive the process \nset forth in DoD Directive 5220.6, and Applicant elected that process on February 5, \n1 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n2023. Although he is not currently employed in a position requiring access to classified \ninformation, jurisdiction continues under Paragraph 4.4 of the Directive under these \nunique circumstances. \nOn January 19, 2023, after this case was assigned to me, a notice of hearing \nwas sent to Applicant scheduling a hearing on February 8, 2023, via Microsoft Teams \nTeleconference Services; the hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s 13 \nexhibits (GE) 1-13 were admitted in evidence. Applicant\u2019s objections to GE 8 and 13, \nand the Motion in Limine, will be discussed below in Rulings on Evidence. The motion is \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. Applicant\u2019s four exhibits (AE) A-D have been \nremarked as five exhibits (AE A-E) to account for the one-page February 2022 court \nrecord (AE D) that was overlooked. AE A-E were admitted without objection. On \nFebruary 21, 2023, Applicant provided post-hearing documentation (AE F) consisting of \na record of five urinalysis tests and results processed between October 2021 and July \n2022, which were entered into evidence without objection. I have also marked and \nentered into evidence sua sponte AE G, Applicant\u2019s one-page email dated February 5, \n2023, providing his response to the Motion in Limine and statements regarding \nfentanyl\u2019s window of detection in the human body. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on February 17, 2023. \nRulings on Evidence \nApplicant objected to GE 8 (Arrest report for domestic assault, dated February \n24, 2022, resulting in \u00b6 2.a protection order) because he did not confess to an \u201cassault\u201d \nin describing how he made contact with his four-year-old child. Instead, he \ncharacterized his conduct as disciplining his child. (Tr. 21) The arresting officer testified \nat the February 2023 security clearance hearing that on February 24, 2022, the day of \nthe arrest, Applicant explained that he was disciplining the child, and that is how the \nmarks appeared on the child\u2019s body. (Tr. 36-37) Applicant\u2019s objection is overruled. \nApplicant also objected to GE 13, an email statement by the same officer who \narrested him in February 2022, whom Applicant encountered outside a courtroom on \nApril 7, 2022. (Though there is no direct evidence indicating that the encounter related \nto Applicant\u2019s pending domestic assault or protection order (PO) cases, I find that the \ninteraction demonstrated Applicant\u2019s hostile attitude toward the arresting officer.) This \nofficer testified about their April 7, 2022 encounter outside a courtroom. Applicant\u2019s \nobjection to GE 13 (Tr. 24) and the potential testimony of the arresting officer (Tr. 32) \nwas based his belief that the officer\u2019s testimony would not be objective because the \nofficer was under investigation by internal affairs division of his employer. (Tr. 32) I \noverruled Applicant\u2019s objections and advised him he could cross examine the officer to \ntest the veracity of his testimony. (Tr. 24, 33) \nOn February 4, 2023, the Government filed a Motion in Limine to Exclude the \nPolygraph Report, an exhibit (AE B) submitted by Applicant on December 23, 2022. (Tr. \n25) The primary reason for the motion was that polygraph results are inadmissible in \nDOHA proceedings. ISCR Case No. 15-07539 at 5, note 3 (App. Bd.

Fields, 459 U.S. \n42, 48 n.* (1982) However, statements made during the polygraph examination are \nadmissible. Even if the results were admissible, Department Counsel emphasized that \nApplicant\u2019s responses to the three questions asked by the polygrapher were structured \nincorrectly as the questions were focused on Applicant\u2019s knowing use of fentanyl rather \nthan his knowing use of a controlled substance. I rule that the polygrapher\u2019s results \nassessment, the last entry on page 1, his opinions, pages 6 through 8, and the \npolygrapher\u2019s background, including how the report should be handled, page 9, will not \nbe considered.

January 20, 2006) See also Tr. \n25-30.  \nSummary of SOR Allegations \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) \nAt the outset, since Applicant did not provide a response to the SOR, his \nresponses will be based on his testimony and the exhibits he submitted at and after the \nhearing. SOR 1.a - Drug test results dated November 2, 2021, disclosed that Applicant \ntested positive for fentanyl, a Schedule II drug, during a urinalysis drug test conducted \non October 12, 2021. Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use occurred after he was determined to \nbe eligible for a secret security clearance on February 11, 2013. Applicant admitted he \ntook the urinalysis test, but the positive test result showing the presence of fentanyl was \nwrong, as he had not ingested the drug. (Tr. 54) He believed the positive test results for \nfentanyl represented a testing error by the laboratory. (AE A ) \nSOR 1.b - On an SF Form 86 (security clearance application), signed by \nApplicant on December 2, 2009, he disclosed under Section 22 (police record) that he \nwas arrested in July 2009 for marijuana possession and use. Under Section 23 (illegal \nuse of drugs or drug activity), Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana about six \ntimes from May to July 2009. He admitted that he was arrested in July 2009 for \nmarijuana possession and that he used marijuana up to six times between May and July \n2009. (GE 1 at 28-31; Tr. 52) \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)  \nSOR 2.a (Criminal Conduct) \u2013 An operations center continuous evaluation \nreport, dated May 3, 2022, disclosed that Applicant received a protection order (PO) \nfrom a city police department on March 11, 2022. The PO was scheduled to expire on \nMarch 11, 2023. Applicant admitted this allegation. \nSOR 2.b - Drug test results dated November 2, 2021, disclosed that Applicant \ntested positive for fentanyl, a Schedule II drug, during a urinalysis conducted on \nOctober 12, 2021. Applicant\u2019s denial of Guideline H also applies to Guideline J. \nSOR 2.c - In Applicant\u2019s SF 86, dated December 2, 2009, he disclosed under \nSection 22 (Police Record) an arrest for marijuana in July 2009. Under Section 23 \n3 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Illegal Use of Drugs), he disclosed that he used marijuana about six times from May to \nhis arrest in July 2009 for possession of marijuana. Applicant\u2019s drug abuse in the 2009 \ntime period also constitutes criminal conduct. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 34 years old and has three of his five children from his estranged \nwife who he filed for divorce from in December 2021. (Tr. 50-51) He has a high school \ndiploma (GE 1 at 10), and attended college briefly in 2008. He received vocational \ntraining as a hydraulic repair technician and was employed as a structural mechanic in \nthe United States Navy (USN) since February 2010. He received his security clearance \nin February 2013. He is scheduled to resume his college education by enrolling for the \nspring semester of 2023, and is pursuing an associate degree in social science. (Tr. 6-\n7) Applicant is currently unemployed. (Tr. 6-7, 51-52) \nSOR 1.a (Drug Involvement) \u2013 On October 12, 2021, Applicant submitted to a \nurinalysis test. His drug test results dated November 2, 2021 registered positive for \nfentanyl, a Schedule II drug. (GE 2 at 1) Email correspondence dated November 3, \n2021, provided by Applicant\u2019s security management office indicated that none of his \nprescription records would generate positive results for fentanyl. (AE 2 at 2-3) His other \nurinalysis test results in 2022 were negative except for the November 2, 2021 result. \n(GE 2 at 4) Documentation shows the chain of custody in the processing and handling \nof the urine sample from October 12, 2021 through October 20, 2021. The date the test \nresults were processed by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System was October \n25, 2021. The urine specimen was kept in frozen storage until February 2023. (GE 2 at \n5-9; GE 9 at 5-6; AE F at 2) \nWhen Applicant took the urinalysis on October 12, 2021, he was assigned to \nthe Norfolk Naval Hospital awaiting a medical separation from the Navy. His job was to \ncheck the credentials of people entering the hospital. Because of a compromised \nimmune system, he had to stop working in that position. (Tr. 52-53) \nAfter receiving the positive urine test result on November 3, 2021, Applicant \nindicated that he provided another urine sample for a second test on the same day or \nthe next day. Common sense should have convinced Applicant to seek a retest of the \noriginal urine sample. The results of the second test of the other sample were negative, \nbut he did not submit the documented results of the test. If the results had been \npositive, Applicant surmised he would have been informed because fentanyl only \nremains in the system for about 72 hours. (Tr. 66-70; AE G) No documentation \naddressing the retest, or a blood test administered by the drug and alcohol awareness \nprogram manager about a week later, was submitted. \nAfter receiving the positive test results on November 2, 2021, Applicant \nretained a polygrapher and took a polygraph test on November 23, 2021 (AE B at 1), to \nverify the accuracy of his positive urine test results dated November 2, 2021. His \npurpose for taking the test was to support his claim that he did not knowingly take the \n4 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfentanyl drug. In his responses to three questions posed by the polygrapher during the \nexamination, he indicated that he did not knowingly ingest the drug or any narcotic \nduring the month of October 2021. \nOn November 24, 2021, Applicant underwent a hair follicle test where a sample \nof his underarm hair was examined. Applicant was bald when he was arrested in \nFebruary 2022 (GE 8 at 4), and at the security clearance hearing in February 2023. \nBetween November 24 and December 3, 2021, the hair was tested and determined to \nbe negative for fentanyl. The test was conducted by a laboratory, and the results were \nreviewed and certified. (AE C) No additional information, i.e., chain of custody evidence \nto ensure the integrity of the hair sample, was submitted regarding the hair follicle test. \nThere is no indication that Applicant\u2019s photograph was taken at the time the hair was \nremoved. \nOn September 15, 2022, an administrative separation board of the USN met to \nhear Applicant\u2019s case and then make findings and render a recommendation of whether \nto retain, separate, or suspend Applicant. Among the five exhibits presented by the \ngovernment was a positive urinalysis and technical review of the analysis. By a \npreponderance of the evidence, the board found the evidence did not support \nApplicant\u2019s separation from the service. A transcript of the proceedings, as well as the \nboard\u2019s findings and recommendations, were not included in the exhibit. (GE 9 at 1-6) \nSOR 1.b \u2013 Applicant signed an SF 86 (security clearance application) on \nDecember 2, 2009. Under Section 22 (Police Record), he disclosed that he was \narrested in July 2009 for marijuana possession. Under Section 23 (Illegal use of Drugs), \nhe disclosed that he used marijuana up to six times between May and July 2009. He \nwas charged with possession of marijuana in July 2009. (GE 1 at 29-30; Tr. 52, 54-56) \nSOR 2.a (Criminal Conduct) \u2013 A continuous evaluation report, dated May 3, \n2022, indicates that Applicant received a protection order (PO) by a judge in a domestic \nrelations court in Norfolk, Virginia on March 11, 2022, after a hearing. The PO was set \nto expire on March 11, 2023. (GE 3) Applicant testified that his wife informed the \ndomestic relations judge at the March 2022 PO hearing that she feared for the safety of \nthe children, and she stated to the police that she feared for her own safety. Applicant \ndid not believe that his wife told the judge that he had assaulted her. The PO was \nissued by the juvenile judge who determined that Applicant excessively disciplined his \nchildren. Applicant appealed the March 2022 PO, and a hearing was scheduled for April \n28, 2022 to determine whether the PO should be modified. When he did not appear for \nthe hearing, the original protection order was continued to \u201cremain in full force and \neffect\u201d until the March 2023 expiration date. (GE 10); Tr. 60-61) \nAt the time of the February 2023 security clearance hearing, Applicant was \naware that under the continuing restrictions of the PO, he still could not have contact \nwith his estranged wife or children. Applicant\u2019s last contact with his wife and children \nwas in February 2022.

The officer who participated in the February 2022 domestic assault \narrest, the PO, and the April 7, 2022 encounter outside the domestic relations \ncourtroom, also testified at the February 2023 security clearance hearing. (GE 8 at 7-12, \n10; Tr. 30-31) The arresting officer testified that he has been on the city police force for \nthree years. On February 24, 2022, he was dispatched to Applicant\u2019s family residence \nwhere the alleged assault occurred. He observed certain minor injuries on one of \nApplicant\u2019s children, a four-year-old child. Applicant\u2019s wife informed the officer that \nApplicant physically assaulted the child. Applicant stated to the officer that he was \ndisciplining the child and explained that was how the marks appeared on the child\u2019s \nbody. While the officer did not remember whether Applicant had consumed alcohol at \nthe time he imposed the discipline, the information is noted in his report. Applicant was \narrested for domestic assault and battery. (GE 4; GE 8 at 14; Tr. 35-37; AE D) \nThe officer testified that, as a result of a bench trial, the juvenile court judge \nfound Applicant guilty of domestic assault of a family member. (Tr. 39) Applicant \nappealed the verdict to the Circuit Court and was found not guilty and the case was \ndismissed in November 2022. The court records show the case was dismissed. (GE 4; \nTr. 37-39; AE D) \nThe arresting officer in the domestic assault case testified that he had an \nencounter with Applicant on April 7, 2022. (GE 13, email dated January 31, 2023) The \nexhibit indicates that while waiting outside the domestic relations courtroom, Applicant \ndirected some vulgar language at the officer, the police profession in general, and made \nthreatening statements to the officer. The officer had done nothing to provoke the \nantagonistic behavior by Applicant. In recounting the events during the February 2023 \nhearing, the officer testified he was walking down the hall towards the courtroom, when \nApplicant stopped him. The officer indicated that Applicant used profane language in the \nmanner described in GE 13. Applicant objected to the officer\u2019s testimony claiming that \nthe officer\u2019s account of the events outside the courtroom never occurred. Later during \nthe officer\u2019s testimony indicating that he had done nothing to provoke the hostility, \nApplicant accused the officer of having sexual relations with Applicant\u2019s wife. (Tr. 40-41) \nOn cross-examination, Applicant asked the officer whether he was aware of what \nconstitutes domestic assault of a child in the state where Applicant was arrested. The \nofficer explained that because he was only \u201cmildly aware\u201d of the domestic assault of a \nchild, he contacted the special crimes detectives before the arrest. (Tr. 42) The officer \nconfirmed that in November 2022, Applicant was ultimately found not guilty of the \ndomestic assault.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n7 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession \nof drug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nSOR 1.a (Drug Involvement) - Applicant\u2019s positive urinalysis test results in \nNovember 2021 activate AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(b). The evidence also triggers AG \u00b6 25 (c) \nbecause misusing an illegal drug involves possession of the drug. Applicant\u2019s misuse of \nthe drug in October 2021 while possessing a security clearance invokes AG \u00b6 25 (g). \nIn denying he used fentanyl, Applicant claims the positive urinalysis was the \nresult of a testing error during the processing of the urine sample. Significantly he \nprovided no evidence demonstrating that the test was performed incorrectly or \nunsatisfactorily. \n8 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana up to six times between May 2009and his arrest in \nJuly 2009 for marijuana possession, falls within the parameters of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25 (a) and 25 \n(c). \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1)  disassociation from drug-using associates contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nSOR 1.a - Applicant\u2019s positive fentanyl test results occurred less than two years \nago. There is no evidence of the duration or circumstances of his use of the drug. His \nuse of fentanyl while holding a security clearance raises concern about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. AG \u00b6 26(b) does not \napply because Applicant did not acknowledge his fentanyl use and provided no \nevidence to establish AG\u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), or 26(b)(3). \nApplicant relies on the November 23, 2021 polygraph and the hair follicle test \nresults to support his denial of fentanyl use. His negative answers to the three \npolygraph questions carry little weight because of Applicant\u2019s obvious interest in the \noutcome of the examination, and ultimately, in the renewal of his security clearance. \nSimilarly, I do not place much weight in the hair follicle test results because of the lack \nof evidence verifying the chain of custody of the specimen between the time the sample \nwas collected and the production of the test results. \nThe September 2022 administrative board decision recommending that \nApplicant not be separated from the service, could have been made for a variety of \nreasons. However, there is no documentation of a record or findings and \nrecommendations to enlighten me on what those reasons were. Accordingly, I cannot \n9 \n\n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nassign much weight to the board decision. In sum, insufficient time has passed to \nmitigate Applicant\u2019s fentanyl use.  \nSOR 1.b \u2013 Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is mitigated because of the passage of at \nleast 13 years since his last use of the drug. \nCriminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31 are: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless \nof whether the individual was charged, prosecuted or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nSOR 2.a - On February 24, 2023, Applicant was arrested and charged with \ndomestic assault of his four-year-old child. The arrest was based on visible bruises on \nthe victim and the statements by Applicant\u2019s former wife indicating her fear for family \nmembers. Because he was unsure of what constituted domestic assault, the arresting \nofficer consulted the special crimes unit of the police department. As a result of his \nformer wife\u2019s statements of fear for the children\u2019s safety, a juvenile court judge entered \na PO against Applicant on March 11, 2022. The PO was scheduled to expire after the \nsecurity clearance hearing on March 11, 2023. Applicant\u2019s domestic assault on a family \nmember was a credible allegation resulting in a lower court conviction that was reversed \nlater in November 2022 by the higher court. AG 31 (b) applies. Due to the recent \nexpiration of the PO, insufficient time has passed to remove AG \u00b6 31(c) as a disqualifier. \nSOR 2.b - Applicant\u2019s drug involvement leading to positive test for fentanyl on \nNovember 2, 2021, is cross alleged under criminal conduct even though Applicant was \nnot formally charged with a crime. The positive fentanyl test in November 2021 \nestablishes a credible allegation of fentanyl use under AG \u00b6 31(b). \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement with marijuana about six times from May 2009 to \nhis arrest in July 2009 for possession of the drug is cross-alleged under criminal \nconduct. AG 31(b) applies. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists the pertinent mitigating conditions that may be applicable in this \ncase: \n10 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.  \nSOR 2.a - There is evidence that Applicant has been complying with the \nconditions of the PO. Applicant\u2019s good performance record is demonstrated by the \ncitations and awards that he has received while in the USN. He plans to resume his \neducation in the spring of 2023 by seeking an associate degree in social science. But \nthe most persuasive evidence of reform and rehabilitation begins with the complete \nacceptance of past adverse conduct to prevent a recurrence in the future. Mitigating \nevidence under AG \u00b6 32(d) is limited. \nSOR 2.b - Applicant\u2019s positive test for Fentanyl occurred less than two years \nago. He has submitted no evidence to indicate that the testing of the urine sample was \nexecuted incorrectly or incompetently. Conversely, AG \u00b6 32(a) applies to mitigate \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use because of at least 12 years of abstinence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guideline (financial \nconsiderations) in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has been in the USN almost 13 years. In that time, he earned several \nawards, medals and ribbons for his service to the United States. However, in November \n11 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n2021, Applicant tested positive for fentanyl. He presented no evidence that established \nthat the test was improperly or unreliably performed. Though he submitted evidence of \nnegative urine tests taken before and after the positive test, he provided no evidence of \na retest of the original urine specimen that was retained in frozen storage until February \n2023. Considering the entire record, including the disqualifying and mitigating evidence, \nand the anger management issues that surfaced during the security clearance hearing, \nApplicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under the drug involvement and \ncriminal conduct guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

(Items 4, 5) \nAt the time Applicant became a U.S. citizen, he held citizenships in Colombia and \nVenezuela. He relinquished his Venezuelan citizenship because he had no loyalty or \nobligation there and did not intend to return in the future. Applicant remains a dual citizen \nof the United States and Colombia because his Colombian citizenship allows him to travel \nthere to visit his family without having to pay for a visa. He disclosed to the investigator \nthat he only uses his Colombian passport to enter and exit Colombia. He also has \nconsidered living in Colombia when he retires because it has a lower cost of living. He \nlast obtained a Colombian passport in 2016 and it expires in 2026. A review of the \npassport shows he used it for travel to Colombia in 2016, 2017 and 2022.

He does not like being forced to do \nthings. He does not feel a conflict of interest between his loyalties to the United States \nand Colombia. He told the investigator that he feels more American than Colombian but \nhe is still Colombian. He does not receive any government benefits from Colombia. He \nwas asked by the government investigator where his loyalty would lie in a time of conflict \nbetween the United States and Colombia, and he responded that he did not know. He \nthen said he would fight for the United States because he lives here. (Item 5) \nApplicant married in 2000 and divorced in 2002. His former wife was in the United \nStates on a student visa but overstayed when it expired. She was in the U.S. illegally at \nsome point. He then sponsored her to become a legal permanent resident. He told the \ninvestigator that she eventually became a U.S. citizen. They share an adult child born in \nthe United States. (Items 4, 5) \nApplicant remarried in 2013. They have an eight-year-old child who was born in \nthe United States. His wife is a citizen of Colombia. He sponsored her to enter the U.S. \nin 2014. Applicant told the investigator that she lives in the United States and has filed \nthe necessary documents to become a U.S. citizen. (Items 4, 5) \nApplicant\u2019s father is a dual citizen of Colombia and Venezuela and resides in \nColombia. From 1997 to 1999, he was in prison in the United States for selling illegal \ndrugs. Upon his release he was deported to Colombia. Applicant told the investigator he \nwas not involved with any illegal activities with his father. Once his father returned to \nColombia, he was again involved in selling drugs there. Applicant stopped communicating \nwith him for a period while he was involved in selling drugs. His father can never return \nto the United States due to his felony conviction. His criminal activity did not involve \nimporting illegal drugs.

He told the government \ninvestigator that if the house was seized it would not cause financial hardship. He did not \nprovide any other information about his current assets or finances. (Item 4, 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation; \n(c) shared living quarters with a person or person, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required \nto raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes \na risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a \nforeign government or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. \nThe mere possession of a close personal relationship with a person who is a citizen\nand resident of a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline \nB. However, depending on the facts and circumstances, this factor alone is sufficient to \ncreate the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nThe United States Department of State warns U.S. citizens to reconsider travel to \nColombia because of threats of terrorism and crime and to exercise increased caution \ndue to civil unrest and other violent attacks by dissident groups. It advises there is a high \nthreat in certain areas directed at or affecting U.S. Government interests. There are \nsignificant human rights violations, widespread government corruption, and violence \nagainst minority groups. \nApplicant\u2019s father, father-in-law, mother-in-law, half-sisters, half-brothers, uncles, \naunts, and cousins are citizens and residents of Colombia. He provides his father monthly \nfinancial support. He visits his family in Colombia and maintains daily contact with many \nof them and regular contact with others.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(c) and 7(f) apply. \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nI have analyzed the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 8 and conclude the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests;\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is suck that they are unlikely to result in a conflict of interest and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \nApplicant\u2019s family, which includes his father, mother-in-law, father-in-law, half-\nsisters, half-brothers, uncles, aunts, and cousins are citizens and residents of Colombia. \nHe has daily contact with some of them and weekly contact with others. He visits them in \nColombia. He provides financial support to his father. Applicant\u2019s contact with his family \nis not casual and infrequent. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his family in Colombia. It is an \nunsafe place for people residing there, and especially for U.S. citizens. Terrorism and \nhuman rights abuses are significant. Terrorist groups conduct kidnappings, bombings, \nand other attacks on innocent people. His brother-in-law works for the national police and \nhis mother receives a pension from the Colombian government. I cannot find that it is \nunlikely that Applicant would be placed in a position of having to choose between his \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrelatives and his wife\u2019s relatives and the interests of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) does \nnot apply. \nApplicant has been a U.S. citizen since 2001. I have considered that his children \nare citizens of the United States. Applicant\u2019s wife is a permanent resident. Applicant did \nnot provide any information about his overall finances to better understand whether his \nfinancial interests in Colombia might have a significant impact on him. Although, he \nindicated he is more American than Colombian, I was unable to make a credibility \ndetermination regarding his family interests and loyalties in Colombia. Applicant\u2019s close \nrelationship with his family in Colombia, his visits, his daily contact with several family \nmembers, his wife\u2019s daily contacts, and his financial support and financial interest are \nconsiderable. It is too great of a burden to expect him to be loyal to the interests of the \nUnited States and resolve any conflicts in favor of the United States over those of his \nrelatives. Applicant failed to provide any information other than his basic responses in the \nSCA and to the investigator to mitigate the security concerns raised under this guideline. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) and 8(f) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor or to \nquestion him about his foreign contacts and foreign financial interests.

The case was assigned to me on September 28, \n2023. The Government\u2019s documents identified as Items 1 through 4 and Applicant\u2019s \nFORM Response are admitted in evidence without objection. \nSOR Amendment \nIn her FORM, Department Counsel amended the SOR and withdrew the foreign \ninfluence allegations under Guideline B in paragraph 3. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations in his Answer, with explanations. He is \n24 years old. As of his May 2022 security clearance application (SCA), he was not \nmarried, he did not have any children, and he had lived with his parents and two \nyounger siblings since December 2021. He graduated from high school in 2017. While \nin college, he interned for his employer, a DOD contractor, from May 2019 to July 2019, \nMay 2020 to August 2020, and May 2021 to August 2021. He earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in December 2021. He was subsequently briefly unemployed before working \npart-time in data entry for a recruiting agency from February 2022 to April 2022. He has \nworked as a cyber systems engineer associate for his current employer since May \n2022. He was first granted a security clearance in approximately May 2020, as part of \nhis internships. (Items 1-3) \nApplicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from approximately 2017 \nthrough May 2021. He continued to use marijuana through May 2021, after he was \ngranted a security clearance in May 2020. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He began using marijuana in \ncollege in 2017. He smoked it weekly with his college roommates and friends to relax. \nHe contributed money towards the purchase of it. He did not use marijuana during his \nsummer breaks from college when he lived at home, before he began his internship with \nhis employer and passed a pre-employment drug screening, or during the summers of \nhis internship. He stopped using marijuana because he realized he had grown out of \nsuch college behavior, and he did not want to use it anymore. He disclosed this \ninformation during his July 2022 background interview. (Answer; Items 1-2; FORM \nResponse) \nApplicant did not disclose his drug involvement in response to section 23 of both \nhis October 2019 SCA and his 2022 SCA, which inquired about illegal use of drugs or \ndrug activity. He marked \u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose his marijuana use in response to a \nquestion on both SCAs that inquired whether he had illegally used any drug or \ncontrolled substances in the last seven years. He also marked \u201cNo\u201d on his 2022 SCA, in \nresponse to a question that inquired whether he had ever illegally used or otherwise \nbeen illegally involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security \nclearance, and he did not disclose his use of marijuana while holding a security \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance. He disclosed on his 2022 SCA that he had a security clearance that was \ngranted to him in May 2020. (Answer; Item 3) \nApplicant indicated during his background interview that he did not disclose his \nmarijuana use on his 2019 SCA because he thought it would affect his ability to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. He also indicated that he intended to disclose his marijuana use on \nhis 2022 SCA by correcting his negative responses from his 2019 SCA, but he forgot to \ndo so. (Item 2) \nIn March 2023, Applicant signed a statement of intent stating, \u201cI have no intention \nof smoking marijuana, or consuming any other controlled substances, presently or in the \nfuture.\u201d He expressed his regret and remorse over his actions. He stated that he is more \nmature and regrets that his actions have jeopardized his work. He stated that he no \nlonger socializes with the friends from college with whom he used marijuana. He \nreiterated that he did not disclose his marijuana use on his 2019 SCA because he was \nafraid that it would affect his chances of obtaining his internship. He admitted that he did \nnot disclose his marijuana use on his 2022 SCA because he was afraid it would affect \nhis job. He stated: \nI can only work to rectify the mistakes of my past. That is why I informed \nthe [background] investigator that I wanted to \u201ccome clean\u201d and \nsubsequently disclosed my prior marijuana use. . . . my intent today is to \nget the record straight.  \n(Answer; Item 2; FORM Response) \nTwo individuals, a professional associate as well as a friend from college, \nattested to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. The professional \nassociate, who has known Applicant since June 2022, described Applicant as \nresponsible, trustworthy, with a good work ethic. (Answer) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . . ;\u201d \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\u201d and \n\u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from 2017 to 2021. Although he used marijuana after \nhe was granted a security clearance in 2020, there is no evidence that he used \nmarijuana while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply, but \u00b6 25(f) does not. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana from 2017 through 2021. He used marijuana after he \nwas granted a security clearance in 2020. Although he expressed his remorse, signed a \nstatement of intent to abstain from smoking marijuana and any other controlled \nsubstances, and stated that he no longer socializes with the friends from college with \nwhom he used marijuana, his last use is recent enough that I cannot find that it is \nunlikely to recur. I find that none of the above mitigating conditions are established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.

He also marked \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose his marijuana \nuse, to include such use while holding a security clearance, in response to relevant \nquestions on his 2022 SCA. He admitted that he did not disclose his marijuana use on \nhis 2019 SCA because he thought it would affect his ability to obtain a security \nclearance. He also admitted that he did not disclose his marijuana use on his 2022 SCA \nbecause he was afraid it would affect his job, after initially indicating that he simply \nforgot to correct his negative responses from his 2019 SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating condition: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant did not make prompt, good-faith efforts to correct his omission \nregarding his relevant drug use on his 2019 SCA. AG \u00b6 17(a) is not established for SOR \n\u00b6 2.a. Although he disclosed his marijuana use during his July 2022 background \ninterview, he lied when he indicated that he forgot to correct his negative responses \nfrom his 2019 SCA in response to the relevant drug-related questions on his 2022 SCA. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnly later did he admit that he did not disclose his marijuana use on his 2022 SCA \nbecause he was afraid it would affect his job. His omissions were not caused or \ncontributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with professional responsibilities \nfor security processes. His omissions are not minor, and they occurred as recently as \n2019 and 2022. While he expressed his regret and remorse over his actions and stated \nthat he wanted to rectify his past mistakes, his deliberate omissions in his SCAs raise \nquestions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. As such, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17(a), 17(b), 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline E in this whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the personal conduct and drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted all of the SOR allegations under Guideline H, and partially admitted one allegation under Guideline F and denied the other allegation. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, and 2.a-2.b) I adopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. (Item 2) Applicant is 34 years old. He is single, never married, and has no children. He has worked as a systems manager for his current employer, a federal contractor, since July 2019. That contractor is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq. Applicant is a high school graduate who has taken some college courses. He completed a security clearance application (SCA) for his current job in February 2022.

After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. (Item 2) \nApplicant is 34 years old. He is single, never married, and has no children. He \nhas worked as a systems manager for his current employer, a federal contractor, since \nJuly 2019. That contractor is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. \n701 et seq. Applicant is a high school graduate who has taken some college courses. \nHe completed a security clearance application (SCA) for his current job in February \n2022. (Tr. 6, 18-20; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline H, that Applicant: \n-used and purchased marijuana, at various times, from June 2006 to \nabout December 2022 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b); \n-tested positive for illegal drugs in 2009, preventing him from enlisting in \nthe U.S. Air Force (SOR \u00b6 1.c); \n-was cited by police for illegal possession of drug paraphernalia in about \n2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); \n-was cited by police for illegal possession of marijuana in June 2018 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e); and \n-resigned from his position as a police dispatcher in lieu of termination, \nbecause of his June 2018 citation for illegal possession of marijuana (SOR \n\u00b6 1.f). \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline F, that Applicant: \n-failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2016, \n2017, 2018, and 2021 (SOR \u00b6 2.a); and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n- failed to timely file his state income tax returns for tax year 2021 (SOR \u00b6 \n2.b). \nGuideline H. \n \n \n  \nMarijuana use and purchase and possession. \nApplicant admitted his marijuana use and purchases from 2006 to approximately \nFebruary 2022, in his February 2022 SCA, his March 2022 personal subject interview \n(PSI) with an investigator, his December 2022 answers to DOHA interrogatories, and in \nhis January 2023 SOR answer. He also admitted his positive drug test in 2009, which \nprevented his enlistment in the Air Force, and his citations for possession of marijuana \nin 2018 and possession of drug paraphernalia in 2010. During his PSI, he told an \ninvestigator that when he was using and purchasing marijuana, he knew it was illegal \nunder federal law and against his current employer\u2019s policy. He also testified that he \nknew marijuana use was illegal under federal law. (Tr. 27, GE 1-2; SOR Answer) \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana over the years for recreational \npurposes and as pain management for his back and joints. He used marijuana by \nsmoking it and consuming edibles. He testified that he still uses marijuana on a less \nthan regular basis. He resides in a state where marijuana is legal under state law. He \ntestified that his most recent use of marijuana was in August 2023. He estimated that he \nused marijuana \u201cless than a dozen times\u201d from January 2023 to August 2023. (I will not \nuse his admissions concerning his use of marijuana after April 2022, as alleged in the \nSOR, for disqualification purposes, but I may use this information in assessing \nmitigation and in my whole-person analysis) (Tr. 20, 25, 30) He was asked if he planned \non continuing to use marijuana in the future, and he responded as follows: \nIt's very possible. I mean, if I go with this, if I get approved for this, I will \ndefinitely not be smoking until it\u2019s legalized federally. (Tr. 27) \nGuideline F. \n \n  \nFederal and State Tax Return Filings. \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file his 2017-2018 \nfederal income tax returns. He claimed he was unaware of not filing his 2016 federal \nreturn in a timely manner, and he claimed he filed an extension for his 2021 federal \nreturn. He also claimed he filed an extension for his 2021 state income tax return. (SOR \nanswer) \nApplicant testified that he failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal tax \nreturns. In the past, his parents always reminded him to do his taxes, but he no longer \nlived with them and no one reminded him to do so for these years. He did not think \nabout his taxes again until he began the security clearance process. He claims that his \nfederal tax returns for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2021 have all been filed.

The record was kept open for two months, \nbut Applicant did not submit any additional information for this tax year. (Tr. 23, 31, 36; \nGE 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant used, purchased, and possessed marijuana and drug paraphernalia, as \nstated in the SOR. He also tested positive on a pre-enlistment drug test. I find that AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), and 25(c) apply, except as to SOR \u00b6 1.f, which does not state a \ndisqualifying condition under Guideline H. His resignation from employment due to his \ndrug use citation was a consequence of his drug possession and not a separate \ndisqualifying event. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. One \npotentially applies in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant began using marijuana in 2006 and his most recent use of it was in \nAugust 2023, eight months after receiving the SOR, and just one month before his \nhearing. He expressed an equivocal intent not to use marijuana in the future, but he did \nnot provide a signed statement of his intent not to use or misuse drugs in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s long-term and very recent marijuana use, after knowing it was against \nfederal law, casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nHis mitigation evidence is insufficient to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. AG \u00b6 \n26(a) does not apply. \nI also note in accordance with the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s clarifying \nguidance letter concerning marijuana dated December 21, 2021, I have considered that \nthe evidence here does not support mitigation because of Applicant\u2019s recent use of \nmarijuana and his ambivalence about his future intent to use. The guidance also states \nthat violation of federal drug law remains relevant, but not determinative, to \nadjudications of security clearance eligibility. (See ES 2021-01529) \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2016-2018 federal income tax returns, and his \n2021 state income tax return. I conclude that his 2021 federal return was filed within the \ntimeframe for an extension. I find the above disqualifying condition is raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially applies: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant claims he filed all his state and federal tax returns for 2016-2018, and \n2021. With the exception of his 2021 federal return, however, he failed to provide \nsufficient documentation corroborating that claim. Documentation shows that his filing of \nhis 2018 federal return was untimely. He testified that he only became concerned about \nhis tax filings once he began the security clearance application process. He did not \nprovide sufficient mitigation evidence to establish the full applicability of AG \u00b6 20(g. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 5, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse). Applicant responded to the SOR on January 20, \n2023, and requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on February 1, 2023. A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on February 16, 2023. As \nof April 6, 2023, he had not responded. The case was assigned to me on June 1, 2023. \nThe Government exhibits included in the FORM are admitted in evidence without \nobjection. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He worked as a \ncontractor for his current employer from September 2019 until he was hired by the \ncompany as an employee in June 2020. He is applying for a security clearance for the \nfirst time. He attended college for a period, but he did not earn a degree. He has never \nmarried, and he has no children. (Item 5) \nApplicant used a variety of illegal drugs from about 2008 through November \n2022. He was cited or charged in about March 2011 with possession of drug \nparaphernalia; in about April 2011 with possession of toxic chemicals (inhalants, etc.); \nand in May 2012 with possession of marijuana. He paid fines for the offenses. (Items 4, \n5) \nApplicant reported on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nSeptember 2021 that he used hallucinogenic mushrooms twice in his life (2011 and \n2017), both times in safe environments in nature on hiking or camping trips for \n\u201cmedical/spiritual purposes.\u201d He wrote that he intended to use the drug in the future, \nwith the comment, \u201c[m]ushrooms have mental health benefits when used \nmedicinally/spiritually in nature and I enjoy their benefits. I only plan to use this \nsubstance in safe settings and on rare occasions.\u201d (Item 5) \nApplicant lives in a state where recreational marijuana possession and use do \nnot violate state law. He reported his marijuana use on the same SF 86 in September \n2021. He wrote that he intended to use marijuana in the future, with the comment, \u201cI am \nnot under the belief that occasional marijuana use is terribly harmful to mental health or \nevil.\u201d (Item 5) \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in November 2021. \nHe openly discussed his illegal drug use. He stated that he smoked marijuana about \nonce every other week, and he purchased it about every two months, most recently in \nOctober 2021. He stated that he knew marijuana possession violated federal law, but he \ndisagreed with the law and intended to continue to use marijuana. He also disagreed \nthat possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms should be unlawful; there was research \nshowing the benefits of the drug; and he did not intend to give up the use of the drug. \n(Item 6) \nApplicant responded to interrogatories on December 21, 2022. He reported that \nhe continued to purchase and use marijuana, with November 25, 2022, as the most \nrecent time he purchased and used marijuana. He stated that he did not intend to use \nillegal drugs in the future if granted a security clearance. He added, \u201cI would rather quit \nusing any illegal substances than be denied a security clearance. I am far from addicted \nand will uphold the federal laws while maintaining a security clearance.\u201d (Item 6) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn January 20, 2023, Applicant wrote in his response to the SOR: \nWhile marijuana is legal in my state, I admit I have indulged responsibly \nseveral times throughout the years on holidays or long weekends. I \nbelieve that it should be made legal federally as it is not an extremely \nharmful substance. However, to achieve a security clearance, I have \ndecided to stop using marijuana and all federally illegal substances. I can \ncurrently pass a drug test and have been sober since the turn of the year. \nI understand that marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms remain federally \nillegal. And I intend to follow these, and all other laws set out by the \ngovernment. I am psychologically and physically sound and am willing to \ncomply with all laws, rules, and regulations. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used a variety of illegal drugs from about 2008 through November \n2022. He was cited or charged in about March 2011 with possession of drug \nparaphernalia; in about April 2011 with possession of toxic chemicals; and in about May \n2012 with possession of marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThe 2011 and 2012 charges against Applicant are mitigated by time. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nthrough 1.e are concluded for Applicant. \nApplicant used marijuana after he submitted his SF 86 in September 2021, after \nhe was interviewed for his background investigation in November 2021, and as recently \nas November 2022. The Appeal Board has \u201clong held that applicants who use \nmarijuana after having been placed on notice of the security significance of such \nconduct may be lacking in the judgment and reliability expected of those with access to \nclassified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2021). See \nalso ISCR Case No. 21-02534 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2023) (\u201c[A]fter applying for a \nsecurity clearance and being adequately placed on notice that such conduct was \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance, an applicant who continues to use \nmarijuana demonstrates a disregard for security clearance eligibility standards, and \nsuch behavior raises substantial questions about the applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d) \nApplicant only used hallucinogenic mushrooms twice, in 2011 and 2017. That \nconduct would be mitigated except that in November 2021, he stated that he intended to \nuse the drug in the future. Someone who picks and chooses what laws he will follow is \nnot a good candidate for a security clearance. Applicant does not currently hold a \nsecurity clearance. His recent contingent promise that he will not use illegal drugs if he \nis granted a security clearance does not generate confidence that he has not continued \nto use illegal drugs or that he will not use them in the future. None of the mitigating \nconditions are applicable, and Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use is not mitigated. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

The information in his Answer to the SOR as well as the extensive comments set forth in his Response to the FORM are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact.

A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was \nmailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on March \n30, 2023, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.

His \nresponse was due on May 26, 2023. Applicant timely responded to the FORM, and it \nwas admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on August 1, 2023. \nRulings on Procedure \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take Administrative Notice of certain \nenumerated facts pertaining to the Arab Republic of Egypt (Egypt), appearing in \nextracts of ten written submissions issued by various U.S. Government sources. Facts \nare proper for Administrative Notice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized \nsource and relevant and material to the case. In this instance, the Government relied on \nsource information regarding Egypt in publications of the Department of State, the \nDepartment of Justice, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence, and the U.S. Mission to International Organizations in Geneva. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, \n2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-\n24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 10, 2004)); and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 \nn.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen \ntypes of facts for administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize \nauthoritative information or sources from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, \n126 S.Ct. 2749 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous documents).   \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule \n201, Federal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth \nbelow under the Foreign Influence Section, found in the Egypt subsection. However, \nwhile I do not reject the facts set forth in the press releases issued by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, any inference that Applicant or his family participated in criminal \nactivity was not argued by the Government and is specifically rejected. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all the SOR \nallegations pertaining to foreign influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). The information in \nhis Answer to the SOR as well as the extensive comments set forth in his Response to \nthe FORM are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nBackground \nApplicant is a 65-year-old Egyptian-born naturalized U.S. citizen. He came to the \nUnited States on a tourist visa in 1999, applied for permanent residence in 2000, and \nbecame a U.S. citizen in June 2019. He remained a dual citizen and has retained his \nEgyptian passport. However, he would be willing to renounce his Egyptian citizenship and \nsurrender his Egyptian passport if necessary (Item 3 at 8, 25; Item 5 at 4, 6) He is an \nemployee of a defense contractor and has been serving as a security professional \nsince December 2020. He previously worked for other employers as a site security \nsupervisor (September 2017 \u2013 December 2020); shuttle bus driver (June 2017 \u2013 \nNovember 2018); customs protection officer (July 2015 \u2013 December 2016); chief \nsecurity officer for an American hotel in Egypt (June 2004 \u2013 January 2012); and \ndirector of security at a mall in Egypt (January 2012 \u2013 June 2013). He received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree from an Egyptian University. He served as a military policeman with \nthe Egyptian Armed Forces for about 25 years and was honorably retired in the rank of \ncolonel. He has never held a U.S. security clearance. He was married in 1984. He has \ntwo adult children. \nForeign Influence \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents, now deceased, were Egyptian-born citizen \nresidents. (Item 3 at 32-33) His wife, a retired art teacher at a primary school, and two \nchildren are Egyptian-born citizens who first came to the United States on tourist visas \nwith Applicant in 1999; applied for permanent residence in 2000; and received \nrenewed tourist visas by periodically traveling back and forth to Egypt. His wife and \nyounger child (E) were granted permanent U.S. residence status when they were \nissued Permanent Resident Cards (Green Card) in 2013, but, because of a quirk in the \nlaw, his eldest child was no longer eligible to be included in the family unit because the \n13-year delay from application to approval had aged her out of eligibility. She has \nsince married and is residing in Egypt. They generally have monthly contact by phone \nor messenger. (Item 4 at 34) The children were initially enrolled in school in the United \nStates, and at the end of the school year in May 2001, Applicant\u2019s wife and their \nchildren traveled back to Egypt for summer vacation. (Response to FORM at 1-3) \nAt about the same time they departed for their summer vacation, Applicant was \ninvolved in an automobile accident. He underwent three months of physical therapy \nuntil August 2001, and he was scheduled for two different surgeries on September 1, \n2001 (hand), and September 15, 2001 (knee) \u2013 delayed until October 6, 2001.

After the first surgery was \ncompleted, he sought to obtain an extension for his visa based on medical conditions, \nbut because of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 (9-11), the offices were \nclosed and then the request was denied. Applicant\u2019s wife was unable to return to the \nUnited States to assist him due to the security situation following the attacks, and \nbecause of his first surgery, he was unable to grip a cane to walk. In late October or \nearly November 2001, Applicant was arrested by agents from the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service (INS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for \noverstaying his visa. He was told that the fact that his family had departed the United \nStates, his religion, and his former military rank were sensitive circumstances because \nof the 9-11 attacks. He spent 80 days in jail and an immigration judge refused to grant \nhim any positive resolution to extend his visa, continue his physical therapy, or be \nreleased on bail. He was released when he agreed to return to Egypt and purchased \nhis ticket but was not allowed to gather his belongings from his home. He was labeled \nas non-criminal and was not required to have an escort when he returned to Egypt. \nAnd then the world was impacted by COVID-19. Nevertheless, he eventually received \nhis Green Card and was welcomed back to the United States after the multi-year \ndelay. (Response to FORM at 1-3) \nApplicant noted that he considers himself to be a very good citizen with no \ncriminal record, an excellent credit score, and a taxpayer who respects all laws. He \nholds no grudges against anyone over his treatment following 9-11 and, as someone \nwho has worked in security in Egypt and the United States, actually supported such \nactions. He selected the United States to be his future country for himself and his \ngrandchildren, and he swore an oath of allegiance to the United States when he \nbecame a U.S. citizen. (Response to FORM at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s oath of U.S. citizenship in 2019 was as follows: \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure \nall allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \nsovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; \nthat I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States \nof America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true \nfaith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United \nStates when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in \nthe Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will \nperform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by \nthe law; and that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation \nor purpose of evasion; so help me God. \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/naturalization-test/naturalization-oath-allegiance-\nunited-states-america \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) in September 2021 by video-teleconference and \ntelephone, those interviews were conducted under \u201cCOVID-19 exigent circumstances \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nguidance\u201d according to the investigator. Upon viewing the summary of the OPM \ninterviews, Applicant disputed significant aspects of the summary, claiming they were \ninaccurate. At the time of the interviews, Applicant\u2019s wife and daughter were \ntemporarily residing in Egypt because of COVID-19, and they weren\u2019t permitted to \ntravel to the United States. Eventually, they both returned to the United States and \nresided in the same residence while his daughter gave birth. They were infected with \nCOVID-19. Applicant\u2019s wife and youngest child reside in the United States, awaiting \nnaturalization. (Response to FORM) \n \nApplicant also has a brother, a retired administration clerk; and two sisters, one \na retired teacher, and the other a retired civil engineer who worked for the city. All \nthree siblings are Egyptian-born citizen residents. They generally have weekly (with \nhis brother), monthly or quarterly (with his sisters) contact by phone or messenger. \n(Item 4 at 36-39; Item 5 at 10-11) Other than his own military past, no member of his \nfamily is or was affiliated with the Egyptian government, military, security, defense \nindustry, foreign movement, or intelligence service. (Item 4 at 31-39) \nAfter Applicant returned permanently to the United States in 2013, he continued \nto maintain periodic online or telephone contact with a friend who served with him in \nthe Egyptian military who is now retired. However, such communication is difficult \nbecause of the distance and time difference, and although Applicant described the \nrelationship as \u201csomewhat close,\u201d it is not extremely close. (Item 5 at 11-12) \nOther than his $600 monthly retirement pension for his military service, \nApplicant has no financial interests in Egypt. He characterized the pension as of \n\u201cminimal importance\u201d to his overall financial situation, and it would not cause him to \nhave divided loyalties with the United States and Egypt or make him vulnerable to \ninfluence or exploitation if threatened. (Item 5 at 6-7) \nEgypt \nEgypt is a republic governed by an elected president and bicameral legislature. \nTwo Egyptian presidents were removed from office in 2011 and 2013. In 2014, a new \nconstitution was approved by referendum, and in May 2014, former Defense Minister \nAbdel Fatah al-Sisi was elected president. A new legislature was elected in 2015 and \nthe president was reelected to a second four-year term in 2018. An April 2019 national \nreferendum established a set of constitutional amendments extending al-Sisi\u2019s term in \noffice through 2024 and possibly through 2030 if re-elected for a third term. Egypt was \nunder a government declared State of Emergency for all of 2019 and has been since \nthe April 2017 terrorist attacks on Coptic Churches. \nEgypt and the United States belong to several the same international \norganizations, including the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, \nand World Trade Organization. Egypt is a Partner for Cooperation with the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, an observer to the Organization of American \nStates, a partner in the NATO Mediterranean Dialogue, and a non-party state to the \nInternational Criminal Court.

The United States and \nEgypt share a strong partnership based on mutual interest in Middle East peace and \nstability, economic opportunity, and regional security. Promoting a stable, prosperous \nEgypt, where the government protects the basic rights of its citizens and fulfills the \naspirations of the Egyptian people, will continue to be a core objective of U.S. policy. \nU.S. assistance to Egypt has long played a central role in Egypt's economic and \nmilitary development and in furthering the strategic partnership and regional stability. \nSince 1978, the United States has provided Egypt with what now totals over $50 billion in \nmilitary and $30 billion in economic assistance. \nEgypt and the United States signed a Bilateral Investment Treaty in 1982 to \npromote and facilitate investment between the two countries. Egypt and the United States \nhave signed a trade and investment framework agreement, a step toward creating freer \ntrade and increasing investment flows. American firms are active in most sectors of the \nEgyptian economy, including oil and gas exploration and production, financial services, \nmanufacturing, construction, telecommunications technology, information technology, \nand the restaurant and hospitality industry. Flows of U.S. direct investment to Egypt were \n$1.37 billion in 2019, bringing the accumulated long-term stock of U.S. foreign direct \ninvestment to nearly $24 billion. \nThe U.S. has been largely involved in the Multinational Force & Observers (MFO) \noperation since 1982. The MFO is a peacekeeping operation that supervises and \nmonitors the implementation of the security provisions of the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli Treaty \nof Peace. \nExamples of recent cooperation between the United States and Egypt are as \nfollows: on March 14, 2021, an Egyptian ship and a U.S. ship performed a passing \nexercise; on February 23, 2021, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken's call with \nEgyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry occurred; on December 17, 2020, USTDA \nsupported major refinery upgrades in Egypt; on August 24, 2020, the Texas National \nGuard and Egyptian military began a long-term military partnership; on August 17, 2020, \nSecretary of State Michael R. Pompeo certified that Egypt is sustaining the strategic \nrelationship with the United States and meeting its obligations under the 1979 Egypt-\nIsrael Peace Treaty; and on January 8, 2019, an agreement was signed in Cairo \nregarding defense cooperation between the United States and Egypt and entered into \nforce. \nThe U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Egypt is Level 3: \nExercise increased caution due to terrorism and the Embassy's limited ability \nto assist dual national U.S. Egyptian citizens who are arrested or detained. \nDo not travel to the Sinai Peninsula (with the exception of travel to Sharm El-\nSheikh by air) or the Western Desert due to terrorism, and to the Egyptian \nborder areas due to military zones.

Terrorists may attack with little or no \nwarning, and terrorists have targeted diplomatic facilities, tourist locations, transportation \nhubs, markets, shopping malls, western businesses, restaurants, resorts, and local \ngovernment facilities. Terrorists have conducted attacks in urban areas, including in \nCairo, despite the heavy security presence. Terrorists have targeted religious sites, to \ninclude mosques, churches, monasteries, and buses traveling to these locations. \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Cairo as being a critical-threat \nlocation for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. Several \nterrorist organizations operate in Egypt. The Islamic State-Sinai Province terrorist group \n(also known as Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis (ABM), an ISIS affiliate) is the most active terrorist \ngroup in Egypt; it pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2014. In January 2021, the Department \nof State increased sanctions against HASM by designating the group as a Foreign \nTerrorist Organization under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nMost terrorist attacks in Egypt occur in the Sinai Peninsula and largely target \nsecurity forces, but terrorist attacks targeting civilians, tourists, and security personnel in \nmainland Egypt remain a concern. Though early 2020 witnessed a series of improvised \nexplosive device (IED) incidents in greater Cairo, those incidents became more infrequent \nas the year progressed. ISIS-Sinai Province (ISIS-SP) carried out the majority of the \nattacks, though it claimed no attacks in mainland Egypt and no attacks against Western \ninterests. ISIS-SP responded to ISIS's call to increase attacks to avenge the terrorist \ngroup's territorial defeat in Syria in March. There were at least 234 terrorist attacks \nacross the country in 2020. Harakat Sawa'd Misr (HASM) and al-Qa'ida allied groups \nsuch as Ansar al-Islam are believed to be behind the spate of anti-western attacks in \nmainland Egypt. Several terrorism-related incidents were reported on Egyptian news \nand on Egyptian social media in 2020, and included small arms attacks, IEDs, vehicle \nborne IEDs, kidnappings, executions, complex assaults, ambushes, and targeted \nassassinations. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of State, human rights issues in Egypt include \narbitrary or unlawful killings, including incidents that occurred while making arrests or \nholding persons in custody or during disputes with civilians.

The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the \nrecord.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  \nCir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFurthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have \nbased this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to \nApplicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has \nor has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n7: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s wife, two children, three siblings, and a friend from his military days \nare all Egyptian citizens. One of his children, his three siblings, and his friend are also \nresidents of Egypt. His wife and one child reside in the United States as permanent \nresidents awaiting the naturalization process to proceed to enable them to become U.S. \ncitizens. His contacts with some of them are manifestations of his care and concern for \nrelatives and close friends residing in Egypt. \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility. Direct or \nobjective evidence of nexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 13, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an Applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nDecember 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran). \nApplicant\u2019s continuing relationship with his siblings, a child, and a friend, as well as his \ncontinuing relationship with his wife and youngest child, and his military pension, are the \ncurrent concerns for the Government. However, the security significance of these \nidentified concerns requires further examination of those relationships and financial \ninterests to determine the degree of \u201cheightened risk\u201d or potential conflict of interest.  \nIn assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an Applicant\u2019s \nrelatives and friends in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors, \nincluding the totality of an Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, including the realistic \npotential for exploitation. One such factor is the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. In that regard, it is important to consider the character of the \nforeign power in question, including the government and entities controlled by the \ngovernment, within the relevant foreign country. Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is \nlimited to countries that are hostile to the United States. In fact, we must avoid reliance \non overly simplistic distinctions between \u2018friendly\u2019 nations and \u2018hostile\u2019 nations when \nadjudicating cases under Guideline B. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe nature of the foreign government involved, and the intelligence-gathering \nhistory of that government are among the important considerations that provide context \nfor the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate \nconclusions in the case. The country\u2019s human rights record is another important \nconsideration. Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law, \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Egypt with the United States, the situation in Egypt, including crime and \nterrorism, place a burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nrelationships with any family member or friend living in Egypt does not pose a security \nrisk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist relatives or a friend living in \nEgypt. \nThere are terrorist groups active in Egypt; increased levels of terrorism, violence, \nand insurgency; and human rights problems in Egypt that demonstrate that a \nheightened risk of exploitation, coercion or duress are present due to Applicant\u2019s ties to \nhis family and a friend. However, that risk is not generated by the Egyptian government, \nbut by terrorists striking out against the central Egyptian authorities and all foreigners. \nApplicant\u2019s family members and his friend residing in Egypt are potential targets in this \nwar on civilized humanity. The presence of terrorist groups and increased levels of \nterrorism, violence, and insurgency in Egypt have also been described concerning \nevents occurring on 9-11, and more recently in Fort Hood, Boston, Paris, Nice, Orlando, \nSan Bernardino, and New York City. However, as noted above, based on their \nrelationships, there is a potential, but greatly reduced, \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion to disqualify Applicant \nfrom holding a security clearance. \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Egypt seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his family members or his friend, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out \nsuch a possibility in the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Egypt has \na significant problem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family members and his \nfriend in Egypt could be a means through which Applicant comes to the attention of \nthose who seek U.S. information or technology and who would potentially attempt to \nexert coercion upon him. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and \nundivided, even after the challenging treatment he received from U.S. authorities \nfollowing the post 9-11 hysteria and that, after remaining in Egypt for so many years \nlegally awaiting his eventual return to the country that he and his family loved and \nwished to have as their home, he has such deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the U.S., that he can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest \nin favor of the U.S. interest. In this instance, because of his background, the degree of \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d or potential conflict of interest is dramatically reduced to nearly zero. \nNevertheless, because of the evidence related to his family and a friend in Egypt, AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) have been established. Further inquiry is appropriate to determine \npotential application of any mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists some conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security \nconcerns including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country a\n re such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and  \n(e) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \nAs indicated above, Applicant\u2019s eldest daughter, three siblings, and a friend are \nall citizen-residents of Egypt. He and his eldest daughter generally have monthly \ncontact by phone or messenger. The relationship with his siblings is apparently different \nbased on the frequency of contact that they all maintain. His primary method of \ncommunication with them remains telephone or messenger. His wife, youngest \ndaughter, and grandchild reside in the United States, and they maintain frequent \ncontact. His contacts with the entire family and his friend reflect his varying degree of \ncare and concern for those relatives and his friend residing in Egypt. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has concluded that contact every two months or more \nfrequently constitutes \u201cfrequent contact\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8.

Sep. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five \nmonths not casual and infrequent.) Frequency of contact is not the sole determinant of \nforeign interest security concerns based on connections to family. \u201c[I]nfrequency of \ncontact is not necessarily enough to rebut the presumption an applicant has ties of \naffection for, or obligation to, his or her own immediate family as well as his or her \nspouse\u2019s immediate family.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-01979 at 4 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019). \nApplicant cares for his family. \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He has significant connections to the United \nStates. He has been a resident of the United States for over a decade, and a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen for four years. He and his family followed the U.S. immigration \nrules and waited in Egypt before coming to the United States legally, not by ignoring the \nlaws and joining the masses of undocumented individuals who came across the border \nwithout proper authority. His wife and youngest child once again reside in the United \nStates as permanent residents awaiting naturalization as U.S. citizens. And he has a \nnative-born American grandchild. He intends to continue to work in the United States \nand continue raising his family here. \nOther than his $600 monthly retirement pension for his military service, Applicant \nhas no financial interests in Egypt. That amount is insignificant and of \u201cminimal \nimportance\u201d to his overall financial situation, and it is extremely doubtful that it could \nmake him vulnerable to influence or exploitation if threatened. Applicant\u2019s one \ndisappointment is that the immigration process took so long, that his eldest daughter\u2019s \neligibility to remain with the family unit was eventually denied. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s eldest daughter, three siblings, or his friend \nare or have ever been political activists, challenging the policies of the Egyptian \ngovernment; that terrorists have approached or threatened them for any reason; that \nthe Egyptian government or any terrorist organization have approached them; or that \nthey currently engage in activities that would bring attention to themselves. As such, \nthere is a reduced possibility that they would be targets for coercion or exploitation by \nthe Egyptian government or the terrorists, which may seek to quiet those who speak out \nagainst them. Also, there is no evidence that while Applicant was still residing in Egypt \nawaiting the issuance of his Green Card that he had been approached or threatened for \nany reason. Under these circumstances, the potential heightened risk created by their \nresidence in Egypt is greatly diminished. Under the developed evidence, it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the United \nStates. \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 relationship with and historical \ninvestments in Egypt.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966)) \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s foreign influence. A variety \nof terrorist groups operate in Egypt. For many years, terrorists, insurgents, and criminal \nactors have carried out major attacks against civilians in urban areas, including in Cairo, \ndespite the heavy security presence. They have targeted diplomatic facilities, tourist \nlocations, transportation hubs, mosques, churches, monasteries, markets, shopping \nmalls, western businesses, restaurants, resorts, and local government facilities. Egypt's \nborders are under military control; movement of non-military persons and vehicles is \nsubstantially restricted, and in some cases prohibited within these areas. The U.S. \nDepartment of State travel advisory for Egypt is Level 3: Exercise increased caution due \nto terrorism. According to the U.S. Department of State, human rights issues in Egypt \ninclude arbitrary or unlawful killings, including incidents that occurred while making \narrests or holding persons in custody or during disputes with civilians. There were also \nreports of civilians killed during military operations in Sinai. Impunity was a problem. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere were instances of persons tortured to death and other allegations of killings in \nprisons and detention centers. The government charged, prosecuted, and convicted \nperpetrators in some cases. \nApplicant\u2019s eldest daughter, three siblings, and his friend are Egyptian citizen-\nresidents, and he continues to maintain varying degrees of contact with each of them. \nApplicant also receives a monthly pension of $600 following his retirement from the \nEgyptian Armed Forces. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is a 65-year-old Egyptian-born naturalized U.S. citizen. He came to \nthe United States on a tourist visa in 1999, applied for permanent residence in 2000, and \nbecame a U.S. citizen in June 2019. He remained a dual citizen and has retained his \nEgyptian passport. However, he would be willing to renounce his Egyptian citizenship and \nsurrender his Egyptian passport if necessary. He is an employee of a defense contractor \nand has been serving as a security professional since December 2020. He previously \nworked for other employers as a site security supervisor; shuttle bus driver; customs \nprotection officer; chief security officer for an American hotel in Egypt; and director of \nsecurity at a mall in Egypt. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree from an Egyptian \nUniversity. He served as a military policeman with the Egyptian Armed Forces for \nabout 25 years and was honorably retired in the rank of colonel. \nApplicant\u2019s wife and youngest child are permanent U.S. residents awaiting U.S. \nnaturalization. He now has a native-born American grandchild. After the challenging \ntreatment he received from U.S. authorities following the post 9-11 hysteria, he \nremained in Egypt for many years legally awaiting his eventual return to the country \nthat he and his family loved, not by ignoring the laws and joining the masses of \nundocumented individuals who came across the border without proper authority. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without any questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns arising from his \nforeign influence issues. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  \nFor Applicant \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.   \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n16 \n",
