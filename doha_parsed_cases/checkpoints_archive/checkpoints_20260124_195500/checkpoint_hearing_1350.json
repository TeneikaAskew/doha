Schachter, Esq. \n01/09/2020 \nDecision \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana on several occasions from about \nOctober 2008 to July 2018. Guideline H (drug involvement and substance misuse) \ntrustworthiness concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied.      \nHistory of the Case \n \n \nOn July 28, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On June 7, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR \nto Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective on June 8, 2017.  (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue access to \nsensitive information for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether eligibility for a public trust position should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. Specifically, the SOR set forth trustworthiness concerns arising under \nGuideline H. (HE 2) \n\n \n2                                         \n \nOn August 9, 2019, Applicant provided a response to the SOR. (HE 3) On \nSeptember 9, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On September 16, 2019, \nthe case was assigned to me. On October 7, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals issued a notice setting Applicant\u2019s hearing for October 21, 2019. (HE 1D) On \nOctober 15, 2019, the hearing was cancelled. (HE 1C) On November 4, 2019, the hearing \nwas rescheduled for December 4, 2019. (HE 1A; HE 1B) The hearing was held as \nrescheduled.  \n \nThe Government offered 2 exhibits; Applicant offered 19 exhibits; and all proffered \nexhibits were admitted without objection, except Department Counsel objected to \nadmission of Applicant Exhibit (AE) G. (Tr. 12-18; GE 1-GE 2; AE A-AE G) Department \nCounsel\u2019s objection to AE G, the status of marijuana laws in the states and the District of \nColumbia, was overruled. (Tr. 15-18; AE G) The legalization of possession of small \namounts of marijuana in a state where Applicant resided reduces his culpability because \nhe would not be committing a state-criminal offense if he possessed a small amount of \nmarijuana in that jurisdiction. Possession of marijuana continues to violate federal law \nand trustworthiness standards under Guideline H for persons holding a public trust \nposition. (Tr. 17-18) A person may also violate an employer\u2019s standards by possession \nand using marijuana. On December 11, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the two SOR allegations. (HE 3) He also \nprovided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings \nof fact. Additional findings of fact follow.  \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old software engineer, and a defense contractor has \nemployed him since 2017. (Tr. 22-23; AE C) In 2008, he graduated from high school, and \nin 2011, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in applied mathematics and statistics. (Tr. 24-\n25, 29; AE E) He has never married, and he does not have children. (Tr. 22; GE 1)  \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \n \nIn 2008, Applicant began using marijuana when he was a freshman in college and \nliving in the college dormitories. (Tr. 25, 45) In college, he used marijuana with varying \ndegrees of frequency about every three months. (Tr. 27, 48) He received marijuana from \nfriends, and he did not purchase the marijuana that he used. (Tr. 27-28) He knew it was \nagainst the college\u2019s rules to use marijuana. (Tr. 28-29) \n \nFrom 2012 to 2017, Applicant used marijuana two or three times a year. (Tr. 29) \nHe used marijuana in his residence with his girlfriend in 2017, and his marijuana use \noccurred in a state where marijuana possession is illegal. (Tr. 43-44, 47) She procured \nthe marijuana and brought it into his residence. (Tr. 43) Their live-in relationship ended in \nNovember 2018. (Tr. 43) He probably had marijuana in his residence as recently as \nNovember 2018. (Tr. 57) Applicant\u2019s most recent use of marijuana was in July 2018. (Tr. \n\n \n3                                         \n \n29) Applicant used marijuana once in 2018. (Tr. 31) In July 2018, Applicant\u2019s sister \nprovided edible marijuana to him in a state where possession of small amounts of \nmarijuana does not violate state law. (Tr. 30, 48-49; AE G) Applicant did not consider \nwhether he was in violation of any laws or whether marijuana possession and use would \nhave an adverse effect on his employment when he used marijuana. (Tr. 31-33) He knew \nit violated federal law for him to use marijuana. (Tr. 32, 51) He did not think he would be \ncaught and punished if he used marijuana. (Tr. 32) \n \nWhen he completed his SF 86, Applicant admitted marijuana use, and he was \naware that using marijuana was significant to the process of approval for a public trust \nposition. (Tr. 33, 50; GE 1) He indicated on his SF 86 that he intended to continue to use \nmarijuana. (Tr. 35; GE 1) He used marijuana after completing his SF 86 because he was \nin a state where possession of small amounts of marijuana is legal, and he was in the \npresence of his siblings, \u201cand they were all using.\u201d (Tr. 33)    \n \nRecently, Applicant informed his siblings that they were not supposed to use \nmarijuana in his presence in the future, and if they chose to do so, he would leave and it \nwould adversely affect his relationship with them. (Tr. 38-39; AE D) Some of his friends \nused marijuana in his presence in 2017 and 2018, and Applicant did not want to sever his \nrelationships with them. (Tr. 40, 52) Less than two months before his hearing, Applicant \nwas at a party where marijuana was being used, and he did not leave the party. (Tr. 53) \nHe subsequently asked some of his friends not to use marijuana in his presence, and he \npromised to leave their presence if they started using marijuana. (Tr. 24, 40-41, 54, 58) If \nsomeone started to use marijuana in his presence, Applicant would leave. (Tr. 25) \nApplicant said his employer\u2019s policy was to preclude use of marijuana at work, but he was \nunaware of any policy precluding marijuana use during off-duty time. (Tr. 54-55) His \nemployer conducts drug testing. (Tr. 55-56) Applicant has never tested positive for the \npresence of an illegal drug in his body. (Tr. 56) \n \nAfter his April 20, 2019 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject \ninterview (PSI) Applicant decided that he would not use marijuana in the future because \nhe realized it would have a serious negative effect on his employment and access to \nsensitive or classified information. (Tr. 36-37, 41, 63) On October 31, 2019, Applicant \nreceived a substance abuse evaluation from a person who is a licensed clinical social \nworker (LCSW), certified substance abuse counselor (CSAC), master addiction counselor \n(MAC), and substance abuse professional (SAP). (AE B) Appellant advised the evaluator \nthat he \u201csometimes\u201d used marijuana with his girlfriend, and his use was limited to \u201c\u2018a \ncouple of hits\u2019 every six to nine months.\u201d (AE B1 at 2) He indicated his most recent \nmarijuana use was in July 2018. (AE B1 at 2) The evaluator concluded Applicant has \u201ca \nlow probability of an alcohol/substance use disorder\u201d and he \u201cis not at risk of relapse or \nreturn to his previous behavior.\u201d (AE B1 at 4) She did not diagnose Applicant with a \nsubstance use disorder, and she concluded no treatment was warranted. (AE B1 at 4) \nShe believes Applicant \u201cis fully capable of safeguarding classified information,\u201d and she \nsaid he is \u201cfit for duty in a position affecting national security.\u201d (AE B1 at 4)   \n \nApplicant has increased his physical exercises for better health and wellbeing. (AE \nF) Applicant does not believe that marijuana use is important to him, and he does not \nintend to use it in the future. (Tr. 37; AE A) Applicant agreed \u201cto random drug testing and \n\n \n4                                         \n \nto immediate and unqualified revocation of [his] security clearance in the event of any \nfuture positive drug test.\u201d (AE A) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant received excellent performance reviews. (AE C) The general sense of \nApplicant\u2019s eight written character statements is that Applicant is honest, loyal, reliable, \ntrustworthy, and sober. (AE D) He has ended his marijuana use and has made it clear \nthat he will not remain in the vicinity when marijuana is being used by others. (AE D)      \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance [or a public trust position].\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government\u2019s authority to restrict access \nto classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified \ninformation. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access to \ninformation bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. See \nId. at 527.  \n \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made.   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.   \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \n\n \n5                                         \n \nbeing eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security and trustworthiness suitability. See ISCR Case No. \n95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance [or access to \nsensitive information].\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or \ntrustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, \n484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nThe protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national \nsecurity.\u201d Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the trustworthiness concern for drug involvement: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nDirector of National Intelligence (DNI) Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence \nto Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, indicates: \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \n\n \n6                                         \n \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides two conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and \n\u201c(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance . . . .\u201d Applicant possessed and used \nmarijuana1 on several occasions from 2008 to July 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are \nestablished.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 details conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n1 Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substances. See Drug Enforcement \nAdministration listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales \nv. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). \n\n \n7                                         \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s [eligibility for a public trust \nposition], there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \n[access to sensitive information]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, \n1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the \nGovernment presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in [trustworthiness] decisions \nis that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He ended his marijuana \npossession and use in July 2018, and he leaves locations if marijuana use occurs. He \nadvised several friends and his siblings that it will adversely affect his relationship with \nthem if they use marijuana in his presence. He received a favorable evaluation from a \nLCSW, CSAC, MAC, and SAP who did not diagnose Applicant with a substance use \ndisorder. She also concluded no treatment was warranted. She believes Applicant \u201cis fully \ncapable of safeguarding classified information,\u201d and she said he is \u201cfit for duty in a position \naffecting national security.\u201d (AE B1 at 4) Applicant understands that marijuana \ninvolvement is inconsistent with holding a public trust position. He provided a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility. He promised not to use marijuana in the future.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigating drug involvement and substance misuse \ntrustworthiness concerns is more substantial at this time. Applicant possessed and used \nmarijuana on multiple occasions from 2008 to July 2018. Each time he possessed \nmarijuana, he committed a federal crime. He used marijuana in 2018 after completing an \nSF 86. He did not establish that his current employer, a DOD contractor, had no objection \nto his off-duty marijuana use. His marijuana use in July 2018 is recent. Drug involvement \nand substance misuse trustworthiness concerns are not mitigated at this time. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n8                                         \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant access to a \npublic trust position and access to sensitive information \u201cmust be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the \nwhole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old software engineer, and a defense contractor has \nemployed him since 2017. In 2008, he graduated from high school, and in 2011, he \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in applied mathematics and statistics. Applicant received \nexcellent performance reviews. The general sense of Applicant\u2019s eight written character \nstatements is that Applicant is honest, loyal, reliable, trustworthy, and sober. He has \nended his marijuana use and has made it clear that he will not remain in the vicinity when \nmarijuana is being used by others. He received a favorable evaluation from a LCSW, \nCSAC, MAC, and SAP. He understands that marijuana involvement is inconsistent with \nholding a public trust position. He provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement \nor misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. He promised not to use \nmarijuana in the future.  \n \nAppellant is credited with volunteering the information about his misuse of illegal \ndrugs. His marijuana possession and use was not detected through a urinalysis test, a \npolice report, or through witness statements. An honest and candid self-report of drug \nabuse is an indication that a security-clearance holder will disclose any threats to national \nsecurity, even if the disclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her own career \nor professional reputation.        \n \nThe evidence against granting Applicant access to sensitive information is more \npersuasive at this time. Applicant possessed and used marijuana on several occasions \nfrom 2008 to July 2018. Each time he possessed marijuana, he committed a federal \ncrime. His marijuana possession and use \u201craise questions about [his] ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 24.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \npublic trust position, there is a strong presumption against the granting access to sensitive \ninformation. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse trustworthiness concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a public \ntrust position to Applicant is not warranted at this time. Applicant clearly has the potential \nto receive access to sensitive information in the future; however, more time without \nmisuse of illegal drugs is necessary to fully mitigate trustworthiness concerns.  \n \n\n \n9                                         \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, and the \nAGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Guideline H \ntrustworthiness concerns are not mitigated at this time.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Price, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/22/2020 \nDecision \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate financial security concerns \narising from his delinquent debts and personal conduct security concerns arising from his \nfailure to disclose any delinquencies on his security clearance application. Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 13, 2018. On \nApril 17, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication Facility (DOD CAF) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The DOD CAF \ntook the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017.  \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 21, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the administrative (written) record, in lieu of a hearing. On August 30, 2019, \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding documents identified as Items 1 through 7. Applicant received the FORM on \nSeptember 9, 2019. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material \nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The SOR \nand the answer (Items 1 and 2) are the pleadings in the case. Items 3-7 are admitted into \nevidence without objection. The case was assigned to me on October 24, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, with explanations. He did not formally \n\u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny\u201d SOR \u00b6 2.a, but I construe his explanation as a denial. His admissions \nand explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. In May 2015, after serving 20 years on active duty in the \nU.S. Air Force, he retired as a tech sergeant (E-6). He earned an associate\u2019s degree while \nin the Air Force. He was unemployed for about a year after he retired, until mid-2016. \nSince then, he has worked a variety of jobs, including as a delivery driver and a laborer. \nHe was unemployed for about 90 days during winter 2017-2018 when he was laid off due \nto lack of work. He has been employed as a driver for a defense contractor since February \n2018. (Item 3) He held a clearance for 20 years, while in the Air Force. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant was married from 1995 to 2000, when he and his first wife divorced. They \nhad two daughters, both now grown. Applicant remarried in April 2006. His second wife \npassed away only weeks later, in May 2006. Applicant remarried in 2009. He and his third \nwife have two sons, ages 10 and 7. Applicant also has a stepson, age 14, from his third \nwife\u2019s prior relationship. (Item 3) \n \n \nThe Guideline F allegations in the SOR concern four small delinquent debts, and \na large debt to the U.S. Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs (VA). Under Guideline E, the \nGovernment alleges that Applicant failed to disclose any of those debts as delinquent \nwhen he submitted his SCA, in May 2018.  \n \nGuideline F \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a concerns a $106,684 debt to the VA (listed on credit reports as a \n\u201cgovernment overpayment\u201d). The amount alleged is taken from a February 2019 credit \nreport. (Item 5) An earlier credit report, from July 2018, lists the amount at $82,181. (Item \n6) The most recent credit report, from August 2019, lists the amount due at $76,716, the \nsame amount Applicant acknowledges in his Answer to the SOR. (Items, 2, 7)  \n \n \nThe circumstances of the debt are best explained in the summary of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground interview. When his second wife died, Applicant began receiving $1,700 a \nmonth from the VA. His second wife, A, had children, presumably from a prior relationship. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant said in the interview that A\u2019s children received a payout from their mother\u2019s life \ninsurance policy and her children \u201cinstructed subject to keep the funds he was receiving.\u201d \n(Item 4 at 3) His second wife\u2019s children are mentioned in Applicant\u2019s interview, but no \ndetails are provided. It is not known how many children his second wife had, how old they \nwere at the time she died, or if they were of majority age, and old enough to knowingly \nwaive their interests in such funds.   \n \n \nApplicant remarried in 2009. As a result, he was no longer eligible to receive \nbenefits from the VA as a widower. However, the payouts continued, though Applicant \nasserted in his background interview and in his Answer that he notified the VA that he \nhad remarried. He said in his interview that he assumed the payments were for his second \nwife\u2019s children and not for spousal benefits. If so, this does not explain why Applicant took \nno steps to see that that the money from the VA was re-directed to his second wife\u2019s \nchildren. (The interview summary actually refers to \u201ctheir children\u201d but this is likely \nerroneous, as it does not appear that Applicant and his second wife had any children \ntogether). (Item 4 at 3)  \n \n \nApplicant said in his background interview that, in any event, he continued to \nreceive funds from the VA until he was notified when he retired from the Air Force that he \nowed about $106,000 for the overpayments. (\u201cThey notified me of this overpayment the \nmonth I retired.\u201d) (Item 2) Applicant also said that, since 2016, the federal government \nhas kept his tax refunds and $100 of his monthly retirement pay. Other than that, he says \nhe has received no documentation from the VA. (Item 2, Item 4 at 3)  \n \nThere is no indication that Applicant is on a repayment plan except as indicated. \nApplicant provided no documents with his Answer to corroborate his assertions. However, \nthe amount he owes the VA ($76,716) is confirmed by Item 7, an August 2019 credit \nreport provided by the Government.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($4,839) is a credit card account for military personnel. It is in collection. \nApplicant admits the debt (at $4,490) and the most recent information shows a balance \nof $4,132 (as of August 2019) (Items 2, 7). Applicant noted in his Answer that the account \nis being garnished from his retirement pay (which, if so, would explain the declining \nbalance). He did not provide any documentation and did not indicate that the account is \notherwise on a payment plan. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($532) is a charged-off credit card account. (Items 5, 7) Applicant fell \nbehind on the account during a period of limited income. He attempted to resolve it with \nthe creditor but was unable to do so because the account has been charged off. (Item 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($174) is a past-due utility bill. Applicant said he paid the bill, and the \nAugust 2019 credit report shows a zero balance. (Items 2, 7) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($324) is a past-due cable bill. Applicant admits the debt, but is \nuncertain that it is valid, since he has cable service with the same company currently. He \n\n \n4 \n \n \nintends to pay the bill. The account is listed on the July 2018 credit report as being in \ncollections, but is not listed at all on the two later credit reports. (Items 5, 6, 7) \n \n \n \n \nApplicant explained that his financial circumstances were impacted by several \nevents. His mother passed away in 2012, and he and his wife had to assume her financial \nobligations. He lost significant income when he retired from the Air Force in 2015. His \nwife took a job while he pursued civilian employment and they ensured that their family\u2019s \nbasic needs were met. One of their sons was diagnosed with a rare medical condition. \nThey spent a lot of time and money taking him to specialists. They are trying to remain \nafloat financially. (Item 2) Applicant provided no information, documented or otherwise, \nabout his current finances, such as his assets, monthly income (and retirement pay), and \nmonthly expenses which might be used to determine his ability to pay his debts.  \n \nGuideline E \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, in May 2018, he did not disclose that he had \nany delinquent debts. He was asked to disclose delinquencies involving \u201cRoutine \nAccounts\u201d including \u201cbills or debts turned over to a collection agency\u201d and was asked \nwhether he had \u201cany account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for \nfailing to pay as agreed,\u201d in the past seven years. (Item 3 at Section 26)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the delinquent \naccounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e when he answered \u201cNo\u201d to those questions. All five of the \naccounts alleged are listed as being in collections on Applicant\u2019s July 2018 credit report, \ntwo months after his SCA. (Item 6) \n \nSection 26 of Applicant\u2019s SCA also asked Applicant if \u201cYou are currently delinquent \non any Federal debt.\u201d He answered \u201cNo\u201d to that question as well, despite the VA debt in \ncollection, as alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a, but falsification of that question was not alleged in the \nSOR.  \n \nEarlier on his SCA, Applicant provided details about all of his children, all of his \nwives (including specific dates of marriage, divorce, and death), his employment, his \nmilitary service and his home addresses. (Item 3) \n \nDuring his background interview, Applicant confirmed his negative answers to the \nfinancial questions on his SCA. He was then confronted with his 2018 credit report. He \nasserted that he was not aware of the accounts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. He \nacknowledged the military credit account at SOR \u00b6 1.b but was not aware of details, since \nhis wife handled the finances. He agreed with the VA account (SOR \u00b6 1.a) in all details. \n(Item 4 at 3) \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant apologized for omitting reference to the debts \non his SCA and said he \u201cwould not intentionally lie about present debt or past debt.\u201d He \nasserted that he struggles with computers and had never filled out an SCA on a computer \n\n \n5 \n \n \nbefore, though he has had a clearance for 20 years. He promised to be more careful in \nthe future. (Item 2)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nThis is an unusual case, in that the financial security concern derives from two \ncircumstances: four small debts reported for collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.e), debts that total \nless than $5,000; and the much larger debt to the VA, a debt also in collection for what \nwas about $106,000, now about $76,600. (SOR \u00b6 1.a)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a resulted from a \u201cgovernment overpayment\u201d of financial benefits to \nApplicant by the VA after his second wife died. Thus, the origin of the debt comes from \nneither an \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d or a \u201chistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nHowever, the debt is nonetheless now in collection status, as established by Applicant\u2019s \ncredit reports. In that sense, then, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a, as they do \nto the other debts in the SOR, debts which are also charged off or in collection.  \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is resolved. SOR \u00b6 1.e is probably resolved, since Applicant indicated \nthat he has an account with the same cable company, and the account is not reflected on \nthe most recent credit reports. SOR \u00b6 1.c is not resolved, though Applicant attempted to \ndo so.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is being resolved through garnishment of Applicant\u2019s retirement pay. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is also being resolved in this manner, and through the IRS\u2019s retention of \nApplicant\u2019s federal income tax returns. \u201cOn its face, satisfaction of a debt through the \ninvoluntary establishment of a creditor\u2019s garnishment is not the same as, or similar to, a \ngood-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.\u201d ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. \nSept. 21, 2009). Thus, AG \u00b6 20(d) has only limited application, to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d. and \n1.e.  \n \n \nApplicant had difficulty finding steady employment after leaving the Air Force, and \nhe experienced a decline in income. He has a child with a rare medical condition, which \nhas taken time, energy, and money to address. These factors are beyond his control, and \nhave had an impact on his finances. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore has some application. However, \nas with AG \u00b6 20(d), Applicant has undertaken little good-faith or reasonable effort under \nthe circumstances to pursue active resolution of his debts, most particularly the \noverpayment of the VA benefits. He provided no documentation of his active efforts to \nresolve the matter through any means other than the government\u2019s garnishment of his \nretirement pay and retention of his federal tax refund. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) do not fully \napply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has only partial application. Applicant\u2019s debt to the VA occurred \nfollowing the death of his second wife. This led to overpayment of benefits from the VA. \nThat was an unusual circumstance that is not likely to recur. However, the debt is both \nlarge and ongoing. It is also a debt to the federal government, a fact not unimportant when \nweighing Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to a federal security clearance. According to \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports, the debt also remains in collection status. As such, it is not \nestablished that the debt no longer casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s current judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \n\n \n8 \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose any of the five delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -1.e) on his May 2018 SCA, in \nresponse to a question asking for disclosure of debts in collection or charged-off debts \nduring the last seven years. Applicant admitted that he failed to disclose the debts, and \napologized. He asserted that he was unfamiliar with computers and had never filled out \nan SCA on a computer before. I have construed his answer to SOR \u00b6 2.a as a denial to \nthe allegation of deliberate falsification.  \n \nThe Government established that the five accounts were all past due. Applicant \ndenied knowledge of three of them (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.e) and said he was not aware that \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, the military credit account (an account he recognized) was delinquent. \nDeliberate failure to disclose these debts on the SCA is not established.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose the VA debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a), however, is harder to \nexplain. Chiefly, he acknowledged in his Answer that \u201cthey notified me about this \noverpayment the month I retired.\u201d He also knew that the Government was keeping his \nfederal income tax refunds, as well as some of his retirement pay. Unlike the other debts \nin the SOR (which total about $5,000) the VA debt, even now, is over $75,000, and was \nonce over $100,000. That makes it even more likely that Applicant was aware of it.  \n \nApplicant also acknowledged that he held a clearance for 20 years. By definition, \nhe had prior experience filling out a security clearance application, even if he had never \nbefore filled one out on a computer. He therefore had reason to know that he should have \ndisclosed the VA debt \u2013 a government debt that reached as high as $106,000 -- as a \npossible financial security concern.  \n \nApplicant had a duty to disclose the VA debt on his SCA, as the debt was in \ncollection to the federal government. I find that he deliberately failed to do so. AG \u00b6 16(a) \ntherefore applies to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose SOR \u00b6 1.a on his 2018 SCA. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth the applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n   \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and  \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nFalsification of a security clearance application is a serious matter. It goes to the \nheart of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. Once disqualifying conditions are \nestablished, Applicant has the burden to establish mitigation. He has not done so.  \n \nApplicant also had a duty to disclose the VA debt in answer to the question on the \nSCA asking him if \u201cYou are currently delinquent on any Federal debt.\u201d He answered \u201cNo\u201d \nto that question as well. Falsification of that question was not alleged in the SOR, and I \nhave not considered it as disqualifying conduct. However, the fact that he did not disclose \nthe VA debt on his SCA at all, and in particular did not do so in answer to this question, \nsignificantly undercuts any evidence of mitigation that might otherwise have been shown.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation that his second wife\u2019s children told him to keep the money \nfrom the VA since they had received life insurance benefits following their mother\u2019s death \nis undocumented. It is also dubious, without the ability to ask Applicant clarifying \nquestions. He asserted that he informed the VA of his subsequent remarriage, thereby \ncasting doubt, at least in his mind, on why the overpayment from the VA happened in the \nfirst place. But he also kept the money despite apparently concluding that it was meant \n\n \n10 \n \n \nfor his second wife\u2019s children, and was not for spousal benefits, without clarifying \nanything, either with them, or with the VA. His failure to act was both irresponsible and \nself-serving.  \n \nRegardless, Applicant also learned of the overpayment from the VA when he \nretired from the Air Force, in 2015, and he appears to have taken few if any active steps \nto resolve the matter in the years since then. Applicant\u2019s failure to take such steps to \nresolve a large Federal debt has a direct bearing on his eligibility to hold a Federal security \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s large, unresolved debt to the Federal government will remain a \nsecurity concern until he shows a documented track record of good-faith efforts to resolve \nit. It is not enough to do nothing, and to wait passively for the IRS to keep his federal tax \nrefund every year.  \n \nThe fact that Applicant knew about the VA\u2019s overpayment when he left the Air \nForce in 2015 also means he knew he should have noted it on his SCA in 2018, either as \na debt \u201cin collection\u201d (as alleged) or, at the very least, as a \u201cFederal debt\u201d (not alleged).  \n \n \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 30, 2019, October 7, 2019, and December \n3, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on February 10, 2020.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February 14, 2020, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on March 6, 2020.  The Government offered seven exhibits, \n\n \n2 \n \nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. \nThe Applicant offered five exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E, \nwhich were admitted without objection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 16, 2020. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 47 years old.  He has a high school diploma.  He is employed by a \ndefense contractor as a Plant Maintenance Worker.  He is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance in connection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant incurred delinquent debt totaling in excess of \napproximately $21,000, which include medical bills, and several other collection \naccounts.  In his answer, he admits to allegations 1.a., 1.i., and 1.j., and denies the \nothers listed in the SOR.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated September 16, 2016; \nJanuary 24, 2019; and January 31, 2020, confirm this indebtedness.  (Government \nExhibits 5, 6, and 7.)   \n \nApplicant began working for his current employer in November 2016.  When he \napplied for the job, he also applied for a security clearance.  Applicant testified that he \nfirst learned about his delinquent debt in March 2018 when he received a copy of his \ncredit report from the debt resolution company.  (Tr. p. 44.)  Applicant testified that \nbecause he is not good with computers, he had his sister electronically input all of the \ninformation in response to the questions on the application for him.  She sat at the \ncomputer and he sat next to her while they went through the questions on the \napplication. \n \nApplicant explained that in 2009, he underwent a surgery and that his medical \ninsurance benefits covered the costs.  His employer at the time was charging him for \ninsurance and deducting the regular payments for coverage out of each paycheck.  \nApplicant contends that his insurance company was supposed to cover his medical bills.   \nWhen Applicant learned of these financial delinquencies on his credit report in March \n2018, he hired a credit repair service to assist him in resolving these debts.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A.)  Since retaining the services of the debt resolution company he has been \nable to successfully dispute the debt that was listed as delinquent on his credit report.  \nEach of the delinquent medical debts have been removed from his credit report and are \nno longer owing. \n \nApplicant provided a copy of his most credit report that combines information \nfrom all three credit reporting agencies dated February 28, 2020.  This report shows that \neach of these debts listed on the SOR, except one, no longer show owing.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits A and C.)  \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n1.a.  A delinquent telephone account was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $1,103.   Applicant settled the debt for $604 on March 2, 2020.  The debt is \nno longer outstanding.  He was unable to get a receipt from the creditor, but did provide \na copy of his bank records showing the payment.  The debt has also been removed \nfrom his credit report.  (Tr. p. 28 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.)     \n \n1.b.  A delinquent medical account was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $401.  This debt is still under dispute.  (Tr. pp. 47-48.)    \n \n1.c  A  delinquent medical account was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $2,647.  Applicant settled the debt for $409.35 on March 2, 2020.  He was \nunable to obtain a receipt from the creditor, but did provide a copy of his bank records \nshowing the payment.  The debt has been removed from his credit report.  (Tr. p. 48-49 \nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.) \n \nd.  A delinquent medical account was charged off in the approximate amount of \n$2,064.  This debt has been disputed and removed from his credit report.  (Tr. p. 49 and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A and C.)  \n \n1.e.  A delinquent medical account was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $12,880.  This debt has been disputed and removed from his credit report.  \n(Tr. p. 49 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and C.) \n \n1.f.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $630.  This debt has been disputed.  It has not yet been \nremoved from Applicant\u2019s credit report.  (Tr. p. 49 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and C.) \n \n1.g.  A delinquent cable service account was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $244.  This debt has been disputed and removed from his credit \nreport.  (Tr. p. 49-50 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and C.)   \n \n1.h.  A delinquent medical account was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $351.  This debt has been disputed and removed from his credit report.  (Tr. \np. 51 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and C.) \n \n1.i.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$513.  This debt has been disputed and removed from his credit report.  (Tr. p. 52 and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A and C.)  \n \n1.j.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$432.  This debt has been disputed and removed from his credit report.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits A and C.)  \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \nOn August 15, 2016, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP).  In response to Section 22 of the questionnaire, \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant was asked if in the last seven years has he been issued a summons, citation, \nor ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding against him; has he been arrested \nby any police officer, sheriff, marshal or any other type of law enforcement officer; has \nhe been charged, convicted, or sentenced of a crime in any court, or has he been or is \nhe currently on probation or parole?  Applicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d  This was a false \nanswer.  In September 2009, Applicant was arrested on a warrant for Failure to Appear \nfor Trafficking in Illegal Drugs.  In July 2011, he was arrested and charged with \nBattery/Domestic Violence.  In June 2013, he was cited (not arrested) and charged with \nPossession of Marijuana and Unlawful Possession of Drug Paraphernalia.   \n \n \nSection 22 of the questionnaire asked the Applicant if he has ever been charged \nwith any felony offense; and/or has he ever been charged with an offense involving \nalcohol or drugs?  Applicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d  This was a false answer.  Applicant failed \nto disclose his arrest in February 1994 for Trafficking in Illegal Drugs.  Applicant testified \nthat the charge was dropped from a felony to a possession charge.  Even so, this is still \na drug-related charge.   \n \nSection 23 of the questionnaire asked the Applicant if in the last seven years has \nhe illegally used any controlled substances?  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d  This was \na false answer.  Applicant failed to disclose that he used marijuana from approximately \n1990 through at least February 2016. \n \nApplicant testified that he would never answer any of the questions on the \nsecurity clearance application dishonestly, nor would he intentionally try to conceal his \ndrug involvement or criminal history or any information from the Government.  He adds \nthat when asked by the investigator about his past illegal drug use and criminal history \nhe admitted everything.  He admits, however, that he did not take the whole process as \nseriously as he should have.  Applicant explained that he is not good with computers \nand so he asked his sister to help him with the application.  At the time he completed \nthe application, he still worked two jobs, and so he would meet his sister in the middle of \nthe night when he got off work and they would work on the application together.  His \nsister sat at the computer and input the information.  He sat next to her and assumed \nshe was inputting the correct information.  He states that he did not have control of the \ncomputer.  He also assumed she was inputting the information truthfully.  (Tr. pp. 61-\n62.)  Applicant realizes now that he should have checked what his sister put down on \nhis application before signing it.     \n \nApplicant received a \u201cBravo Award\u201d from his company on February 27, 2020, \nacknowledging his excellent performance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \n \nA letter of recommendation from his supervisor dated February 10, 2020, \nindicates that Applicant is a dedicated, responsible, trustworthy employee.  He has an \noutstanding work ethic and his teamwork is greatly valued and recognized by the \ncompany.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)   \n \nA letter from the Pastor at his church dated March 3, 2020, who has known the \nApplicant for the past twenty years, states that Applicant has strong morals and values.  \n\n5 \nHe is a man of integrity, talent, and is developing Godly character.  He is intelligent, \ncaring and responsible.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)  \nApplicant has been actively involved in his community by working with the youth \nin his church by showing them leadership and guidance for the past fifteen years.  (Tr. \np. 44.)\nApplicant states that he has learned from his mistakes and he will never allow his \ncarelessness to happen again.  (Answer to SOR dated July 30, 2019.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n6 \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nApplicant underwent a surgery in 2009.  He states that his medical insurance \ncompany was responsible to pay the bills.  There is no evidence in the record to the \ncontrary.  Accordingly, his insurance should have paid his medical bills and they did not. \nThese delinquent debts were placed in collections and listed as delinquent on \nApplicant\u2019s credit report.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n  \nWhen Applicant became aware of the delinquent debts listed on his credit report \nthat were not rightfully his responsibility, he took action.  He acted responsibly, and \nhired a debt resolution company to help resolve them.  They were successfully \ndisputed, and/or paid.  All but one has been removed from his credit report.  Applicant \nhas been responsible and has shown good judgment and reliability with respect to his \nfinances.  Accordingly, the financial consideration security concern has been mitigated.  \nThis guideline is found for Applicant.     \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n\n8 \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a\nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the\nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting,\nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon\nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations.\nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Even though Applicant did not \ninput the information himself on his security clearance application, he has the duty and \nresponsibility to ensure that the information provided to the Government is accurate and \n\n9 \ntruthful to the best of his ability.  Applicant\u2019s sister electronically inputted the information \nand Applicant should have checked and reviewed what she inputted to ensure its \naccuracy.  Applicant was careless and did not take the process seriously.  He signed \nthe document and in doing so attested to its truthfulness.  Applicant answered, \u201cNO,\u201d to \nquestions on his security clearance questionnaire concerning his police record, and \nillegal drug abuse, which he should clearly have admitted.  There is no excuse for this \ndishonesty or carelessness and clearly calls his character into question.  In either case, \nconsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness.  To be entrusted with the privilege of holding a security \nclearance, one is expected to be honest and truthful at all times, and to know and \nunderstand the rules and regulations that apply to them, and to always abide by those \nrules.  Under the particular facts of this case, Applicant has not demonstrated this \nawareness.  By failing to answer these questions correctly on the security clearance \napplication, his conduct does not show honesty, integrity, good judgment or reliability. \nAt this time, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for access to classified \ninformation.  Accordingly, the personal conduct security concern has not been \nmitigated.  This guideline is found against Applicant.     \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1)\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Personal Conduct security concerns.  \n\n10 \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.j. \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

It was also alleged that Applicant has two sisters-in-law who live in Iraq and are Iraqi citizens (SOR 1.c), and that his extended family members and associates are citizens of and reside in Iraq, some of whom have or are serving in the Iraqi government and military (SOR 1.d). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations all of the SOR allegations. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact.

The security \nconcerns raised by Applicant\u2019s ties to family members residing in, and who are citizens \nof, Iraq are not mitigated. His request for a security clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n \nOn August 30, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nhis employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not determine that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nclearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and \nby DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n  \n \nOn July 15, 2019, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that \nraise security concerns articulated in the adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the \nDirector of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all \nadjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Specifically, this case is governed by Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence). \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. With \nhis response, he proffered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 H. I received the case on \nNovember 25, 2019, and convened the requested hearing on January 30, 2020. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 3. Appellant appeared as \nscheduled, testified, and proffered AX I - U. All exhibits were admitted without objection. \nAdditionally, five witnesses testified for Applicant. The record closed on February 3, 2020 \nwhen I received two post-hearing submissions from Applicant. Those documents have \nbeen admitted, without objection, as AX V (Certificate of Appreciation, one page) and W \n(2019 IRS Form 1098, one page). I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February \n10, 2020. \n \n \nDepartment Counsel also submitted three administrative exhibits included in the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit (HX) 1 (Index of Government Exhibits, one page), HX 2 \n(Department Counsel Discovery Letter, dated September 20, 2019, two pages), and HX \n3 (Department Counsel\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice re Iraq, dated January 23, \n2020 (seven pages). With HX 3, Department Counsel included 16 exhibits (Items I \u2013 XVI) \nin support of the request for administrative notice. After allowing Applicant\u2019s counsel to \nbe heard in response to the motion, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s request and have \nconsidered herein the information provided as appropriate. (Tr. 14 \u2013 15) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen and resident \nof Iraq (SOR 1.a), and that his mother-in-law and father-in law, a former senior official in \nthe Iraqi government, are Iraqi citizens residing in Iraq (SOR 1.b). It was also alleged that \nApplicant has two sisters-in-law who live in Iraq and are Iraqi citizens (SOR 1.c), and that \nhis extended family members and associates are citizens of and reside in Iraq, some of \nwhom have or are serving in the Iraqi government and military (SOR 1.d). \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations all of the SOR \nallegations. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old and employed as a linguist by a defense contractor for \nwork in support of U.S. military missions in the Middle East. He was born and educated \nin Iraq, receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree from an Iraqi university in 2006. In 2005, one of \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s professors warned him that a militia of Shi\u2019ite Muslims was targeting Applicant, \nwho is a Sunni Muslim, for assassination and that he should leave the country. Applicant \nfled to Jordan for a few months until the professor called him to say it was safe to return. \nApplicant left Iraq for good in July 2007, moving first to Egypt, where he lived until March \n2008. At that time, Applicant left Egypt for Jordan, where he lived until immigrating to the \nUnited States in June 2009. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August 2014. \n(Answer; GX 1 \u2013 GX 3) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP in August 2017, he declared that he was \nsingle; however, in December 2016, he had travelled to Iraq to meet the woman who is \nnow his wife. Theirs is an arranged marriage that was made official in Iraq in January \n2017. Nonetheless, Applicant identifies June 2018 as the start of his marriage. It was then \nthat he returned to Iraq to bring his wife to the United States, where the marriage was \nconsummated. They now have one child, who was born in the United States in May 2019. \nHis wife is still an Iraqi citizen and recently became a permanent resident alien. She will \nbegin her application for U.S. citizenship as soon as she is able. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; AX \nC; AX D; Tr. 26 \u2013 27, 35 \u2013 36, 58, 62 \u2013 64) \n \n \nApplicant initially planned to meet his wife in Jordan to accompany her back to the \nUnited States. He was hesitant to travel all the way to Iraq to meet his wife because he \nfeared for his safety. In the end, he travelled to Iraq on an Iraqi passport he had renewed \nwhen he was in Iraq to marry his wife in January 2017. For that trip, he also used an Iraqi \npassport. Applicant has since relinquished his Iraqi passport to his employer\u2019s facility \nsecurity officer (FSO) and expressed a willingness to formally renounce his Iraqi \ncitizenship. (Answer; GX 3; Tr. 46 \u2013 47) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, who were naturalized as U.S. citizens in 2015, and one of his \nbrothers, who became a U.S. citizen in December 2019, live with Applicant and his wife \nin a house Applicant bought in August 2012. Applicant also has two brothers living in the \nUnited States who are still Iraqi citizens and not yet permanent resident aliens here. \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents and siblings are Iraqi citizens and still reside in Iraq. His father-\nin-law retired in 2011 after a 26-year career as a senior official in the Iraqi government. \nApplicant has had little contact with his wife\u2019s relatives since he went to Iraq to marry his \nwife in 2017; however, his wife is very close with her family and communicates with them \nas often as daily. (Answer; AX G; AX H; AX Q; GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 28, 33, 36 \u2013 37, 48 \u2013 52) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is a retired Iraqi diplomat and press official, and his mother did \nnot work outside the home. Applicant\u2019s parents left Iraq for Jordan in 2000 because his \nfather was at risk of incarceration or worse at the hands of the Saddam Hussein regime. \nAfter living in both Jordan and Egypt, they immigrated to the United States in 2011. \n(Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3) \n \n \nApplicant also has extended family and other associates in Iraq, most of whom live \nin or near Baghdad. His family members are cousins, aunts and uncles on his mother\u2019s \nside. Many of them were or are employed by the Iraqi government or served in the Iraqi \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nmilitary after the Hussein regime was ousted in 2003 during Operation Iraqi Freedom. He \nhas had contact as often as monthly with some of those relatives. One of his associates \nis a retired pilot in the Iraqi air force who has served as a mentor to Applicant. Others are \nold friends or classmates. Applicant insists that he ended all contact with these family and \nfriends in Iraq in 2018 due to security concerns associated with his employment in support \nof the U.S. military. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 37 \u2013 38, 41) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance was sponsored by a defense \ncontractor who hired him in July 2017 for work as a linguist supporting a military mission \nin a country other than Iraq. Applicant now works for a different company doing similar \nwork, and he indicated he was returning overseas for that work soon after his hearing. \nHis deployment is due to end in October 2020. He also indicated that if he receives a \nclearance for his current position, he would likely be sent to Iraq, specifically to Baghdad. \nApplicant\u2019s wife, who communicates regularly with her parents and sisters, is aware that \nApplicant requires a security clearance for his work. (GX 1; AX M; AX R; AX T; Tr. 32 \u2013 \n35, 42 \u2013 45) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s work with the military has earned him praise for his dedication and \nprofessionalism. A senior noncommissioned officer with whom Applicant worked closely \nfor several months in 2019 believes Applicant \u201chas shown tremendous loyalty, \ntrustworthiness and reliability\u201d and recommends Applicant for a security clearance. \n(Answer; AX O; AX V) \n \n \nTo properly assess the security significance of these facts within the adjudicative \nguideline at issue, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts regarding Iraq as \npresented in HX 3 and its supporting documents. Of particular note is the continued \ninability of Iraq=s freely-elected government to quell violence and instability that persist in \nparts of Iraq. These conditions are fueled and perpetrated by terrorist groups affiliated \nwith Al-Qaeda and ISIS, as well as by Sunni insurgents and Iranian-backed Shiite militias. \nAs a result, some parts of Iraq remain wholly unstable. Even the city of Baghdad is still \nsubject to random acts of terrorist violence.  \n \nU.S. citizens and interests in Iraq remain at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist \nviolence. The U.S. State Department has advised against all individual travel to Iraq. The \nability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens outside Baghdad \nand the southern city of Basra is extremely limited given the security environment. ISIS \nagain controls significant portions of Iraq\u2019s territory, and numerous other terrorist and \ninsurgent groups are active in Iraq. Such groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces \nand civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens and western \ncompanies throughout Iraq. U.S. Government and western interests remain possible \ntargets for attacks. Additionally, there are significant human rights problems in Iraq. \nWidespread corruption, as well as abuses by Iraqi security forces in response to acts of \nviolence by terrorists and others, have undermined confidence in the Iraqi government \nand its judiciary. Human rights violations by Iraqi law enforcement are not uncommon and \nare not being addressed when identified. Those include killing, kidnapping, and extorting \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \ncivilians, as well as inhumane conditions in detention and prison facilities, arbitrary arrest \nand lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits on freedom of expression, \nfreedom of the press, censorship of religion, limits on peaceful assembly, and societal \nabuses of women. The various terrorist and militia organizations are also responsible for \nsignificant human rights abuses in Iraq. \n \n \nApplicant is loyal to the United States and expressed pride in the work he does for \nthe U.S. military. All of his personal and financial assets are in this country. Beginning in \nJanuary 2017, he provided his wife in Iraq about $300 each month for support; however, \nthat support stopped when his wife immigrated to the United States in June 2018. \nApplicant has not provided financial support to anyone else in Iraq. He is registered to \nvote in the United States and he meets all of his income tax reporting obligations as \nrequired. In September 2018, Applicant received a master\u2019s degree in business \nadministration from a U.S. university. (Answer; GX 3; AX I - M; AX B; AX S; AX W; Tr. 28 \n\u2013 31) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; see also AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is stated at AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate family now resides in the United States. His parents, one of \nhis three brothers, and his infant child are U.S. citizens. Only his wife has permanent \nresident alien status. He still has numerous relatives on his mother\u2019s side who are citizens \nof and live in Iraq. Many of them have or had longstanding connections to the current Iraqi \ngovernment. He also has several friends who live in Iraq, some of whom have similar \ngovernmental connections. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents and sisters live in Iraq and she has \nregular contact with them. He does not communicate directly with them and he claims he \ndoes not have close relationships with them. Nonetheless, his close relationship with his \nwife and her close ties of affection to her parents and sisters create a rebuttable \npresumption that he has close relationships to her family. Aside from his claims he does \nnot have contact with his wife\u2019s family, Applicant did not present information that would \nrebut that presumption. \n \nAs to whether Iraq presents a heightened risk of pressure or coercion, Applicant \nhas had firsthand experience with threats of physical violence from factions inside Iraq. \nHis claims that he has not communicated with anyone he knows in Iraq since 2018, while \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nprudent, is also a recognition of the security issues associated with personal contacts in \nIraq. Combined with information not reasonably subject to dispute about Iraq and the \nunstable environment there, all of the foregoing requires application of the following AG \n\u00b6 7 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n \nBy contrast, I have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 8 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships in Iraq are not casual. Additionally, many of his extended \nfamily members, associates, and in-laws have ties to the Iraqi government. While the Iraqi \ngovernment itself might not act to pressure or coerce those contacts, the instability and \nlack of respect for civil liberties engendered by Iraq\u2019s inability to stabilize its internal affairs \nposes a very real threat to U.S. persons and interests there. Those same issues have \ngiven rise to terrorists and radical militias known to target U.S. citizens and those who \nside with U.S. interests in Iraq.  \n \nApplicant has lived and worked in the United States since 2009. Although his \nsense of loyalty to the United States is significant, that information is not sufficient to \noutweigh the heightened risk of coercion presented by the presence of his extended \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nfamily, his wife\u2019s family, and other associates in Iraq. I conclude none of the AG \u00b6 8 factors \ncan be applied here. The security concerns about foreign influence are not mitigated. \n \nI also evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2(d). It cannot be disputed that Applicant is a loyal American citizen and is dedicated to \nhis work with the military overseas. He recently married and started a family. In the context \nof assessing an individual\u2019s suitability for access to classified information, however, his \ncircumstances must be examined with the protection of the national interest in mind. \nThese decisions are a recognition of the heightened risks associated with Applicant\u2019s \nclose ties of affection for persons who reside in a country known, in this case, to present \na very real danger to those persons from groups seeking to harm U.S. interests. The state \nof affairs in Iraq and Applicant\u2019s personal ties in that country sustain doubts about the \nsuitability of granting him access to classified information. Because protection of the \ninterests of national security is the principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts \nmust be resolved against the Applicant\u2019s request for clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to \nhave access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the July 12, 2019 SOR, Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he owes $8,512 in past-due federal income taxes for tax year 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Additionally, the SOR alleges that he owes $51,878 in delinquent credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d and 1.f-1.i) and $11,821 on a charged-off vehicle lease (SOR \u00b6 1.e). When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he denied that he had failed to timely file federal income tax returns, but he admitted owing the alleged debts. He presented documentation showing that he was in an installment repayment plan for his federal taxes for tax year 2014. (Items 1-2.) After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 2), I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 59-year-old college graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in May 1983. He served as an officer in a branch of the National Guard from May 1982 to May 1983 and as an officer in the inactive reserve from March 1983 to February 1985. He has been married to his current spouse since July 2013. He was married to his first wife from October 1983 to March 2012. He has two sons, ages 21 and 26, from that marriage. (Items 3-4.)

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had no record of him filing a return for \ntax year 2018 as of May 2019. Since July 2016, Applicant has been repaying his past-due \nincome taxes for tax year 2014, but he has made little progress toward resolving more than \n$69,000 in consumer-credit debts charged off or placed for collection. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 12, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn July 29, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 5, 2019, the \nGovernment submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of nine exhibits \n(Items 1-9). The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) forwarded a copy of the \nFORM to Applicant on September 6, 2019, and instructed him that any response was due \nwithin 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on September 16, 2019. No \nresponse was received by the October 16, 2019 deadline. On November 26, 2019, the \ncase was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case \nfile on December 5, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the July 12, 2019 SOR, Applicant \nfailed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, \nand 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he owes $8,512 in past-due federal income taxes for tax \nyear 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Additionally, the SOR alleges that he owes $51,878 in delinquent \ncredit-card debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d and 1.f-1.i) and $11,821 on a charged-off vehicle lease \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he denied that he had failed \nto timely file federal income tax returns, but he admitted owing the alleged debts. He \npresented documentation showing that he was in an installment repayment plan for his \nfederal taxes for tax year 2014. (Items 1-2.) After considering the FORM, which includes \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 2), I make the following findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old college graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in May \n1983. He served as an officer in a branch of the National Guard from May 1982 to May \n1983 and as an officer in the inactive reserve from March 1983 to February 1985. He has \nbeen married to his current spouse since July 2013. He was married to his first wife from \nOctober 1983 to March 2012. He has two sons, ages 21 and 26, from that marriage. (Items \n3-4.) \n \nApplicant worked as a civilian project manager for a branch of the U.S. military from \nSeptember 2001 to November 2004. He held a DOD secret clearance for that job. As of \nJune 2002, he was making payments on a credit-card account in collection and on $6,789 \nin student-loan debt. A federal tax lien of $13,011, filed in October 1997, was satisfied in \nApril 2003. (Item 9.) He left federal service for a director\u2019s position with a defense \ncontractor in November 2004, and while in that job, his clearance eligibility was upgraded \nto top secret in December 2012. He stayed on with his then employer after a corporate \nmerger, but in 2014, the new company ceased operating due to financial problems. \nApplicant worked as a consultant from April 2014 to January 2015 for a company that \nserviced federal and state agencies. In January 2015, he began his current employment in \nthe defense industry as the director of a company that manufactures custom mechanical \nsystems. (Items 3-4.) \n\n3 \n \nOn April 14, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on which he responded \u201cYes\u201d to an \ninquiry concerning whether, in the last seven years, he had failed to file or pay federal, \nstate, or other taxes, when required by law or ordinance. He indicated that he had worked \nas a consultant in 2014 and failed to have enough taxes withheld. He commented that he \nwas currently repaying an $8,500 tax debt for tax year 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) at $185 a month \nto the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under a repayment plan. In response to inquiries \nconcerning any delinquency involving routine accounts in the last seven years, Applicant \nlisted a $16,000 auto-lease debt for a vehicle \u201creturned\u201d (voluntarily surrendered) in 2015 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). He explained that he had to pay child support and medical expenses for his \nspouse. (Item 3.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on June 21, 2017, revealed several credit-card \ndelinquencies. A credit card with an $8,140 balance was past due 30 days for $163 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.g). Two credit-card accounts obtained from a bank were in collection for $16,219 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c) and $10,606 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) with no activity on the accounts since 2015. A credit-card \naccount opened in February 2013 was placed in collection for $3,346 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). A credit-\ncard debt from December 2015 was in collection for $4,040 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). A credit-card debt \nof $12,900 from January 2016 had a collection balance of $14,072 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). He \nreportedly owed $11,698 on the defaulted automobile lease (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant was \nmaking timely payments on a credit card with a balance of $154; on a car loan obtained for \n$4,046 in December 2014 with a $1,116 balance; and on a mortgage balance of $209,585. \nHe obtained the mortgage in June 2012 for $231,282. (Item 7.) \n \nOn August 14, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked about his financial delinquencies, \nApplicant did not dispute the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e. He indicated that the debts were \nincurred because his spouse was unemployed and had significant medical issues that were \nnot covered by insurance. Additionally, he had to remain current with his child support \npayments. Concerning the credit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant stated that he was \nworking on a settlement offer and expected to have a payment plan in place no later than \nOctober 2018. As for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which he admitted was in collection, he stated \nthat he would contact the collection entity about a possible settlement and repayment plan \nby October 2018. Regarding the lease for the surrendered vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.e), Applicant \nindicated that he was awaiting correspondence from the creditor about any deficiency \nbalance. When asked whether he had any other delinquent accounts, Applicant \nvolunteered that he had a second account with the bank identified in SOR \u00b6 1.f on which \nhe settled a $2,250 balance for $640 paid in three installments. He denied any other \ndelinquencies, but then did not dispute the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i when \nconfronted. Applicant indicated that the creditor owed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i \nrefused to settle and wanted lump-sum payments that he could not afford. He expressed \nhis intention to pay the debts. As for the credit card that was 30 days past due (SOR \u00b6 1.g), \nApplicant indicated that the account was closed and had never been over 120 days \ndelinquent. Applicant denied he was delinquent on any federal state or local income taxes, \nexplaining that he was current on his payment plan with the IRS for his 2014 taxes. (Item \n4.) \n\n4 \n \n \nIn response to May 9, 2019 interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant provided proof of \nhis installment plan for his federal income tax delinquency for tax year 2014. He also \nsubmitted requested IRS account transcripts for tax years 2011 through 2015 and 2017 \nthrough 2018. Applicant indicated that his account transcript for tax year 2016 was not \navailable on the IRS\u2019 system because of identity theft. In response to a June 13, 2019 \nrequest from Applicant for his tax transcript, the IRS informed him that the IRS was unable \nto process the requested tax year at this time, but that he could contact the identity theft \nnumber for any tax year not available. (Item 5.) \nApplicant made no progress toward resolving his delinquent credit-card balances by \nMarch 2019. Contrary to what Appellant had claimed during his OPM interview, the account \nin SOR \u00b6 1.g had become $3,595 past due and was charged off. He reportedly owed \n$8,923 on the account as of March 2019. Additionally, a $295 medical debt from February \n2018 was in collection (not alleged in SOR). (Item 6.) \n \nApplicant submits that he has filed all of his federal tax returns according to IRS tax \nrequirements. However, tax account transcripts from the IRS (Item 5) show that he filed \nlate returns for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2014. Relevant tax information as reported by \nthe IRS is set forth in the following table. \nT \nTax Year \nFiling Date \nAdjusted \nGross \nIncome (AGI) \nBalance due \n2011 \nJune 11, 2012; on \nAugust \n27, \n2012 \nassessed penalty for \nlate return \n$178,540 as married $0 as of October 26, \n2015 \n2012 \nOctober 22, 2013; \nhad \nextension \nto \nOctober 15, 2013 \n$110,140 as single \n$0 as of October 9, \n2017 \n2013 \nJune 27, 2014; had \nextension to October \n15, 2014 \n$18,203 as married \nper IRS transcript \nbut $23,849 in W-2 \nwithholdings \n$0 as of October 26, \n2015; tax refunded \nby IRS of $23,927 \nSeptember 26, 2014. \n2014 \nOctober 20, 2015; \nhad \nextension \nto \nOctober 15, 2015  \n$198,937 as married $8,521 as of June \n24, 2019 \n2015 \nApril 15, 2016 \n$96,102 as married \n$0 as of December \n4, \n2017; \n$5,174 \nrefund credited to \ntax year 2014 on \nApril 15, 2016 \n2016 \nNo IRS transcript \navailable; \nAsserts \ntimely filed April 15, \n2016 [sic]  \nAGI not available \nAsserts $0 owed \n \n\n5 \n \n \n2017 \n \nApril 15, 2018 \n$137,747 \n$0 as of August 27, \n2018 \n2018 \nAsserts timely filed \nApril 15, 2018 [sic]; \nIRS had no record of \nreturn as of May 13, \n2019. \nAGI not available  \nPaid $3,268 on April \n17, 2019 \n \n \nThe $18,203 AGI for tax year 2013 does not seem accurate, given his W-2 \nwithholdings were $23,849. There is no explanation in the record to explain the low AGI. \nThe IRS tax transcript for tax year 2014 shows that Applicant had only $8,143 in federal \nincome taxes withheld on a tax liability of $50,518 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He had worked for a \ncompany until April 2014 that year, which explains the withholdings. He apparently made \nlittle or no tax payments on his income as a consultant. Concerning repayment of \ndelinquent taxes for 2014, the IRS tax transcript shows that he made a payment to the IRS \nof $7,339 on April 15, 2015. When he filed his return on October 20, 2015, five days past \nthe extended deadline, he paid $13,792 with his return. He was penalized $1,369 plus \n$656 for late payment. On January 14, 2016, Applicant entered into an installment \nagreement to repay his tax delinquency at $185 per month. His tax refund of $5,174 for tax \nyear 2015 was credited to his account on April 15, 2016, and he made a payment of \n$5,880 on May 31, 2016. His payments under the installment agreement began on July 21, \n2016. As of June 24, 2019, the IRS was reporting a balance owed of $8,521 for tax year \n2014. (Item 5.) \n \n \nOn July 22, 2019, Applicant received the SOR alleging financial considerations, \nbecause of his outstanding tax delinquency for tax year 2014 and unpaid consumer-credit \ndelinquencies. When he responded to the SOR allegations on July 29, 2019, he denied \nlate filing of returns but admitted the debts. (Item 2.) Applicant received the Government\u2019s \nFORM on September 16, 2019. Applicant presented no evidence of any payments on the \nseven consumer-credit delinquencies alleged in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.i) either in \nresponse to the SOR or the FORM. The IRS tax transcripts report some income \ninformation for Applicant, but he provided no information about his monthly expenses apart \nfrom his $185 monthly payment to the IRS. Applicant also provided no information about \nthe extent of his spouse\u2019s medical expenses or his child support payments that reportedly \ncaused his financial difficulties. \n                                                                                                                                                \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \n\n6 \n \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \n\n7 \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to comply with \nhis tax filing obligations whether or not any taxes are owed. Available IRS tax transcripts for \nApplicant show that he filed his income tax returns late for tax years 2011 (almost two \nmonths late), 2012 (one week late), and 2014 (five days late). His tax returns were filed on \ntime for tax years 2013, 2015, and 2017. No tax transcript was available for tax year 2016, \nwhich Applicant claims was filed on time. He also asserts that he filed a timely federal \nincome tax return for tax 2018. The IRS had no record of receiving a return as of May 13, \n2019, although it had received a tax payment of $3,268 on April 17, 2019. The tax filing \ndeadline was April 15, 2019. See www.irs.gov. It is unclear whether he filed for an \nextension of the filing deadline for 2018.  \n \nThe tax transcript for tax year 2014 shows that he underpaid his federal income \ntaxes by more than $42,000 when he worked as a consultant. After payments of $7,339 in \nApril 2015 and $13,792 with his return on October 20, 2015, he entered into an installment \nagreement with the IRS in January 2016. As of June 24, 2019, he had reduced his tax \ndelinquency to $8,521 for tax year 2014. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required,\u201d applies because of his late tax \nfilings for several tax years and his substantial tax delinquency for tax year 2014. \n \nThe evidence also establishes a record of substantial consumer-credit delinquency \nthat implicates disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d In addition to the $11,821 charged-off balance \non the auto lease (SOR \u00b6 1.e), Applicant defaulted on his payments on the six credit cards \nalleged in the SOR. As of March 2019, the balances on those accounts totaled \napproximately $57,206. \n  \n\n8 \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his late tax filings and delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid \ndisqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20. One or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant explained that he experienced financial difficulties because of his spouse\u2019s \nout-of-pocket medical expenses and his child support payments when his spouse was \nunemployed. He presented no evidence of whether her medical issues are ongoing and \nunlikely to recur. Even if his spouse\u2019s medical illness is considered a unique circumstance \nof the type contemplated within AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant benefitted from the credit extended \nto him, and he has yet to make any payments toward the consumer-credit delinquencies \nalleged in the SOR, which became seriously past due between 2015 and 2017. The debts \nare considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a \ncontinuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the \nGuideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply.  \n \n\n9 \n \n \nApplicant has not provided documentation of his spouse\u2019s medical expenses that \ncould substantiate that his debts were caused by unexpected or unforeseen factors \ncontemplated within AG \u00b6 20(b). IRS tax transcripts show some decline in Applicant and \nhis spouse\u2019s income in 2015, when the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, and 1.h became past due. \nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s joint AGI for tax year 2015 was $96,102, a significant decline \nfrom their AGI of $198,937 in 2014 when Applicant worked as a consultant. Income figures \nwere not available for Applicant or his spouse for 2016, when the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.i were charged off. However, their joint AGI rose to $137,747 in tax year 2017. \nApplicant provided no evidence that could reasonably explain or justify his failure to take \nsteps to resolve his delinquencies since 2017. \n \nI have to consider whether Applicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, \n2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, \n2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained contact with his creditors. During his \nOPM interview in August 2018, Applicant indicated that he would try to have repayment \nplans established by October 2018. There is no evidence of any attempts to settle or \nresolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not clearly established. \n \n \nAs of March 2019, Applicant\u2019s credit report showed no progress toward addressing \nhis consumer-credit delinquencies. He has had ample opportunity to provide evidence of \nactions taken, if any, to make payments on his delinquent consumer credit debts, and he \nsubmitted no evidence of any payments. Neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) can \nreasonably apply in mitigation. AG \u00b6 20(e) was also not established because the debts are \nundisputed. \n \nApplicant has a credible case for some mitigation of his late tax filing and tax \npayment issues. While the Government argued in the FORM that Applicant has \nconsistently filed his federal income tax returns past their due dates, the IRS transcripts \nshow some reform by Applicant in that his federal income tax returns were filed on time for \ntax years 2013, 2015, and 2017. He asserts, without corroboration, that he also filed his \nincome tax returns on time for tax years 2016 and 2018. With respect to tax year 2016, \nwhere no tax transcript was provided, the Government\u2019s case for a late filing was not \nproven. Concerning tax year 2018, whereas the IRS tax transcript shows no record of a \nreturn having been filed by May 13, 2019, or of any request for a filing extension, Applicant \nhas the burden to prove that he filed a timely tax return, and he presented no \ndocumentation to corroborate his claim that he filed a return on April 15, 2019. Applicant\u2019s \ntimely installment payments to the IRS since July 2016 sufficiently mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by his tax indebtedness. AG \u00b6 20(g) has some applicability because his \ndelinquent federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2014 were filed well \nbefore the SOR was issued; his federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2015, and \n2017 were filed on time; and he has demonstrated a sufficient track record of timely \npayments for his 2014 income tax debt to safely conclude that he is likely to continue to \nmake his payments. Absent proof that he filed his federal income tax return for tax year \n2018 on time, some concern arises about whether he can be counted on to file his tax \n\n10 \n \nreturns on time in the future. That being said, at this time, the primary concern is with his \nfailure to take any steps to address his substantial consumer-credit delinquencies. His \nongoing disregard raises considerable doubts as to whether he can be counted on to \ncomply with security requirements. The financial considerations security concerns are not \nsufficiently mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on him to \nprovide the evidence that might extenuate or mitigate the poor judgment raised by his \nhistory of late tax filings and his outstanding delinquent debt. Although Applicant has \nexpressed an intention to resolve his debts, promises to pay at some future date are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of payments. It is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against \nthe grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 \n(9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the evidence \npresented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n11 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

A Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nwas issued under Guideline F, financial considerations, due to six collection accounts, \ndelinquent Federal income tax, and a state tax lien. He provided sufficient evidence \naddressing his financial difficulties and delinquent obligations. Financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn May 24, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, financial considerations, under which it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DoD CAF \nacted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \n\n2 \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information \n(AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn July 1, 2019, Applicant answered the Guideline F allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). (SOR Response) On September 3, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \nscheduling a hearing to be conducted on September 26, 2019. On September 10, 2019, \nfor good cause the hearing was cancelled. On December 12, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice \nof Hearing scheduling a hearing that was conducted on January 17, 2020. \n \nNine Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 9) were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant and his wife testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on \nJanuary 29, 2020. The record was held open following the hearing to allow Applicant to \nsubmit documentation. On March 2, 2020, six documents were received and admitted \ninto evidence without objection as Ex. A \u2013 F.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he disputed a U.S. Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) debt and admitted the five collection accounts and the indebtedness for \nFederal income taxes and the state tax lien listed in the SOR. After a thorough review of \nthe testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old senior items analyst who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since January 2018 and seeks to obtain a security clearance. (Tr. 6) He \nmarried in December 2013 and has a 16-year-old stepchild. He has two children, ages 8 \nand 10, from previous relationships. (Ex. 1, Tr. 34, 67) He is current on his $1,750 monthly \nchild support obligations. (Tr. 43) In January 2020, his 8-year-old son moved to the same \nstate where Applicant resides, which may lessen the amount of support he will have to \npay for his son. His annual salary is currently approximately $97,500. (Tr. 46) Overtime \npay is possible with his position, which would increase his yearly income. (Tr. 46)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is currently not working outside of the home, but is currently \nreceiving approximately $4,000 monthly in workers\u2019 compensation due to an on-the-job \ninjury incurred in November 2019. (Tr. 46, 48, 50) She is currently in physical therapy. \n(Tr. 49) When injured, she was a senior logistics coordinator working in Iraq. (Tr. 49, 51) \nShe worked in Iraq in 2012 and 2013 and again from 2018 to 2019. (Tr. 52) He met his \nwife when both were working as contractors at the same overseas location.  \n \nFrom March 2004 to February 2012, Applicant honorably served on active duty \nwith the Army National Guard. He separated as a staff sergeant (E-6). (Ex. 2, Tr. 26) \nWhile on active duty, he had two tours to Iraq and one tour to Afghanistan. (Tr. 30) The \nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs rates Applicant\u2019s disability at 70 percent due to post \ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). (Tr. 9) His retirement and disability pay is approximately \n$1,600 monthly. (Tr. 9) From February 2012 to May 2016, he worked as a civilian \ncontractor at Bagram, Afghanistan. (Ex. 2, Tr. 34) While overseas for two years, he gave \n\n3 \nhis sister $500 monthly. (Tr. 36-37) He continues to provide a few hundred dollars monthly \nin financial assistance to his two younger sisters and younger brother. (Tr. 37, 40) \n \nApplicant got behind on his finances when he returned from overseas. When he \nreturned, he obtained a job at a much reduced salary. (Tr. 54) His salary went from \nbetween $87,000 and $133,000 per year, when he was working overseas, to $32,000 to \n$36,000 annually when he returned to the United States. (Tr. 54)The cost of living and \nhis child support obligations also contributed to his inability to pay his obligations. \n \nThe SOR alleges six collection non-tax debts totaling $9,811 of which three are \nDepartment of Education accounts that total $4,131. One of the collection accounts was \na $4,416 VA debt (SOR 1.f), which Applicant disputed. He owed $10,079 in Federal \nincome tax for tax years 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017 (SOR 1.g). He was $1,665 \ndelinquent for a state income tax lien (SOR 1.h). In 2018 a state tax lien was entered for \ntax year 2013. (Tr. 67) He had filed his 2013 state income tax return in April 2014. (Ex. E, \nTr. 24, 66) He has been repaying his Federal tax delinquency under a repayment \nagreement established with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in February 2017. \n \nApplicant incurred a $1,026 debt for the purchase of a computer (SOR 1.a). (Tr. \n54) The account had gone to collection, but the debt was paid in July 2019. (Ex. A, Tr. 8) \nFour times he requested documentation from the creditor showing the debt has been \npaid, but received no response. (Ex. A) He incurred a $238 debt (SOR 1.b) for insurance \nthat went to collection. The debt was incurred when he changed insurance companies. \n(Ex. 4) The debt was paid in June 2019. (Ex. B) He has an installment agreement to pay \nthe three Department of Education collection accounts (SOR 1.c, $480; SOR 1.d, $1,101, \nand SOR 1.e, $2,550). (SOR Response) As of February 2019, the amount owed on his \nthree Department of Education accounts was $4,890. (SOR Response) As of the hearing \ndate, the amount owed was $3,800. (Tr. 59) In January 2020, he paid $1,000 and entered \ninto a repayment agreement to pay the education debts by April 2020. (Tr. 20, Ex. C, Ex. \nE) \n \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR, he disputed the VA $4,416 collection \naccount (SOR 1.f). Applicant believes the debt may have been incurred for personal \nequipment that he asserted he had turned in when he left the National Guard. (Tr. 23) He \nhad turned in the equipment and received a hand receipt, but believed he was still being \nheld responsible for the equipment. (Tr. 23) The debt was paid in full on August 28, 2014. \n(Ex. D) \n \nApplicant hired an accounting firm to submit his Federal income tax returns. (Ex.3 \npage 29) For tax years 2011 and 2012, he received Federal tax refunds of $1,093 and \n$1,214. (Ex. 3 pages 7, 8) For tax year 2013, he owed Federal income tax of $5,497 on \nan income of $133,134. (Ex. 3 pages 10, 11, 30, 36, and 37) For tax year 2014, he \nreceived a $280 refund on income of $89,329. (Ex. 3 page 45) For tax year 2015, he \nowed $1,687 in Federal income tax on income of $87,354. (Ex. 3 pages 13, 15) For tax \nyear 2016, he received a tax refund of $328. (Ex. 3, pages 19, 26, and 59) The IRS \napplied $185 of his refund to his 2012 Federal income tax debt. (Ex. 3 page 26) \n\n4 \n \nIn April 2014, Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS to \nrepay his tax indebtedness then at $5,497. (Ex. 3 page 34, SOR Response) That \ninstallment agreement ended when a required monthly payment was not made. In \nFebruary 2017, he made another repayment agreement with the IRS to have $185 \nautomatically deducted monthly from his checking account. (Ex. 4, Ex. D, Tr. 24, Tr. 25, \nTr. 76) The installment agreement with the IRS covers the $10,079 in taxes owed for tax \nyears 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017 (SOR 1.g). He provided documentation showing he \nmade six monthly payments of $185 each: in August 2019, September 2019, October \n2019, November 2019, January 2020, and February 2020. (Ex. E). He also made a $190 \npayment in September 2019 and a $500 payment in January 2020. (Ex. E, Tr. 76) His \ntotal payments since August 2019 have been $1,960. Additionally, tax refunds were \nintercepted and applied to his tax liability. (Tr. 78)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s August 2018 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), he acknowledged he had failed to file or pay his Federal income tax \nas required by law, and he acknowledged the state tax lien. (Ex. 1) He explained that he \nmarried in 2013 and did not file his taxes in that state because he resided in another state. \nThe state informed him he owed $9,300, however the tax lien was for $1,665. As of \nJanuary 21, 2020, he had no state tax liability. (Ex. F) \n \nApplicant and his wife are current on their monthly vehicle payments of $442 and \n$500 each. (Tr. 45-46) They are current on their $1,450 monthly rent. (Tr. 47) He is not \nreceiving calls or letters from creditors demanding payment. The move to his current \nlocation resulted in him paying $1,000 less in rent, $200 less in transportation expenses, \nand having a lower cost of living. Applicant believes he has $1,500 to $1,700 per month \nmore income to address his debts following his move to his current state. (Tr. 81) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n\n5 \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \n\n6 \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d and (f) \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d  \n \n  \nApplicant admitted the delinquent obligations in the SOR except, as noted, the VA \ndebt, which he disputed. He owed Federal income taxes and had a state tax lien entered \nagainst him. The record having established disqualifying conditions, additional inquiry \nabout the possible applicability of mitigating conditions is required. Applicant has the \nburden of establishing mitigation. Five financial considerations mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that he \nhas paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). The Appeal Board stated in ISCR \nCase No. 17-00263 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan \n\n7 \nfor debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences \na serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not numerous nor is the total amount of debt \nextremely large. He had owed six collection debts totaling less than $10,000 and had two \ntax obligations totaling less than $12,000. Three of the six collection accounts were for \nstudent loans, which initially totaled less than $5,000. Applicant has paid the computer \ndebt (SOR 1.a), the insurance debt (SOR 1.b), the VA debt (SOR 1.f), and the state tax \nlien (SOR 1.f). He is making payments on the remaining two obligations, the student loans \nand Federal tax debt (SOR 1.c \u2013 1.e and SOR 1.g). AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the debts he \nhas paid and the additional debts that he has been repaying under established repayment \nagreements. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to the state tax lien, which has been paid and the Federal \ntax debt for which he has a repayment agreement with the IRS and is in compliance with \nthat agreement.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has some applicability as well. When Applicant returned from his \noverseas employment to the United States, his annual income dropped from between \n$133,000 and $87,000 annually to $32,000 annually, which contributed to his financial \ndelinquencies. He made a number of moves, at his expense, before he arrived at his \ncurrent location. His move to his current residence decreased his living expenses by \n$1,500 to $1,700 monthly. His current annual salary is approximately $97,500. His VA \ndisability payment is an additional $19,000 annually. His wife\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation is \ncurrently $4,000 monthly. Although AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because he has not \nreceived financially counseling, there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved and is under control.  \n \nAn applicant is not required to establish that he has paid each of the delinquent \ndebts in the SOR. An applicant needs to show that he has a plan to resolve his debts and \nthat he has taken significant steps to implement his plan. This he has done. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n8 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. The comments under Guideline F are incorporated in the whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s service to the \nU.S. military in hostile territory with two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. His military \nservice merits considerable respect. Additionally, I considered his work as a civilian \ncontractor in Afghanistan from February 2012 to May 2016, which also merits respect.  \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. Applicant had a small \namount of student loans in collection, originally under $5,000, which had been reduced \nto $3,800 at the time of the hearing. He has since made a sizable $1,000 payment and \nmade an arrangement to pay the remainder. He has a repayment agreement with the IRS \nand has provided documentation showing he is honoring that agreement. The other \ndelinquent debts of concern listed in the SOR have been paid. His move to his current \nlocation has sizably reduced his living expenses. He is current on his monthly obligations \nand is not receiving any calls or letters from creditors demanding payment. His finances \nare under control.  \n \nThe law and regulations, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and \nthe AGs, have been carefully applied to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole person. The issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been \npaid, it is whether Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to \nhold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts about his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness or his eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.h:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n\n9 \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Since then, however, he has moderated his drinking and no longer drives \nafter consuming alcohol. He has also matured and become more responsible. He has \nestablished a healthier lifestyle and is pursuing a master\u2019s degree to further his career. \nHe also submitted strong whole-person evidence in support of his case. He has shown \nthat his alcohol issues are in the past and unlikely to recur. Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from his alcohol involvement, and the cross-alleged personal \nconduct security concerns. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for continued access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline G (alcohol involvement). The same facts were cross-alleged under \nGuideline E (personal conduct). The DOD CAF issued the SOR under Executive Order \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 15, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The case \nwas assigned to me on December 12, 2019. On January 14, 2020, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling the hearing for February 4, 2020.  \n \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted Government\u2019s \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant and three \ncharacter witnesses testified. Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through I, \nwhich were admitted without objection. AE A through AE F were included with his Answer. \nI held the record open to allow him the opportunity to submit additional documentation. \nHe subsequently submitted two documents from his alcohol counselor, dated February \n6, 2020, and February 14, 2020, respectively. I marked them as AE J and AE K, and they \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February \n13, 2020. The record closed on February 18, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and the cross-allegation, SOR \u00b6 2.a, with \nexplanations. I have incorporated his admissions and statements into the findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old. He was married from 2004 to 2011 and he has a 17-\nyear-old son from this marriage, which ended in divorce. He remarried in 2014. He and \nhis wife have a three-year old daughter. (GE 2 at 5) Applicant graduated from high school \nin 2002. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 2005 to 2009, and was discharged \nhonorably. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2013 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. \n(GE 1) In early 2020, he was accepted into a master\u2019s degree program. (AE H) Applicant \nhas held a security clearance since 2005. He has worked for his current employer, a \ndefense contractor, since April 2009, shortly after leaving the Air Force. (Tr. 26-29, 36-\n38, 67; GE 1) He has an annual salary of $100,000. (Tr. 73) \n \nIn September 2013, Applicant went to a pool hall after work. He consumed a \npitcher of beer over the course of the evening. While driving home, he was pulled over by \npolice for having a light out on his car. He failed a roadside sobriety test, registering a \nblood alcohol content of 0.06. A search of his car revealed a container of marijuana. \n(Answer; Tr. 30) \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol \n(DUI) and possession of marijuana. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) In March 2014, through a plea \n\n \n3 \n \n \nagreement, the DUI charge was dismissed, and the marijuana possession charge was \nreduced to possession of drug paraphernalia, to which Applicant pleaded guilty. He \nreceived a 90-day suspended jail term and two years of unsupervised probation. He was \nrequired to attend four meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), to attend a 48-hour drug \nrehabilitation program, and to submit to random drug screenings. Applicant completed \nthe requirements of probation in late June 2014. (Answer; AE A; GE 2 at 8, 11; GE 3; Tr. \n30-37) He has not used illegal drugs since his 2013 offense. He recognizes that using \nmarijuana, particularly with a clearance, was a very poor decision. (Tr. 41, 54, 67) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his 2013 arrest occurred in the aftermath of a family tragedy. \nHis sister, who had suffered from a severe mental impairment due to a car accident as a \nteenager years before, passed away in April 2013 at age 27. Applicant did not pursue \ngrief counseling. He dealt with his grief by self-medicating with marijuana from May to \nSeptember 2013. He also went out drinking with friends. (Tr. 30-34, 40-41, 46, 68-69) \nApplicant described his drinking pattern at the time as \u201csevere.\u201d He consumed six drinks \na day, and \u201cupwards of 10 sometimes on weekends.\u201d (Tr. 46)  \n \n \nApplicant abstained from drinking for about six months after his 2013 DUI. He \nresumed drinking during his honeymoon in August 2014. He limited his drinking \nsomewhat. He would consume two or three beers with dinner a few nights a week and \nsix beers on weekends. He also continued to go out drinking on occasion. (Tr. 46-47, 50-\n54, 69-70, 74)  \n \n \n \nIn July 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) to renew \nhis clearance. He disclosed his 2013 offense. (GE 1)  \n \nIn August 2017, Applicant was out with family members celebrating his wife\u2019s \nbirthday. He consumed two or three beers over a three-hour period. While driving home, \nhe drove off the road while looking at his cell phone, striking a telephone pole. Applicant \nrefused to take a roadside field sobriety test, and he was arrested on a charge of DUI. \n(Answer; GE 2 at 5-6; GE 3; Tr. 55-56) (SOR \u00b6 2.a) Applicant does not believe he was \nintoxicated at the time. (Tr. 74) He acknowledged that, unlike with the 2013 offense, there \nwas no real triggering event for the 2017 DUI beyond his own poor decision making. (Tr. \n70)  \n \nIn February 2018, Applicant was found guilty of DUI. He was fined and received a \n60-day suspended jail term and two years of probation. He appealed to the circuit court. \n(GE 3) In August 2018, Applicant entered a diversion program. He was ordered to pay \ncourt costs and fees, to perform 100 hours of community service, to participate in an \nalcohol evaluation, to attend a victim-impact panel, and to attend four AA meetings. \nApplicant completed the requirements in April 2019, and the charge was dismissed in \nJune 2019. (Answer; AE B; GE 2, GE 4, GE 5; Tr. 56-60) \n \nAs part of the diversion program, Applicant participated in alcohol counseling from \nNovember 2018 until April 2019. In his initial screening in November 2018, Applicant was \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndiagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \nMental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) by a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. (AE C; \nTr. 41-44) \n \n \nApplicant testified that the counseling program involved weekly group meetings for \neight weeks. He had to abstain from drinking during the program. He said he benefited \nsignificantly from the program, and credited his participation in counseling with changing \nhis priorities. He became more goal-oriented. (Tr. 47-49) Applicant\u2019s counselor submitted \na letter of recommendation noting that Applicant completed the program successfully and \nattesting to Applicant\u2019s maintenance of a healthy lifestyle. (AE E, AE G) \n \n \nAfter his second DUI, Applicant stopped going to pool halls and started going to \nthe gym. He ceased drinking during the week. He testified that when he drank alcohol \noutside the home, he would use ride-share programs to return to his home. Applicant is \nnow in a management position at work and knows the potential impact his actions would \nhave on his career. (Tr. 60-62, 71; AE C) He said he was last intoxicated at a party at his \nhouse on New Year\u2019s Eve in December 2019, when he consumed three or four beers \nover the course of the evening. (Tr. 74-75)  \n \nApplicant participated in court-ordered AA and a few additional sessions. He felt \nthat he did not benefit from his participation in AA. (Tr. 72-73) He had two subsequent \nappointments with his counselor, but is not currently in alcohol counseling or AA. (Tr. 41-\n45, 60, 75; AE G)  \n \n \nApplicant feels his alcohol consumption is now under control. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t need \nit\u201d to relax or to \u201cde-stress\u201d (Tr. 63-64) Applicant recognized that it took the second DUI \nfor him to change his outlook. He blamed the first DUI on events in his life and on his drug \nuse. He is now more focused on professional advancement and on his family. He accepts \nfull responsibility for his actions. (Tr. 116-119) \n \nIn February 2020, Applicant submitted documentation from his alcohol counselor, \nwho found that Applicant does not meet the diagnostic criteria for any alcohol use or \nsubstance abuse disorders under the DSM-5. As a result, no treatment was \nrecommended. (AE J, AE K) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father testified that Applicant is a dedicated father and a good son. \nThey are very close. He said he was not aware that his son had a drinking problem. \nApplicant\u2019s father, who served in the Air Force and held a clearance, regards his son as \nvery trustworthy. They do not talk about Applicant\u2019s work, but instead discuss their shared \ninterests, like college sports. (Tr. 78-85) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that he is a good father. He is very intelligent and tactful. \nShe is very proud of him for being so driven and goal-oriented. Applicant does not drink \nto excess. (Tr. 100-104) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor testified that Applicant has worked for him for 11 \nyears. Applicant informed him about his two arrests when they occurred. Applicant has a \ngreat work ethic. He is \u201ca bright and upcoming star.\u201d He is trusted and liked in the \nworkplace. Applicant knows what he did was wrong. The supervisor testified that \u201cI would \ntrust him with my life.\u201d (Tr. 87-98; AE E, AE F) A coworker of Applicant\u2019s provided a letter \nof recommendation expressing similar sentiments. (AE E)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nNo one has a right to a security clearance. As the Supreme Court held in \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist; psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) or alcohol use disorder.  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for DUI in 2013 and 2017. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. At the time \nof his 2013 DUI, Applicant was drinking six beers a day, and upwards of ten beers on the \nweekends. This constitutes habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, and AG \u00b6 22(c) applies.  \n \n \nWhen he was assessed by his alcohol counselor in November 2018, Applicant was \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder. AG \u00b6 22(d) would therefore apply but for the fact \nthat the diagnosis is not alleged in the SOR. I therefore cannot consider it as disqualifying \nconduct. Thus, AG \u00b6 22(d) does not technically apply. However, I will consider the \ndiagnosis, as well as the more recent update to it, and Applicant\u2019s subsequent actions, in \nweighing mitigation or changed circumstances, whether Applicant has demonstrated \nsufficient rehabilitation, under the whole-person concept, and in weighing his credibility. \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations.  \n \n \nApplicant incurred DUI charges in 2013 and 2017. Both of them occurred while he \nhad a clearance, and the second happened after he submitted his most recent clearance \napplication, a fact which weighs against mitigation. However, the first DUI occurred during \na period when Applicant was grieving the loss of his sister and also dealing with the end \nof his first marriage.  \n \n \nAs Applicant acknowledges, it took the second DUI for him to address his alcohol \nissues and curtail his drinking to a responsible level. Applicant completed alcohol \ncounseling and now drinks responsibly. He drinks at home, and if he drinks when he is \nout, his wife drives them home or he uses a ride-share service.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol abuse disorder was not alleged as disqualifying \nconduct, though it is supported by the record evidence. However, Applicant also provided \nupdated documentation from his counselor to show that he no longer has an alcohol \nabuse disorder. Applicant has also found new hobbies (working out) and has chosen to \nadvance his education by pursuing a master\u2019s degree. He also has a wife and a young \nchild. He fully appreciates the responsibility he has to provide for his family. He credibly \nattested that he has matured significantly and become more responsible and rightly \nrecognizes that, having had two DUIs, he has much to lose by further acts of poor \njudgment. Applicant also presented strong whole-person evidence from both his family \nmembers and his supervisor that support his case in mitigation. Applicant has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption and changed \nbehavior. I therefore conclude that Applicant has demonstrated that his alcohol issues \nare unlikely to recur and are no longer a security concern. He has provided sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the alcohol-related security issues under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b).  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that \nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is a cross-allegation of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. In addition to the DUI \noffenses, which are addressed above under Guideline G, SOR \u00b6 1.a also includes the \nmarijuana possession charge, which was reduced to possession of drug paraphernalia. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) applies, as does the general personal conduct security concern set forth in \nAG \u00b6 15.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth the applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E:   \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2013 drug-related charges (alleged) and marijuana use while holding \na clearance (not alleged) are additional factors to consider under Guideline E. However, \nlike the 2013 DUI, his drug involvement came in the aftermath of his sister\u2019s death. The \ndrug use is also now several years ago and long past. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) both apply \nfor the same reasons as set forth under Guideline G, above. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and E in \nmy whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the alcohol involvement and personal conduct security \nconcerns. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On May 31, 2019, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline G. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on June 12, 2019, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nAugust 14, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice \nof Hearing on September 20, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 8, \n2019. The Government offered Government Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 6, which were \n\n \n2 \n \nadmitted without objection.

(TR at page 15 line \n1 to page 19 line 5.) He served in the U.S. Army for eight years, has been employed \nwith the defense contractor since 1998, and has held a security clearance for about \u201c20 \nyears.\u201d (Id.)

[Later at his hearing, Applicant defined \u201ca couple of beers and a \ncouple of shots\u201d as \u201cfive/six beers . . . two/three\u201d shots of alcohol.] (TR at page 29 lines \n9~15.) Pursuant to his guilty plea, Applicant paid a $250 fine, and a 90 day jail sentence \nwas suspended. (GX 4.) \n \n \n1.a. In May of 2017, Applicant was arrested, charged and subsequently pled \nguilty to Driving with a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of Over .08%. (TR at page 26 line \n13 to page 37 line 6, and GX 5.) He was at a friend\u2019s house, attending a barbeque. (Id.) \nApplicant consumed \u201cfive/six beers . . . two/three\u201d shots of alcohol. (TR at page 29 lines \n9~15.)  Pursuant to his guilty plea in September of 2017, Applicant paid a $1,839 fine, \nattended counseling, and was placed on probation for three years. (GXs 5 and 6.) He \nhas successfully completed that counseling. (AppX A.) \n \n \nHowever, Applicant remains on probation until September of 2020, and he still \nconsumes alcohol. (TR at page at page 26 line 13 to page 37 line 6, at page 37 lines \n15~22, and GX 5.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n  \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions may apply: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder.  \n \n \nApplicant has two alcohol-related incidents between October of 2009 and May \n2017. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may apply: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant is still on probation as a result of his most recent \nalcohol-related incident, and he still consumes alcohol. Alcohol consumption is found \nagainst Applicant. However, after he completes his probation, and without any further \nalcohol related incidents, Applicant might be successful in reapplying for a security \nclearance. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n5 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is well \nrespected in the work place. (AppX B.)  \n \nHowever, overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Alcohol Consumption security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access \nto sensitive information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on March 21, 2018. On April 24, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him \na Statement of Reasons (SOR), citing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F. The \nDOD acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 23, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 5, 2019, and \nthe case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On August 30, 2019, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nSeptember 25, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 5 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and his wife testified. \n\n \n \n2\nI left the record open until October 9, 2019, to enable Applicant to submit documentary \nevidence. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 15, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2009, \nwhich was discharged in April 2010, and that he has six delinquent debts totaling $29,430. \nThe debts include deficiency balances on two repossessed vehicles totaling $27,191, \nthree credit-card accounts totaling an $8,222, and a $164 medical bill. In his Answer, \nApplicant admits the bankruptcy and the medical debt and denies the other debts. The \ndebts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) from March 2019 and March \n2018, listed on his e-QIP, and discussed during his November 2018 personal subject \ninterview. (GX 4; GX 3.) His admissions in his Answer are incorporated in my findings of \nfact.   \n \nApplicant, 53, has been employed as an aircraft parts cleaner for a defense \ncontractor since February 2018. He and his wife married in 1992 and have five sons: a \n14-year-old who resides with them; a disabled 23-year-old who Applicant supports \nfinancially; and three of whom are independent adults. This is Applicant\u2019s first application \nfor a position of trust. (GX 1; Tr. 57-58.)  \n \n \nApplicant served honorably in the U.S. Army from 1986 until 1990. He worked for \na state\u2019s department of corrections from 1990 until he retired in August 2016 as a \ncommunity corrections center monitor. For many years, Applicant\u2019s wife was unable to \nwork outside the home because she cared for their disabled son. Some of their son\u2019s \nmedications had a $250 co-pay and another medication that was not covered by \ninsurance cost approximately $2,300 per month. Applicant and his wife applied for state \nassistance to help with their son\u2019s expenses, but were denied on the basis that Applicant \nearned too much money. Applicant and his wife were under constant financial strain, living \npaycheck to paycheck, and amassing significant credit-card debt. (Tr. 56-58; GX 3; GX \n5.) \n \n \nIn 2009, as a state employee, Applicant did not receive eight consecutive \npaychecks over a period of four months because the state was unable to reach a budget \nagreement. Applicant and his wife received some financial assistance from other family \nmembers and relied on food banks to feed their family. Ultimately, Applicant received the \nback-pay in a lump sum, which was taxed at a higher rate than his usual income. As a \nresult of this unanticipated period of no income, combined with their ongoing financial \nstrains, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2009. The \nbankruptcy was discharged in April 2010. (Tr. 56-59; GX 5.)  \n  \n \n \nFollowing the discharge of the bankruptcy, Applicant and his wife purchased a \nvehicle because their current vehicle was not running and in an effort to reestablish their \ncredit. It was their understanding that the approximately $20,000 purchase was made \nusing a special financing program under which they would make monthly payments of \n$487, included a 29.5% interest rate, for six months. If they made timely payments, the \n\n \n \n3\ninterest rate would then drop to between 16% and 18%, which would have lowered the \nmonthly payment to $367. However, the creditor did not honor this agreement. Applicant\u2019s \nwife referred to the loan as \u201cpredatory.\u201d Applicant consulted with his bankruptcy attorney \nwho advised him to surrender the vehicle to the bank, which Applicant did. Additionally, \nApplicant and his wife learned in credit counseling, as required by their bankruptcy, that \nthey needed to maintain a strict budget. They could not sustain the $487 car payment for \nthe course of the loan and remain within their tight budget. (Tr. 24-26.) The vehicle was \nsold at auction and the creditor charged the debt off for $10,854. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) The creditor \nhas not made any other contact with Applicant. (Tr. 34-37; GX 3.)  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife purchased a used vehicle in October 2012 for approximately \n$15,000. The purchase was made from a large local dealership with an initial interest rate \nof 14%. It was Applicant and his wife\u2019s understanding that the interest rate would adjust \ndownward after an unspecified period of complying with their payments. The vehicle was \na 2006 model and needed frequent repair, which placed additional pressure on their \nperpetually strained finances. At some point, the dealership sold the loan to another \ncreditor and the interest rate increased. Unable to maintain the payments with their other \nexpenses, Applicant and his wife surrendered the vehicle for repossession. The creditor \nnotified Applicant within 60 to 90 days that the vehicle was sold at auction, but has not \nmade any other contact with Applicant. (Tr. 27-29; Tr. 38-43.)  The account was charged \noff for $16,337 (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) This account shows a $0 on the March 2019 CBR. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife manages the household finances and offered the majority of the \ntestimony regarding the SOR debts. After completing credit counseling, she and Applicant \ninstituted a strict budget, and despite their tight finances, were able to maintain their \nongoing financial obligations without incurring any delinquencies. However, they did not \nhave the financial ability to address the debts from the repossessed vehicles. (Tr. 36-37.) \nAfter Applicant\u2019s retirement, he and his wife intended to move to another state and \npurchase a home using a VA loan. In September or October 2016 in anticipation of \napplying for the loan, Applicant\u2019s wife contacted the creditors of the two charged-off \nrepossession deficiencies in an effort to resolve the debts. (Tr. 24-32.) \n \n \nAfter multiple unsuccessful attempts, Applicant\u2019s wife was eventually able to \ncontact the two creditors and offer to enter repayment plans. She also attempted to settle \nSOR \u00b6 1.e with a lump-sum payment from money Applicant received as a payout for his \nunused leave when he retired. Applicant\u2019s wife was told by both creditors that the \ncontracts had been canceled and the debts charged-off, therefore, the creditors were \nunable to accept any form of repayment. She has since disputed both debts with the credit \nreporting agencies. She stated that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was removed from \nApplicant\u2019s credit report in May 2019 and SOR \u00b6 1.e was removed in July 2019. She has \nnot received a cancellation of debt notice from either creditor. (Tr. 27-29; Tr. 34-43; Tr. \n58.) \n \nIn March 2016, Applicant and his wife opened their first credit-card account since \ntheir 2010 bankruptcy discharge. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that they paid $500 for a \nsecured credit card, with a monthly fee of $25 and annual fee of $79. It was their practice \n\n \n \n4\nto use the card for gasoline, then pay the balance. Applicant\u2019s wife canceled the card \nonline and received confirmation that the account was closed. It is her recollection that \nthe account had a $0 balance when she closed it. However, the $512 charged-off debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is for this account. She contacted the creditor and requested an \naccounting, and offered to settle the account. She has not received any response from \nthe creditor. (GX 4; Tr. 29-32; Tr. 47-48.) \n \nApplicant and his wife moved to another state in August 2016. It was their intention \nfor Applicant to be fully retired and for them to live off of his pension of $2,530 per month \nand Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s income from part-time substitute teaching. They purchased their \nfirst house in November 2016. (Tr. 54-55.) \n \n \nThe $913 charged-off debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is for a credit card that Applicant \nand his wife opened in January 2017. They used the card to pay for replacing the water \npump in their new home. Shortly thereafter, Applicant\u2019s wife realized that the card had a \nvery high interest rate. She closed the account and canceled the card online. It is her \nrecollection that the account had a $0 balance when she closed it. She thinks it is possible \nthat there is a balance owed but disputes the charged-off amount. She contacted the \ncreditor and requested an accounting, and offered to settle the debt. She has not received \nany response from the creditor. (Tr. 41-45.) \n \nIn September 2017, Applicant and his wife sustained damage to their house from \nHurricane Irma. After their insurance company covered the loss, it canceled their plan. \nThey purchased a new plan and their annual insurance premium increased from $1,600 \nto $3,700. Their property taxes also increased.  The end result is that their mortgage \nincreased by approximately $500 per month. Additionally, when Applicant retired, he and \nhis wife lost their vision and dental insurance coverage, which increased their out-of-\npocket expenses. Further Applicant experienced health issues that required treatment \nand he had to pay a $3,000 deductible. In order to manage the additional financial \nobligations, and in order to avoid incurring any additional debt, Applicant returned to full-\ntime employment in February 2018. (Tr. 54-56.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife does not recognize the $650 credit-card account alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. Applicant\u2019s wife thinks this is probably their son\u2019s account. Applicant and his wife \nhave a son with the same name as Applicant and there have been other instances when \ntheir son\u2019s accounts have been attributed to Applicant. Applicant\u2019s wife has disputed this \naccount with the credit reporting agencies. (Tr. 29-32; Tr. 45-47.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife received a call from the creditor of the $164 medical debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.g. She initially thought the medical bill should have been covered by insurance \nso she contacted her insurance carrier and obtained an explanation of benefits. She \nconfirmed that she owed the $164, and paid it in January or February 2019. (Tr. 32.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife now works in a full-time permanent position as a substitute \nteacher. In addition to Applicant\u2019s pension, the couple brings home approximately $3,600 \na month. They are current with their mortgage and do not have any open credit-card \n\n \n \n5\naccounts. They have a checking account with approximately $700, a retirement account \nwith approximately $2,900 and Applicant\u2019s 401(k) has a balance of approximately \n$15,000. They have two vehicles that are paid off, one of which they bought with the \nmoney Applicant received as a payout for his unused leave when he retired. They \nmaintain a strict budget online through their bank and Applicant\u2019s wife monitors their \naccounts and credit score daily. They pay all of their ongoing financial obligations \nelectronically through automatic debits. They live within their means and maintain money \nfor use in the event of an emergency. They have not incurred any recent delinquent \naccounts. Applicant and his wife maintain their willingness and ability to resolve their \noutstanding accounts. (Tr. 49-54.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for a public trust position.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n6\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d).  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7\n \nApplicant\u2019s past financial problems are attributable to matters largely beyond his \ncontrol. Specifically, he did not get paid for four months in 2009, which pushed his already \nstrained finances, due in large measure to the costs of his disabled son\u2019s medical care \nand Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s inability to work outside the home, over the edge. Applicant acted \nresponsibly by filing bankruptcy and completing credit counseling.  \n \n \nFollowing the bankruptcy, Applicant and his wife needed to purchase a vehicle, \nand in doing so wanted to begin reestablishing their credit. They entered a purchase \nagreement in good faith but the creditor did not comply with the agreement. Applicant and \nhis wife acted responsibly by following their attorney\u2019s advice, and by honoring their \nbudget, when they surrendered the vehicle. Applicant and his wife then purchased a less-\nexpensive used vehicle, and were again victims of predatory lending practices. The \ncharged-off balances for the two voluntary repossessions constitute 92% of the SOR \ndebt. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e.) Applicant\u2019s wife contacted the creditors in a good-faith effort \nto resolve the accounts but they are closed and charged off. Applicant\u2019s wife paid the \n$164 medical debt and has disputed the other SOR debts. She has also requested \naccountings of the two credit-card debts and she and Applicant are willing and able to \nresolve these accounts.  \n \n \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \nAfter purchasing their first house, Applicant and his wife\u2019s financial obligations\nincreased. They demonstrated their financial responsibility by not incurring any new\ndelinquent debts and through Applicant\u2019s return to full-time employment. Applicant and\nhis wife live within their means and are current on their mortgage-loan payments and\nother financial obligations. They have a savings account and retirement accounts. They\nare both employed full time and Applicant receives a pension. They do not have any open\ncredit-card accounts. They completed credit counseling and have implemented sound\nfinancial practices, including adhering to a budget, paying their bills through automatic\ndebits, and maintain an emergency fund.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant and wife\u2019s past financial delinquencies were not due to frivolous or \nirresponsible spending. They have made a good-faith effort to repay or dispute their debts \nand have instituted a plan to maintain their financial stability. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (a), 20(b), 20(d), \nand 20(e) apply.  \n \n \n\n \n \n8\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the \nwhole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2, but have also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant served honorably in the U.S. Army for four years and worked as a \ncommunity correctional monitor for 26 years. While Applicant and his wife experienced \nfinancial difficulties that resulted in delinquent debts, they have taken proactive measures \nto ensure their ongoing financial stability.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the trustworthiness concerns raised by his financial circumstances. Accordingly, \nI conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant him eligibility for access to sensitive information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant. \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information \nis granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n08/20/2020 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant admitted to multiple falsifications on a November 2017 security \nclearance application (SCA) and to falsifying an earlier Government application form. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient information to mitigate the resulting personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. The cross-allegation under the financial considerations security \nconcern is not established. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 4, 2017. \nOn October 31 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline F, (financial considerations). The \nDOD CAF issued the SOR under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n\n \n2 \n \n \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 6, 2019 and elected to have his case \ndecided by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) on the administrative (written) record, in lieu of a hearing. On March 17, 2020, \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), \nincluding documents identified as Items 1 through 5. Applicant received the FORM on \nMay 27, 2020. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. After receiving an extension, Applicant submitted a \nresponse to the FORM on July 6, 2020, which I have marked as Item A. Applicant did not \nnote any objections to the Government\u2019s evidence. Department Counsel did not object to \nadmission of Item A. \n \nThe SOR and the answer (Items 1 and 2) are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 \nthrough 5 are admitted into evidence without objection, as is Item A. The case was \nassigned to me on July 28, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. He provided \nno explanations and provided no documents with his Answer. He did not answer the \ncross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.a, so I consider that he denied the allegation. His admissions \nare incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 23-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 2015, and then attended college for the next two years, until July 2017. He \ndid not earn a degree. (Items 2, 4) In his FORM response, he said he is again taking \ncollege classes in pursuit of his bachelor\u2019s degree. (Item A) \n \n \nFrom February 2015 to about May 2016, Applicant had a job working the night shift \nat a local supermarket. (Item 2 at 14) From May 2016 until March 2017, he worked as a \nwarehouse clerk on a U.S. Air Force base. (Item 2 at 13) Applicant left that position to \ntake his current job with a defense contractor. After a three-month trial period, Applicant \nwas hired for a permanent position in August 2017. (Items 2, 4)  \n \n \nIn connection with the earlier job on the Air Force base, Applicant submitted a \ndeclaration for federal employment (DFE) in May 2016. (Item 3) In connection with his \ncurrent job with the defense contractor, he submitted an SCA in November 2017. (Item \n2) The personal conduct allegations largely concern Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose certain \nnegative information on those documents.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b concern Applicant\u2019s disclosures on his DFE and SCA, \nrespectively, about his departure from the supermarket job. Applicant explained during \nhis security clearance background interview that he was fired from the job after failing to \n\n \n3 \n \n \nappear for work one day. On his DFE, he did not report the termination, and on his SCA, \nhe did not give a fully candid explanation of what happened.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 2016 DFE (Item 3) included the following question (quoted in \npertinent part):  \n \n12. During the last 5 years, have you been fired from a job for any reason; \ndid you quit after being told that you would be fired; did you leave any job \nby mutual agreement because of specific problems . . .  \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d In answering the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a, which alleged \nthat he falsified this answer.  \n \nApplicant reported the supermarket job on his SCA. He explained the \ncircumstances in two places. First, he reported that \u201cI quit because I received a better job \nopportunity up on [the Air Force base.]\u201d (Item 2 at 14) On the same page, he checked \n\u201cYes\u201d in answer to the question asking him to report if he was fired, quit after being told \nhe would be fired, or left by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct or \nunsatisfactory performance. (Item 2 at 14) He then noted that he had \u201cQuit [the] job after \nbeing told you would be fired.\u201d He explained that \u201c[t]here was a miscommunication with \nmy available PTO.\u201d (Item 2 at 15) (I interpret the phrase \u201cPTO\u201d here as meaning \u201cPersonal \nTime Off.\u201d  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged that this answer was false, in that he reported that he quit after \nbeing told he would be fired, when in fact he was fired \u201cfor violation of [his] employer\u2019s \nattendance policy.\u201d (Item 1) Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.b in his Answer.  \n \nThe first line of the interview summary notes that the interview \u201cwas conducted to \ndiscuss employment misconduct at [the supermarket.]\u201d (Item 4 at 1) Applicant explained \nto the interviewing agent that he asked his team lead at the supermarket if he could take \na day off. He said, \u201c[s]he approved the absence so [Applicant] did not go to work that \nday.\u201d When Applicant reported to work the next day, he was called into the office and told \nthat his absence the day before was treated as a \u201cno-call, no-show,\u201d and he was \nterminated. Applicant said he attempted to explain to human resources that his team lead \nhad approved his absence, but he was taken to his locker and escorted off the property. \n(Item 4 at 2) In responding to the FORM, Applicant said he had taken a couple of days \noff and called in on the day he was supposed to return to work. (Item A) \n \nAccording to the interview summary, Applicant acknowledged to the interviewer \nthat he had, in fact, been fired from his position at the supermarket. He acknowledged to \nthe interviewer that he was afraid the termination could affect his chances of a better job \nand his security clearance. He \u201cadmitted that he intentionally falsified this information in \nan attempt to make his termination appear more favorable.\u201d He also noted that he was \nembarrassed by the matter. (Item 4 at 2)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant also revealed during his background interview that he tried marijuana in \nJanuary 2016 while at a gathering at a friend\u2019s house. He took a single puff from a \nmarijuana cigarette and began choking and coughing. He did not try marijuana any other \ntime, and does not intend to use it or any other illegal drug in the future. (Item 4 at 2-3; \nItem A) \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose this single instance of marijuana use on his November \n2017 SCA, in answer to a question asking, \u201c[i]n the last seven (7) years, have you illegally \nused drugs or controlled substances?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and thereby failed to \ndisclose his single use of marijuana. (Item 2 at 29) Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.c, which \nalleged that he deliberately falsified his answer.  \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged to the interviewing agent that he intentionally failed to \ndisclose his marijuana use on his application because he did not want it to affect his \nfuture. He noted his regret for failing to list it on his application, and said he wanted to go \nback and change his answer before his interview but was not able to. (Item 4 at 3) \n \n \nIn his FORM Response, Applicant acknowledged the falsification and said, \u201cI \nwasn\u2019t aware of how serious this was and I\u2019m fully aware now that it\u2019s much better to be \nhonest and upfront from the beginning.\u201d (Item A) \n \n \nIn 2017, Applicant purchased a car. When he registered the vehicle with the state, \nhe falsified the purchase price in order to avoid paying sales tax on the vehicle. This is \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, which Applicant admitted. \n \nApplicant\u2019s November 2017 SCA (Item 2 at 31) included the following financial \nquestion:  \n \nTaxes: In the last seven (7) years, have you failed to file or pay Federal, \nstate, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance?  \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d In answering the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6 1.d, which \nalleged in part, that he falsified this answer in failing to disclose that he failed to pay the \nstate tax on the car. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) (The text of SOR \u00b6 1.d also alleges that Applicant \u201cfailed \nto disclose\u201d that he \u201cfalsified the sale price\u201d of the car in order to avoid paying sales tax \non the car; and that this activity was discovered, resulting in the $1,787 tax lien issued \nagainst Applicant by the state. This portion of the allegation alleges a \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d \ninformation that goes beyond the text of the question at issue, which merely asks if \napplicant has failed to pay taxes when required.) \n \n \nIn responding to the FORM, Applicant acknowledged that \u201c[i]n 2017 I had lied \nabout the price of the vehicle I had just recently purchased to get out of paying the full \namount of taxes that I was originally supposed to pay. I knew that I had done that and still \ndecided to answer \u2018no.\u2019\u201d (Item A) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s November 2017 credit report reflects that the resulting tax lien was \nissued in November 2017 (the same month as the credit report and the same month \nApplicant prepared his SCA). (Item 5 at 2; Item 2 at 1) Other than this reference, there is \nnothing in the record to document SOR \u00b6 1.e, concerning Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose \nthe full sales tax of the car when he registered it.  \n \nApplicant began making $100 payments towards the tax lien in October 2018, and \nnoted in his background interview that he intended to have the debt paid off by April 2019. \n(Item 4 at 2) (The $1,787 tax lien itself is not alleged under Guideline F, though Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to report the sales tax when he registered the car is alleged as part of SOR \u00b6 2.a).  \n \n \nIn responding to the FORM, Applicant apologized for his lack of honesty on his \nSCA, calling it \u201cdumb and unprofessional.\u201d He wants to stay at his current employer for \nthe rest of his career. Applicant openly admitted falsifying his responses and expressed \nregret for having done so. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \u201cthe \nclearly consistent standard indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n\n \n6 \n \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty \nor rule violations.  \n \n \nApplicant was fired from the supermarket job in about May or June 2016, after he \nfailed to appear for work one day. Though he attempted to dispute the matter with the \nsupermarket\u2019s HR department at the time, he knew he had been fired. Shortly thereafter, \nhe prepared a DFE in connection with his next job, on the Air Force base. He failed to \ndisclose his termination on that form in response to a direct question that asked for its \ndisclosure. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a, since the DFE is a form \u201cused to determine \nemployment qualifications.\u201d  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nIn November 2017, Applicant submitted an SCA in connection with his current job. \nThis time, he reported the termination, but reported that he had \u201cquit [the] job after being \ntold [he] would be fired.\u201d This, too, was a falsification, as Applicant admitted during his \nbackground interview that he knew he had been fired, yet still underreported what had \nhappened because he feared it might impact his eligibility for a clearance. AG \u00b6 16(a) \napplies to SOR \u00b6 1.b.  \n \n \nApplicant also deliberately failed to disclose his single use of marijuana on his \nSCA, which he acknowledged withholding for the same reason. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to \nSOR \u00b6 1.c.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant purchased a car at some point in 2017, he deliberately falsified \nthe registration paperwork by underreporting (or failing to report) the sales tax owed. This \nwas an act of questionable judgment, lack of candor, and dishonesty, under the general \npersonal conduct security concern set forth in AG \u00b6 15. When combined with the \nestablished instances of falsification (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e), AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) is also \nestablished as a pattern of dishonesty.  \n \nApplicant also failed to disclose on his SCA that he had failed to pay the required \nsales tax on the car, in answer to the question, \u201c[i]n the last seven (7) years, have you \nfailed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance?\u201d He \nacknowledged that his answer to this question, too, was false. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \n\u00b6 1.e. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth the applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n   \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant made prompt good-faith efforts to \ncorrect his multiple deliberate omissions before being confronted about them in his \nbackground interview. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions constitute a series of instances of poor judgment and lack of \ncandor. He deliberately failed to fully disclose information about a recent job termination, \na recent instance of marijuana use, and a recent deliberate underreporting of a sales tax \n\n \n8 \n \n \nobligation. Only one of these instances (the under-reporting of the sales tax obligation) \nwas alleged as an independent security concern. Applicant\u2019s false statements about \nthose instances, however, were repeated and multiple. As a result, AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and (d) \ndo not fully apply, though Applicant admitted his behavior, expressed his regret, indicated \nhe has learned from his mistakes and indicated he will not repeat them.  \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation.1 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; and \n \n(g) . . . failure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as required. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges, as a separate financial considerations security concern, \n\u201cThat information set forth in subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e, above.\u201d Both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and \n1.e cite, and relate to, Applicant\u2019s falsification of the state registration documents by \nunderreporting (or failing to report) the true sales tax on his newly purchased vehicle.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, however, alleges Applicant\u2019s falsification about that act on his SCA \u2013 \nnot the act itself. Falsification of an SCA, even falsification of an answer to a financial \n                                                          \n1 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n\n \n9 \n \n \nquestion on an SCA, is a personal conduct security concern, and not a financial one. It is \nmore properly, and in this case was, alleged under Guideline E. No Guideline F \ndisqualifying conditions apply to SOR \u00b6 1.d, as cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a.  \n \nThis leaves SOR \u00b6 1.e, as cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. In the Government\u2019s FORM, \nDepartment Counsel cites AG \u00b6 19(d) as applicable, but does not explain why. I conclude \nthat Applicant\u2019s falsification of vehicle registration documents in order to avoid paying \nsales tax on his newly purchased vehicle, while a deliberate attempt to avoid paying sales \ntax, does not constitute an \u201cintentional financial breach of trust\u201d like those acts listed in \nAG \u00b6 19(d) or otherwise contemplated by it.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(g) might otherwise be potentially applicable, but the text of the \ndisqualifying condition addressed only income tax, not sales tax. Thus, AG \u00b6 19(g) does \nnot technically apply. Lastly, the fact of the debt itself (the unpaid $1,787 state sales tax, \nwhich led to a state tax lien), is not alleged under Guideline F. Thus, regardless of the \nsize of the debt, which here is relatively small, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) do not apply.  \n \n \nSince no disqualifying conditions under Guideline F apply, I need not address \napplicability of any mitigating conditions, under AG \u00b6 20. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E and F in my \nwhole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant made several false statements on his security clearance application and \nmade a false statement on an earlier government form in an effort to paint himself in a \nbetter light. He acknowledged what he did and regrets his actions. But, the fact that this \n\n \n10 \n \n \ncase involves multiple falsifications and instances of poor judgment is difficult to \novercome. I also did not have the opportunity to assess Applicant\u2019s demeanor and weigh \nhis credibility since this case is decided on the written record. Applicant is a young man, \nwho now perhaps has a better understanding of the need to be fully candid with the \nGovernment in the security clearance application process. However he needs more \nmaturity and growth before he can establish himself as a stronger candidate for eligibility \nfor access to classified information. He has failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude that while financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not established, Applicant did not provide sufficient \ninformation to mitigate personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/07/2020 \nDecision \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s illegal drug involvement. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 24, 2018, \nseeking to continue a clearance he has held since 2004. On June 20, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse) and B (Foreign Influence). The DOD CAF acted \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on September \n1, 2006. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 16, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \n\n \n2 \n \ncase on December 4, 2019, and withdrew the Guideline B allegations. On the same day, \na complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was \ngiven an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate \nthe Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on December 14, 2019, and timely \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on January 29, 2020.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nThe SOR originally alleged security concerns under Guideline B. It alleged that \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen and resident of Uzbekistan (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and his step-daughter \nand step-son-in-law are citizens of Russia (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant refuted SOR \u00b6 2.b in \nhis answer to the SOR by producing evidence that his step-daughter and step-son-in-law \nare Canadian citizens. He asserted in his answer to the SOR that his wife intended to live \nin the United States and had applied for a visa. \n \n \nIn Department Counsel\u2019s submission of the case, she stated, \u201cThe Government is \nnot moving toward with the Guideline B allegations at this time, and is only moving forward \nwith the Guideline H allegation.\u201d This statement is somewhat ambiguous. I have \nconstrued it to mean that Department Counsel withdrew the Guideline B allegations in \naccordance with Directive \u00b6 E3.1.6. Her statement also could be construed to mean only \nthat she did not intend to submit evidence regarding the Guideline B allegations. \nHowever, holding allegations in abeyance after the case has been submitted for a \ndecision is not an option under the Directive. Having concluded that Department Counsel \nintended to withdraw the Guideline B allegations, I have made no findings regarding them. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a and \ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.b. His admissions are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 66-year-old software developer employed by a federal contractor \nsince August 2011. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1975. He worked for other federal \ncontractors from February to October 2001, July 2006 to February 2008, and from March \n2011 until he began his current job. According to his SCA, he has held a security \nclearance since about 2004. (FORM Item 4 at 48.) \n \nApplicant married in January 1981, divorced in February 2012, and married in \nDecember 2017. He has two sons from his first marriage, ages 32 and 29.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in January 2018, he did not disclose any use \nof illegal substances. In an affidavit provided to a security investigator in May 2018, he \ndisclosed that he used a substance he believed was marijuana as well as liquid forms of \ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) from February 2015 to November \n2017. At the time, he lived in a state where the substances were legal. He stopped using \n\n \n3 \n \nthem when he moved to another state were the substances were illegal. Both THC and \nCBD are extracts of marijuana and are prohibited substances under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq.  \n \nApplicant used the illegal substances every one or two weeks. He used the \nsubstances for pain relief, because he was grossly overweight but was unable to exercise \ndue to severe knee pain. He told the security investigator that he used the illegal \nsubstances because he felt that his health was more important than the rules for holding \na security clearance. He also told the investigator that he did not intend to continue to use \nthe illegal substances because they were illegal in his state of residence and he no longer \nsuffered from knee pain.  \n \nApplicant told the security investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use \nin his SCA, because he was worried that it might jeopardize his security clearance. \n(FORM Item 5 at 2.) His failure to disclose his drug involvement in his SCA is not alleged \nin the SOR. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \n\n \n4 \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from \napproximately February 2015 to at least November 2017, while granted access to \nclassified information. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish three disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s use of illegal substances was frequent \nand did not occur under unusual circumstances. He stopped using them in November \n2017, when he moved to a state where they were illegal and no longer suffered from knee \npain. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the \nevidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform \nor rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant chose to conceal his illegal drug use, knowing that disclosing it would \njeopardize his security clearance. His intentional concealment of his drug use in his SCA \n\n \n6 \n \nwas not alleged in the SOR. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered \nto assess an applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline \nis applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; \nto consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part \nof a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I \nhave considered his falsification of his SCA for these limited purposes.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s attitude toward illegal drug use, as expressed in his interview by a \nsecurity investigator, and his intentional failure to disclose his drug use in his SCA are \ninconsistent with \u201csuccessful rehabilitation.\u201d When faced with a painful knee condition, he \ndecided that remedying his pain was more important than following the rules about drug \nuse. There is no evidence in the record that he tried other lawful means of dealing with \nhis knee pain before resorting to illegal drugs. His attitude about his drug use and his lack \nof candor in his SCA leave me with serious doubts about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is partially established. Applicant has abstained from illegal drugs since \nNovember 2017, but he has not signed the statement of intent required to establish AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(3). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his use of illegal drugs. \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

DOD acted under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \nApplicant answered (Ans.) the SOR on August 22, 2019, and requested an \nadministrative determination. On October 21, 2019, Department Counsel requested that \nthis case be converted into a hearing case before an administrative judge. The case \nwas assigned to me on November 6, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 21, 2019, and the hearing \nwas convened as scheduled on December 17, 2019. The Government offered exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The \n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified, \ncalled one witness, and offered one exhibit (AE A), which was admitted without \nobjection. The record remained open until January 10, 2020, and Applicant submitted \nAE B-C, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on December 30, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations. His admissions are \nincorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for \nthis employer for approximately two years. He is a high school graduate and has \ncompleted two years of college. He has been married for 39 years. He has three adult \nchildren. He served on active duty in the Air Force from 1982 to 1987 and was \nhonorably discharged. (Tr. 6, 16-18; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his federal tax returns for tax years \n2010, 2011, and 2012, and that he owes the IRS for unpaid taxes in the approximate \namount of $24,712 for tax years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h). \nThe allegations are supported by admissions in his trustworthiness application, his \nanswers to interrogatives, his federal tax transcripts from 2010 to 2017, and admissions \nin his SOR answer. (GE 1-3; Ans.)  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his tax problems to the time when he owned his own \nbusiness. He testified that he owned and operated an auto body repair business from \n2006 or 2007 until 2009 when he reported on his trustworthiness application (TA) and in \nJanuary 2018, during his background interview (BI) that his business operated from \nApril 2009 to February 2011. When he owned his business, he claimed that he hired an \naccountant to prepare his taxes. He did not remember the name of the accountant. He \nclaims he provided the accountant the necessary documents to file his tax returns and \nalso gave him money to pay the taxes. Applicant believes that the accountant \nabsconded with the funds. He went to the accountant\u2019s office in 2010 and found it empty \nwith the telephone disconnected. His 2010 federal tax return was not filed by the \naccountant. He knows he owes on his federal taxes, but he does not know the amount. \n(Tr. 19-20, 23-24; GE 1-2) \n \n \nAfter Applicant closed his business in 2011, he worked as a truck driver for \nvarious companies until beginning his current employment in November 2017. Applicant \ndoes not know why he did not timely file his 2011 and 2012 federal returns. In October \n2018, Applicant hired an accountant who is a licensed IRS enrolled agent (Agent) to \nresolve his tax issues. The Agent testified that Applicant owed the IRS approximately \n$176,000 for unpaid back federal taxes. He further testified that 90 percent of the tax \ndebt was attributed to Applicant\u2019s business in 2009. The Agent filed Applicant\u2019s federal \nreturns for years 2010 through 2012 sometime in 2019 (IRS tax transcripts for years \n2010 and 2011 indicate that as of June 2019, no returns were filed. The transcript for \n\n \n3 \n \nyear 2012 indicates the return was filed in February 2019). Tax transcripts for years \n2013-2017 show that Applicant owes unpaid taxes for each of those years. The Agent \ntestified that all Applicant\u2019s federal returns have now been filed. (Tr. 23, 28, 30-31, 33-\n36, 38; GE 3) \n \n \nThe Agent testified that he has been negotiating with the IRS since December \n2018, to reach an offer-in-compromise to enable Applicant to begin paying his tax debt. \nThe current offer would reduce Applicant\u2019s tax debt to approximately $25,000. This \namount could be paid over 24 months. Applicant submitted a post-hearing document \nshowing that the IRS agreed to further reduce the offer-in-compromise amount to \n$10,486. Applicant and his wife agreed to the new terms on January 8, 2020. The \npayment terms were as follows: $152 already paid; $1,944 payable with the sending of \nthe signed offer-in-compromise addendum form (no payment documentation was \nprovided); $1,677 due one month after acceptance of the addendum; $6,711 due five \nmonths after acceptance of the addendum. Applicant currently lives paycheck to \npaycheck and is having his wages garnished to pay for delinquent student loans. If \nApplicant misses a payment under the offer-in-compromise, the agreement can be \nvoided. (Tr. 38-41, 45; AE A-B; Ans.) \n \n \nApplicant offered five personal reference letters from coworkers, supervisors, and \npersonal friends. His coworkers and supervisors described him as highly professional, a \nstrong team leader, and trustworthy. His personal references noted his loyalty, \ndedication, helpfulness, and trustworthiness. (AE C) \n \n \nOther than seeking assistance with his tax problem, Applicant has not sought \nfinancial counseling and did not present evidence of a budget. (Tr. 29) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the trustworthiness concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \ntrustworthiness concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for years 2010-2012 until \nsometime in 2019. He owes federal taxes for years 2013-2017, which have not been \npaid. I find all disqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent, multiple, and cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. His 2010-2012 federal tax returns were recently \nfiled in 2019. He did not pay his taxes owed for years 2013-2017. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable. Although Applicant\u2019s accountant\u2019s negligence or criminal actions in 2009 or \n2010, may have contributed to his delayed tax return filing in 2010, they do not justify \nhis delayed return filings for 2011 and 2012. They also do not justify his failure to pay \nhis taxes owed for years 2013-2017. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \n \nOther than his hiring of a tax professional in October 2018, there is no evidence \nof financial counseling. Applicant recently filed all of his required federal tax returns and \nhas an offer-in-compromise agreement pending with the IRS, but no proof of payment \nunder the offer is in the record, only a promise to do so. While there are some indicators \nshowing that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control, it is too early to say \nwhether those indicators will endure. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. His delayed \nresponse to dealing with both his tax-filing problem and his delinquent taxes \ndemonstrates something less than a good-faith effort to resolve his tax issues. AG \u00b6 \n\n \n6 \n \n20(d) does not fully apply. Through the efforts of his Agent, he was able to negotiate a \nreduction in his overall tax liability from approximately $176,000 to approximately \n$10,400. However, he has not shown any payment under this compromise plan and he \nis admittedly living paycheck to paycheck. A promise to pay is not equivalent to an \nestablished track record of payment. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not fully apply because although \nhis returns have now been filed, they were filed late and he has yet to make any \npayments under the negotiated offer-in-compromise.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information must be an overall commonsense assessment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered the circumstances by which Applicant\u2019s taxes became an issue. I \nalso considered his military service and the recommendations from his coworkers and \nfriends. However, Applicant\u2019s actions to resolve his tax issues can be characterized as, \ntoo little too late. He has not established a meaningful track record of financial \nresponsibility, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his taxes.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information.

He did not mitigate his recent and lengthy history of criminal \nconduct and marijuana use. He did not mitigate the security concerns related to \nfinancial considerations, drug involvement, or criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 4, 2017. On \nApril 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (financial considerations), Guideline H (drug involvement), and \nGuideline J (criminal conduct). The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security \n\n \n2 \n \n \nExecutive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \neffective June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 13, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on December 12, 2019. On January 16, 2020, DOHA issued \na notice scheduling the hearing for February 5, 2020.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which I admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified, but offered no other evidence. I held the record open to provide him the \nopportunity to do so, but he did not provide any post-hearing submissions. The record \nclosed on February 19, 2020. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) the same day.  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 2.a, 3.a, 3.b, and 3.d-3.g, although he said \nthat SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.e and 3.f were the same offense. He denied SOR \u00b6 3.c. His admissions \nare incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has never \nmarried. He has an adult son who lives in another state, an 18-year-old daughter, a 15-\nyear-old daughter, and a 14-year-old daughter. His three daughters live with their \nmothers. Two of them live in other states. Applicant lives with his girlfriend and her 10-\nyear-old son. (GE 1; Tr. 25) Applicant earned a certification in 1997, an associate\u2019s \ndegree in 2012, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. (GE 1) He testified that he also has a \nmaster\u2019s degree. (Tr. 25, 58) \n \nApplicant was employed by an electronics company from December 2005 to \nJanuary 2008. He left the job to take a position in another state, but the job did not \nmaterialize. He was then unemployed for most of the next four and a half years. He \nspent much of this time improving his education. (GE 1; Tr. 67-69) He was employed at \na computer company from May to September 2013, but was terminated after a \nconfrontation with a coworker. (GE 1; Tr. 68-70 He was then unemployed again until \nMay 2014, when he briefly took a job caring for seniors. He left the position because he \ndid not believe the employer was following regulations appropriately. (GE 1; Tr. 71-72)  \n \nSince 2017, Applicant has worked in information technology for his current \nemployer and clearance sponsor. (GE 1, Tr. 72-76) On occasion, he was unemployed \nbetween contracts. (GE 1; Tr. 61-65) He has never held a clearance. (Tr. 13) Applicant \ntestified that in 2019, he earned between $35,000 and $40,000. He works full time. (Tr. \n65-67, 90-93) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn April 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony injury to a child. He \nwas convicted and served five years in jail. (SOR \u00b6 3.g)(GE 1 at 43-44) Applicant \ntestified that the injuries to the child included bruises and a burn mark. (Tr. 34-35)  \n \nIn September 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with third-degree \nlarceny. (SOR \u00b6 3.f) He explained that he was arrested after he attempted to steal some \nitems of clothing from a department store. He received a period of probation, but failed \nto pay the related fine. In March 2003, he was in an auto accident. In the aftermath, he \ngave a false name to the police. He was arrested for making a false report and for the \nlarceny charge, due to the unpaid fine. He said that his probation was extended as a \nresult. (GE 1 at 44-45; GE 5 at 11; Tr. 26-28, 35-37) (SOR \u00b6 3.e) \n \nIn 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of \nalcohol (DUI) and driving with a suspended license. He was convicted and sentenced to \none day in jail, 12 months of probation, fined, ordered to perform community service, \nand attend DUI education. (SOR \u00b6 3.d) (GE 1 at 45-46; GE 5 at 8-9) \n \nIn January 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony child abuse. \n(SOR \u00b6 3.c) (GE 5 at 12; GE 1 at 38) He denied SOR \u00b6 3.c. Applicant testified that the \ngirlfriend of his daughter\u2019s maternal grandfather filed a child-abuse complaint against \nApplicant. The complainant, he asserted, was herself wanted for murder at the time. \nApplicant was arrested, as was his daughter\u2019s mother. Applicant denied that he \ncommitted the offense. (Tr. 28-31, 37) He participated in parenting classes. (Tr. 34, 81-\n83) He reported the arrest on his SCA and noted that the charge was dismissed in \nSeptember 2014. (GE 1 at 38-39) The arrest is documented in Applicant\u2019s criminal \nrecord, but disposition of the charge is not. (GE 5) \n \nIn about June 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication \nand resisting arrest, and cited for speeding and improper lane usage. (SOR \u00b6 3.b) In \nOctober 2013, he pleaded guilty to speeding and public intoxication and was fined. The \nresisting arrest charge and the citation for improper lane usage were dismissed. \nApplicant testified that he was on his way home and a police car going in the opposite \ndirection turned and followed him. He pulled into his apartment complex. When the \npolice asked him to exit the vehicle, he tripped over a curb and fell down because the \nparking lot was not well lit. (Tr. 37-38) (Answer to SOR; GE 1 at 39-40; Tr. 31-32) The \ncharges are not detailed on the exhibit documenting Applicant\u2019s criminal record. (GE 5) \n \nIn December 2014, Applicant was charged with DUI and also cited for speeding \nand improper lane usage. (SOR \u00b6 3.a) Applicant admitted the fact that he was charged \nbut denied the conduct. He testified that he was pulled over because the police officer \nobserved him swerving between the lanes and smelled liquor on him during the traffic \nstop. Applicant denied that he consumed alcohol that night. He said had just left the \nhouse, and was \u201csleepy\u201d but not drunk. (Tr. 83-85) In October 2016, the DUI charge \nwas nolle prossed after Applicant attended a nine-month DUI class through a diversion \nprogram. (GE 5 at 12; GE 1 at 41-42; Tr. 31-32, 39-40, 76-80, 94) He has not had any \nsubsequent arrests. (Tr. 40) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant reported on his SCA that he used marijuana weekly, at times daily, \nbetween May 2003 and July 2016. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) His most recent use was after the \nsudden death of a close friend. He said this was shortly before he participated in the \nDUI diversion program. The timing of his last marijuana use is unclear. Applicant said \nhe had not used marijuana since July 2016. (Tr. 43, 44) He later said this was some \ntime in 2017. (Tr. 44, 46-47) He denied using marijuana after submitting his May 2017 \nSCA. (Tr. 46) He acknowledged knowing that marijuana use is against state and federal \nlaw. He has attended Narcotics Anonymous (NA) a few times in the last three years. \n(Tr. 40-47, 94-98)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation also included credit reports from July 2017, \nMay 2018, and March 2019. Applicant had five delinquent accounts, the largest by far \nbeing SOR \u00b6 1.a, concerning a $121,692 child support arrearage. SOR \u00b6 1.b is a \ncharged-off student loan account for $8,293. SOR \u00b6 1.c is another charged-off account \nfor $1,755. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($250) and 1.e ($76) are two past-due medical accounts. \nApplicant disclosed his debts on his SCA. (GE 1) \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant testified that he fell behind on his child-support \npayments during his periods of unemployment. This began with a layoff in 2009. He \nalso acknowledged working odd jobs, but said that none of that income went to arrears \nor child support. (Tr. 85-90) Applicant testified that his child support went into arrears in \nabout 2012. (Tr. 100) \n \nApplicant testified that he is currently paying on his child support and has money \ntaken out of his paycheck regularly. He said the arrearage amount was incurred during \nhis various periods of unemployment. The child support concerns his two younger \nchildren, one of whom lives in his home state and one of whom is in another state. \nApplicant said he is paying between $500 and $600 in child support monthly for one \nchild, and about $425 for another child. Applicant does not believe that his monthly \npayments address the amount in arrears. Applicant did not provide documentation of \nthe current status of his child-support payments. (Tr. 47-54, 99-104) \n \nApplicant asserted that his student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b) is in deferment. He said he \nhas other student loans, which are also deferred. (Tr. 54-55, 58-61) Applicant did not \nprovide documentation of the current status of his past-due student loan. The past-due \ndebt at SOR \u00b6 1.c is also unresolved. (Tr. 105) \n \nApplicant asserted that the two medical debts alleged (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e) are \nco-payments from medical procedures. He believes they should have been covered by \ninsurance. (Tr. 55-56) They remain unresolved.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 details the security concern for drug involvement: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following is potentially applicable: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above \ndefinition).\u201d Applicant used marijuana on a weekly, at times daily, basis between May \n2003 and at least July 2016, as alleged. AG \u00b6 25(a) is satisfied.  \n \n \nThe timing of Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana is unclear. He testified that his last \nuse occurred after the sudden death of a close friend. At times he testified that his last \nuse was in 2016; at other times, he testified his last use was in 2017. Applicant reported \non his SCA that he used marijuana as recently as July 2016 (as alleged). He testified \nthat he did not use marijuana on probation. He testified that he last used marijuana \nshortly before entering the diversion program after his 2014 DUI. That charge was nolle \nprossed in October 2016, and he said the diversion program lasted about nine months. \nEven if Applicant did not use marijuana in 2017, his 2016 use was likely during the \ndiversion program, or, at the least, while his DUI case was pending.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all  drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on a weekly, even daily basis for about thirteen years, \nas recently as July 2016. He asserted that he did not use marijuana during his periods \nof probation. Even if this were established, his periods of probation served only as gaps \nbetween the times when he was using marijuana. Given the extent of his marijuana \ninvolvement, which encompasses many years and which ended only recently, Applicant \ndid not establish a pattern of abstinence or a likelihood that his marijuana use will not \nrecur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and (b) do not apply.  \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 details the security concern for criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \n \nApplicant was convicted on a felony child-abuse charge in 1994 and served five \nyears in jail. He was arrested for larceny in 2001. He received probation but failed to \npay the fine, so he was arrested again in 2003. At that time, he gave a false name to the \npolice. Applicant was arrested for DUI in 2006. In 2012, he was arrested for public \nintoxication and resisting arrest. In 2014, he was arrested on another DUI charge. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (b) apply to those offenses.  \n \n \nApplicant was also arrested in 2012 on a felony child-abuse charge. (SOR \u00b6 3.c) \nHe denied SOR \u00b6 3.c but reported the arrest on his SCA. The arrest is also established \nby GE 5, his criminal record. The arrest is a matter of official record, which is sufficient \nto satisfy AG \u00b6 31(b).  \n \n \nThe citations for driving on a suspended license (2006), and for speeding and \nimproper lane usage (2012 and 2014) are not established as criminal conduct. Rather, \nthey are likely traffic infractions. Thus, no disqualifying conditions under Guideline J \napply to them.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nIn answering SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.e and 3.f, Applicant asserted that the two allegations \nwere the same. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same \nguideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2005). Applicant was arrested in \n2001 for larceny (SOR \u00b6 3.f). He failed to pay a related fine so he was arrested in 2003 \non the same charge. (SOR \u00b6 3.e) As to the larceny charge, they are duplicative, as the \ntwo allegations concern the same conduct. However, SOR \u00b6 3.e also concerns an \nunrelated charge of making a false report to the police. Thus, SOR \u00b6 3.e is not entirely \nduplicative of SOR \u00b6 3.f, and cannot be found in Applicant\u2019s favor on that basis.  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions:    \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;   \n \n(c) no reliable information that Applicant committed the offense; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \n \nAs to the 2012 felony child-abuse charge at SOR \u00b6 3.c, Applicant does not \ndispute that he was arrested, but he denies the conduct. GE 5, Applicant\u2019s criminal \nrecord documents the arrest, but no disposition is noted. The police report is not in the \nrecord, so there is no record evidence of the underlying basis for the arrest. Applicant \nreported on his SCA that the charge was dismissed in 2014. His prior record includes a \n1994 conviction for the same conduct, followed by a five-year jail term. Given that fact, \nthe lack of a documented disposition of the 2012 charge suggests that it was not \nestablished. AG \u00b6 32(c) applies to SOR \u00b6 3.c.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most serious offense, his 1994 arrest and subsequent conviction for \nfelony child abuse, led to a five-year jail term. Since then, he has been arrested many \ntimes, from 2001 to as recently as 2014. He also illegally used marijuana for many \nyears, including as recently as 2017. All of his marijuana use occurred after his felony \nprison term. While Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is not alleged as additional criminal \nconduct, it nonetheless serves to undercut a finding that Applicant is fully rehabilitated, \nor that he has established sufficient compliance with rules, regulations, and the law. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal record is simply too long, too serious, and too recent to warrant a \nfinding that his criminal conduct is mitigated. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) do not apply.  \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant has over $120,000 in child-support arrears, and just over $10,000 in \nother delinquencies. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n\n \n10 \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nNone of these mitigating conditions \nfully apply. Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies are ongoing and unresolved. They may be attributable, in part, to his \nvarious periods of unemployment, but Applicant did not establish that his debts are \nlargely due to that circumstance, or are largely due to other conditions beyond his \ncontrol. Applicant indicated, but did not document, that he has been making payments \non his child-support debts. He also did not establish that, even if his current child-\nsupport obligations are being addressed, that he is also addressing his extensive past-\ndue child-support responsibilities alleged in the SOR. He did not establish that whatever \nconditions led to his financial problems are in the past and are unlikely to recur. He did \nnot establish that he has made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20 (b), and 20(d) do not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, H, and J in my whole-person analysis. Applicant is credited with improving \nhis education and with trying to make a better life for himself after serving several years \nin jail. However, his debts are too great, his criminal record is too extensive, and his \nmarijuana use is too long-term and too recent for him to establish sufficient evidence \nthat he warrants eligibility for access to classified information. Overall, the record \n\n \n11 \n \n \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2: Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.d-3.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed 12 delinquent or past-due debts totaling $147,968 (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.l). In response, Applicant admitted with explanation SOR 1.a, and he denied with explanations SOR 1.b \u2013 1.l. Under Guideline K, the Government alleged that Applicant failed to properly perform his oversight duties as an information systems security officer (ISSO) (SOR 2.a); that in 2016 and 2017, he falsified records to show that he had performed required audits of classified information systems when he knew he had not done so (SOR 2.b); that in February 2016, Applicant violated security procedures by leaving a computer hard drive unsecured (SOR 2.c); that 3 in May and December 2016, he failed to follow required security procedures related to his personal travel abroad (SOR 2.d); and that in January 2017, he violated security procedures by failing to properly secure a classified area and container (SOR 2.e).

Billett, Esq. \n \n06/16/2020 \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge: \n \n \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns about his finances; however, security \nconcerns raised by multiple security violations at a previous employer remain unresolved. \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n \nOn June 19, 2014, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain or renew eligibility for a security clearance \nrequired for his employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, Applicant was subsequently awarded a top secret security \nclearance with eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI). A \nreinvestigation of his eligibility for a security clearance was initiated after response to \nreports of adverse information were entered in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n(JPAS) beginning in January 2017. Those reports concerned security violations by \nApplicant in 2016 and 2017, as well as his financial problems at that time. Based on the \nresults of that reinvestigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \ndetermine, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and \nby DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2, that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security clearance. \n \n \nOn May 24, 2019, DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guidelines for financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F) and handling protected information (Guideline K). The \nguidelines cited in the SOR were part of the current set of adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nissued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for \nall adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I \nreceived the case on November 25, 2019 and convened the requested hearing on \nJanuary 28, 2020. The parties appeared as scheduled. DOHA received a transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on February 10, 2020. With his Answer, Applicant included documents in \nsupport thereof. Without objection, they remained attached to the Answer and were \nadmitted as evidence. Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 10. \nApplicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 R. All exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection.  \n \n \nI held the record open after the hearing to allow Applicant to submit additional \ninformation. On February 14, 2020, Applicant submitted AX S and T, to which Department \nCounsel did not object. Additionally, due to time constraints on the day of hearing, I \ndirected the parties to submit their closing arguments in writing. Included in this record \nare Hearing Exhibit (HX) 1 (Index of Government Exhibits and Index of Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits), HX 2 (Department Counsel\u2019s Discovery Letter, dated September 20, 2019), HX \n3 (Department Counsel\u2019s waiver of objection to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions), \nand HX 4 (Closing Arguments with Rebuttal by Department Counsel). The record closed \non March 16, 2020, when I received Department Counsel\u2019s Rebuttal to Applicant\u2019s \nClosing Argument.  \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed 12 delinquent or \npast-due debts totaling $147,968 (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.l). In response, Applicant admitted with \nexplanation SOR 1.a, and he denied with explanations SOR 1.b \u2013 1.l. Under Guideline K, \nthe Government alleged that Applicant failed to properly perform his oversight duties as \nan information systems security officer (ISSO) (SOR 2.a); that in 2016 and 2017, he \nfalsified records to show that he had performed required audits of classified information \nsystems when he knew he had not done so (SOR 2.b); that in February 2016, Applicant \nviolated security procedures by leaving a computer hard drive unsecured (SOR 2.c); that \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nin May and December 2016, he failed to follow required security procedures related to his \npersonal travel abroad (SOR 2.d); and that in January 2017, he violated security \nprocedures by failing to properly secure a classified area and container (SOR 2.e). In \nresponse, Applicant denied with explanations SOR 2.a and 2.b, and he admitted with \nexplanations SOR 2.c \u2013 2.e. (Answer; Tr. 6 \u2013 7) In addition to the facts established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old and works in an information technology (IT) position for \na defense contractor. He was hired by his current employer in November 2017. Prior to \nhis current job, Applicant worked as an information systems security officer for a large \ndefense contractor (Company A) from June 2014 until November 2017. Applicant served \non active duty in the United States Navy from November 2000 until he was honorably \ndischarged as a petty officer first class in May 2011. Following his discharge, Applicant \naffiliated with the Navy Reserve where he continues to serve as a drilling reservist. After \nleaving high school, Applicant attended college for one year before enlisting in the Navy. \nWhile in the Navy, he obtained two associate\u2019s degrees. After leaving active duty, \nApplicant returned to the college he attended after high school and obtained a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in information technology in December 2013. Between May 2013 and November \n2014, he worked in two IT jobs before being hired by Company A. (GX 1; GX 2; AX B; AX \nC)  \n \n \nApplicant has been married twice. His first marriage began in September 2001 and \nended by divorce in March 2009. Together they have one child for whom Applicant is \nrequired to pay $750 in monthly support. Applicant remarried in April 2015. He and his \nwife now have three children together and his wife\u2019s child from before the marriage. \nApplicant also has another minor child for whom he pays $700 in monthly support. (GX \n1; GX 2; Tr. 16 \u2013 17) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s duties at Company A required his qualification for work with Special \nAccess Programs (SAP). These programs are compartmented within larger missions that \nrequire broader collateral access up to and including top secret clearances. SAP access \nand personnel security management is governed, in relevant part, by DOD Manual \n(DODM) 5205.07, Volume 2, Enclosure 5. Applicant\u2019s security clearance was first granted \nwhile he was on active duty. His 2014 e-QIP was submitted to renew his eligibility and \nlikely upgrade his access to top secret. Before being granted SAP access in 2014, he \ncompleted a Company A pre-screening process during which he disclosed much of the \nadverse financial information that is addressed in the SOR under Guideline F. Available \ninformation supports the factual allegations under Guideline F. Those debts alleged are, \nor were, properly attributable to Applicant. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 6) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems stem from the purchase of a house and an \nundeveloped lot in 2004. Applicant was still on active duty in State A and his first wife also \ncontributed income to the marital finances. Applicant used a reenlistment bonus to invest \nin the lot. In October 2005, Applicant was transferred cross country to State B, so he \nbegan to rent out the house in State A. In 2009, when he and his wife divorced, Applicant \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \ncould no longer rely on her income to cover all their expenses. At the same time, Applicant \nbegan paying child support. For a time, Applicant had renters in his State A house and \nwas able to cover the mortgage even after his divorce; however, in 2013 he incurred \nanother child support obligation and, in 2015, he was unable to afford major repairs to his \nrental property and he was forced to release his tenants from their lease. Thereafter, \nbecause Applicant was unable to cover his mortgage or sell the house, the mortgage was \nforeclosed in 2016. It does not appear from the most recent credit reports that Applicant \nhas any remaining obligation for the mortgage. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 6; AX G; Tr. 22 \u2013 29, 31, \n34, 88) \n \n \nAs to the undeveloped lot Applicant purchased in 2004, he also defaulted on that \nmortgage in 2015 for the same reasons his house mortgage was foreclosed. The value \nof the lot, which was part of a planned housing development, fell during the national \neconomic recession. As a result, he was unable to sell the lot to resolve the remaining \n$32,930 of his mortgage obligation and it was foreclosed in April 2016. The lot was later \nsold at auction for $34,000; however, a credit report in August 2016 reflected two civil \njudgments against Applicant in favor of the homeowners association (HOA) of that \ndevelopment (alleged at SOR 1.c and 1.d) totaling $13,749. In a June 2017 subject \ninterview, Applicant stated that he owed the HOA $3,000 for HOA fees he initially did not \nknow about. An initial judgment for $6,000 was obtained in September 2011. That action \nwas filed in State A\u2019s magistrate court, a court of limited jurisdiction. Another judgment for \n$7,749 was obtained in March 2015. That action was filed in State A\u2019s superior court, a \ncourt of general jurisdiction. Both judgments were obtained by default of Applicant. His \nposition throughout this adjudication has been that the debts alleged at SOR 1.c and 1.d \nare one in the same. He also believed his obligation for any HOA debt was resolved when \nthe mortgage on his lot was foreclosed. Available information is not conclusive as to the \nstatus of any remaining HOA obligation. Although both SOR 1.c and 1.d appeared on the \nAugust 2016 credit report, they do not appear on credit reports in March 2019, October \n2019, or January 2020. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 5; AX G; AX J; AX R; AX T; Tr. 29 \u2013 31, 33 \u2013 \n34, 86 \u2013 88) \n \n \nApplicant also became delinquent on other personal credit accounts. SOR 1.a \nrepresents a credit card account for $7,448 opened in 2001 that became delinquent in \n2017. Applicant initially did not act to resolve this debt on advice of a financial counseling \ncompany. According to a January 2020 credit report, Applicant at one point was in a \npartial repayment plan on this debt. According to a January 24, 2020 letter from the \ncreditor, Applicant has settled the debt by paying $1,489. Applicant also claims that the \nSOR 1.h debt to the same creditor is a duplicate of SOR 1.a. This was not controverted \nat hearing and the record evidence as a whole supports Applicant\u2019s claim in this regard. \n(AX H; Tr. 32, 84 \u2013 85) \n \n \nThe debt at SOR 1.b was for a student loan related to his undergraduate studies \nthat became delinquent in 2018 and was referred for collection in January 2019. Applicant \nresolved this debt in May 2019 as he was trying to qualify for a mortgage. (Answer; GX \n4; AX I; Tr. 32 \u2013 33, 85 \u2013 86) Applicant settled the delinquent credit card debt at SOR 1.f \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nin December 2017. The debts at SOR 1.j, 1.k and 1.l were for a delinquent cell phone \naccount, a delinquent electrical bill, and a delinquent bill for dental services, respectively. \nWhen Applicant left Company A in 2017, he paid SOR 1.j and 1.k with funds withdrawn \nfrom his Company A retirement account. He paid the SOR 1.l account in October 2016. \n(Answer; AX N; AX R; AX S; Tr. 40 \u2013 42) \n \n \nIn addition to his mortgage-related debts, Applicant also fell behind on his child \nsupport obligations to his ex-wife.  Those payments were ordered by the court as part of \ntheir divorce decree. When Applicant could no longer afford to pay his house and lot \nmortgages, his ex-wife agreed to take a lesser amount. Applicant continued to pay each \nmonth at the reduced amount for about two years; however, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife \nsubsequently petitioned the court to order Applicant to pay the balance he would have \npaid according to the original support order. That amount was the debt alleged at SOR \n1.g. The debt alleged at SOR 1.i is a duplicate of SOR 1.g. Applicant no longer owes the \ndebt at SOR 1.g. In addition to increased payments he has made on his $7,776 arrearage \nsince June 2011, $5,000 in federal income tax refunds for the 2014 and 2015 tax years \nwere diverted and applied to his child support debt. Applicant has always paid his child \nsupport obligations as required for his other child. His total child support obligation is now \n$1,293 each month. (Answer; GX 2 \u2013 5; AX M; AX O; Tr. 37 \u2013 40, 88) \n \n \nIn 2016, Applicant was considering filing for bankruptcy and was advised he would \nqualify for at least Chapter 13 protection. In the end, he decided to use funds from his \nCompany A 401k to resolve as much of his debt as possible. He also was told he would \nbe getting a raise at Company A; however, he left for a better opportunity with his current \nemployer. He now earns more than he would have even with the Company A raise, and \nhis working conditions are less stressful. In May 2019, Applicant and his wife obtained a \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) mortgage and bought a house. Applicant has been \nable to improve his credit score and resolve most of his debts since late 2017 and early \n2018. In October 2017, he enlisted the services of Lexington Law to resolve discrepancies \nin his credit history, help negotiate with some of his creditors, and to set up payment \nplans. In April 2018, he started working with Trinity Enterprises to accomplish similar \nfinancial goals, but with more focus on mortgage qualification. Applicant also submitted a \npersonal financial statement dated January 23, 2020 that shows he and his wife have \nabout $2,800 remaining each month after expenses. His income includes a monthly \n$2,237 disability benefit from the VA. (Answer; GX 2; AX D; AX G; AX AX O \u2013 R; Tr. 95) \n \n \nDuring his employment with Company A, Applicant committed multiple security \nviolations. On February 17, 2016, he was part of a team conducting a large-scale upgrade \nof system hardware and Windows operating systems. The effort involved between 300 \nand 400 workstations and required temporary storage of classified hard drives. The \nspecified manner of storage, even in spaces approved for open shelf storage, was to \nstore the drives in safes within those spaces. During a routine security inspection, a \nclassified hard drive, determined to be Applicant\u2019s responsibility, was found in a secure \nspec but not in an approved safe. (Answer; GX 2; GX 6; GX 8; Tr. 67 \u2013 70) \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nAt Company A, Applicant initially was assigned as the ISSO for a SAP program. \nHis duties involved security oversight of SAP information systems, including weekly audits \nof those systems to ensure compliance with government contract security requirements. \nSuch audits generally are intended to detect system connectivity issues and various data \nprocessing anomalies. Within the SAP programs to which he was assigned, Applicant\u2019s \narea of responsibility was limited to a manageable number of systems that could be \naudited automatically, and he did not experience any difficulties fulfilling his ISSO \nobligations. In late 2014, he was assigned additional duties to assist the ISSO for \ncollateral programs. At first Applicant was able to keep up with these tasks, which \ncomprised about half of his time on the job. It also appears that the ISSO Applicant was \nassigned to help had long been overworked in a job that required more than one or two \npersons to perform. Although Applicant was trained in the SAP automated systems audit \nprocess generally, he was not familiar with the procedures for auditing the more complex \nand interrelated collateral IT systems. His training was accomplished mainly through on-\nthe-job instruction by the incumbent. After a few months of stressful conditions, she \naccepted a transfer to a different, lower paying position to get away from the ISSO \nposition. Applicant was left as the sole ISSO responsible for auditing all of the collateral \nIT systems on site. He quickly found himself \u201cstretched thin\u201d and overwhelmed. (Answer; \nGX 2; Tr. 42 \u2013 47, 66 \u2013 67, 84) \n \n \nIn December 2016, in preparation for a government accountability review, \nCompany A conducted an internal inspection of its compliance with security requirements \nfor the IT systems Company A managed for the government at the site where Applicant \nwas employed. That inspection showed that Applicant had failed to conduct and/or \ndocument required weekly system audits for the program to which Applicant was \nassigned. Specifically, the inspection determined that weekly audits were not being \ncompleted with the required 100 percent accuracy each week and that Applicant had not \nsigned the audit logs as required. As to the accuracy requirement, Applicant \nacknowledged that he had omitted information regarding minor anomalies, but explained \nthat he had been advised this was acceptable by his predecessor. Applicant also admitted \nthat in April 2016, he stopped signing the physical audit completion sheet and started \nsigning it on an automated system. Doing so was a procedural violation and Applicant did \nnot seek guidance on this before changing that part of his audit methodology. Finally, it \nwas determined that Applicant had falsified the contents of audit-results folders for the \nnine weeks between July 13, 2016 and September 8, 2016. On review, although it first \nappeared that the folders were properly populated with audit results, it also was \ndetermined that the systems being audited could not have produced that information \nbecause they were not connected to the system domain that ran the audits and where \nthe folders resided. Had Applicant actually done the audits in question, he would have \nknown that the systems were not connected. During the Company A investigation into \nApplicant\u2019s audit discrepancies, Applicant acknowledged that he had not conducted the \naudits with 100 percent compliance. He also acknowledged that he did not make his \nsupervisors aware of his difficulties and concerns. On January 7, 2017, he was issued a \nwritten reprimand and warning. (Answer; GX 2; GX 6 \u2013 10; Tr. 47 \u2013 57, 59 \u2013 63, 90 \u2013 92) \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \n  As a result of the inspection, an internal Risk Assessments and Mitigating \nSystems (RAMS) review was conducted. In addition to the audit discrepancies and \nviolations, it was found that Applicant did not comply with DODM 5205.07 requirements \nfor reporting of personal foreign travel. In relevant part, SAP personnel are required to \nreport to the cognizant security official any planned foreign travel no less than 30 days in \nadvance. In December 2016, Applicant and his wife spent one afternoon (less than eight \nhours) in a foreign country when the cruise ship he was on made a brief port call. Applicant \nmentioned this part of his trip when he returned but had to be reminded to report it to \nsecurity. At the time, Applicant did not think such activity met the reporting requirement. \nIn May 2016, Applicant and his wife traveled for a week to a foreign country but gave only \neight days\u2019 notice rather than the required 30 days. Applicant claimed he had forgotten \nabout the trip, which his wife had arranged, until the week before he was to go on \nvacation. (Answer; GX 2; GX 6 \u2013 10; Tr. 63 \u2013 66) \n \n \nThe December 2016 Company A investigation into Applicant\u2019s audit discrepancies \nwas thoroughly documented and included statements by several witnesses and by \nApplicant himself. In addition to the written reprimand and warning, he was required to \ncomplete refresher training on general security procedures and on procedures specific to \nhis ISSO duties. Applicant also was counseled by his supervisors, who recognized that \nhe had been placed in a difficult situation. He was removed from SAP access and from \nthe collateral program where he committed his auditing violations; however, he continued \nto perform ISSO functions for a different collateral program, including audits for the \nremainder of his tenure at Company A. (GX 6 \u2013 10; Tr. 74 \u2013 79) \n \n \nIn 2017, Applicant committed two additional security violations before leaving \nCompany A. On January 30, 2017, he failed to properly secure a sensitive \ncompartmented information facility (SCIF) at the end of his workday. Although he properly \nactivated the alarm for that space, he did not completely secure a physical lock on the \ndoor. The lock was closed but was not properly on the hasp to secure the door. On \nMonday, February 13, 2017 Applicant signed an audit log indicating that he had \nperformed a required weekly audit of a particular computer workstation for activity on that \ncomputer for the preceding week, February 6 through February 10. A review of that \ncomputer on February 20, 2017 showed that no one had logged onto it after Wednesday, \nFebruary 8. Anyone auditing that workstation would have had to log onto it to perform the \nrequired audit. During a September 2018 subject interview, Applicant claimed that both \nviolations were due to mistake or oversight. As to the improperly secured SCIF, Applicant \nclaimed the circumstances were similar to a March 2015 violation when he failed to \nproperly secure a combination lock on the door to a different SCIF. These violations occur \noften and usually are a product of mundane repetition. As to the audit violation, Applicant \nclaimed he simply missed one of the ten stations he was tasked with auditing. The \nexplanation captured in the summary of his subject interview does not explain why he \nsigned the audit log for that station when he could not have performed the audit without \nlogging on to it. (GX 2; GX 8; Tr. 54, 71 \u2013 73)  \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant has an excellent reputation among his friends and his Navy Reserve \nshipmates. He also has established a sound record of performance for his current \nemployer. Information provided in this regard notes his reliability and good character. His \npersonal references are familiar with the SOR allegations and yet expressed no \nreservations about recommending Applicant for a position of trust. His active duty career \nincluded three Good Conduct Medals, a Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, \nand qualifications as an Enlisted Submarine Warfare Specialist. Applicant testified he has \nlearned from his mistakes at Company A, and he believes his biggest mistake was his \nfailure to more assertively advise his supervisors of the difficulties he was having and the \nneed for additional resources. (Answer; AX A \u2013 F; Tr. 78 \u2013 79). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518)  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s information established that Applicant accrued numerous \ndelinquent or past-due debts that as of the issuance of the SOR remained unresolved. \nThree mortgage or real property-related debts accounted for about 75 percent of the total \ndebt at issue. This information reasonably raised a security concern about Applicant\u2019s \nfinances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nApplicant did not pay the mortgages he obtained for the purchase of a house and \nan undeveloped lot in 2004. Both were foreclosed and at least one civil judgment was \nobtained against him by the HOA for the development where the lot was located. \nAdditionally, Applicant became delinquent on several personal accounts for credit cards, \ncell phones, electricity, and a student loan. Finally, Applicant fell behind on a child support \nobligation for the child of his first marriage. That debt resulted in the diversion of two years \nof income tax refunds to pay the arrearage due. All of the foregoing requires application \nof the following AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant responded with information showing that his financial problems arose \nfrom unforeseen or uncontrollable circumstances, namely, his divorce in 2009 meant less \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nincome and additional expenses in the form of child support. An additional child support \nobligation arose in 2013. By that time, he had left the military and not working full time \nbecause he was trying to complete his college education. Finally, the house he had been \nleasing out developed needed repairs that he could not afford with his limited resources. \nWithout being repaired, the house could not be leased and Applicant lost the rental \nincome he needed to cover the mortgage. After losing the house to foreclosure in 2016, \nApplicant had no further obligation for that account. Applicant also lost the lot to \nforeclosure, but it is not clear from this record if foreclosure of the lot extinguished \nApplicant\u2019s obligation to pay the HOA judgments. It also is not reasonable to conclude \nfrom this record that there is more than one judgment. It is more likely that the original \njudgment filed in a lower court was renewed in a court of record to preserve the higher \nbalance with accrued interest. In either case, Applicant is attempting to determine his \nobligation, if any, after foreclosure and his current finances show he has the means with \nwhich to resolve it.  Applicant paid the debts at SOR 1.f, 1.i, and 1.l before the SOR was \nissued. He also has resolved the debts at SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.h. Rather than file for \nbankruptcy, Applicant used funds from a Company A retirement account to resolve as \nmuch of his debt as he could under the circumstances. \n \nAs to his past-due child support obligations, Applicant does not benefit from the \nfact that most of that debt was resolved by tax refund diversions. Nonetheless, he has \nnever failed to pay at least part of either of his child support debts. The arrearage in one \nof those accounts arose out of the same circumstances that caused Applicant to lose his \nhouse and an investment property to foreclosure. Applicant has resolved the arrearage \non one of his child support accounts and has never missed paying the other. An \nexamination of his current finances shows that he has significant positive cash flow each \nmonth, that he has not incurred any new past-due or delinquent debts since 2016, and \nthat he manages his finances in a prudent fashion. Between late 2017 and early 2019, he \nworked with two credit repair and counseling companies in late 2017 to negotiate with his \ncreditor, organize repayment of his debts, and improve his credit so that he could buy \nanother house, which he did in May 2019.  \n \nAll of the foregoing supports application of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating \nconditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \nAvailable information about Applicant\u2019s response to his financial problems, and about his \ncurrent finances, is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns under this guideline. \n \nHandling Protected Information \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant committed several security violations \nwhile employed at Company A in 2016 and 2017. Available information reasonably raised \na security concern about Applicant\u2019s willingness or ability to properly safeguard sensitive \ninformation. That security concern is stated at AG \u00b6 33: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \n \nIn 2016 and 2017, Applicant intentionally made false statements when he attested \nby his signature that he had conducted audits of government IT systems as required and \nin the manner specified by the government. He also committed other seemingly \ninadvertent violations through not properly reporting his foreign travel, failing to fully \nsecure a SCIF, and leaving a classified hard drive improperly secured. Applicant \ncommitted two of the documented violations in January and February 2017 after being \nscrutinized and counseled during an exhaustive internal investigation of his failure to \ncomply with audit procedures in 2016. His February 2017 violation was a repeat of his \naudit failures and involved a deliberate falsification of the audit log. I also remain \nconcerned about the validity of the explanation of that incident he provided to an \ninvestigator in September 2018. All of the foregoing requires application of the following \nAG \u00b6 34 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation; and \n \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \n \n \nI also have considered the potential application of the following AG \u00b6 35 mitigating \nconditions: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n \n12 \n \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 35(d) applies, in part, to Applicant\u2019s travel reporting violations, his failure to \nfully secure a SCIF, and his improper storage of a single hard drive. All three can be \nascribed to unintentional oversight or to a misunderstanding of the particular security \nrequirement at issue. However, mitigation of these incidents is limited because they are \npart of a larger history of violations. \n \nAG \u00b6 35(c) does not apply. Although before the fact, Applicant was not trained \nspecifically in how to audit collateral systems, all of the information probative of his audit \nviolations shows that he understood what was required of him. On the issue of being \noverwhelmed, that may well have been the case; however, he also knew he should have \nalerted his chain of command to the fact that he was not meeting his assigned obligations \nfor whatever the reason was. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 35(c) does not apply. After being made aware of his audit discrepancies and \nviolations by the results of the internal investigation in December 2016, Applicant received \ncounseling and refresher training about his security and ISSO responsibilities. \nNonetheless, in February 2017, he failed to complete a required audit and deliberately \nfalsified the audit signature sheet to give the impression that he had done the audit. \nFurther contributing to the security concern about this event is the version of events that \nhe provided to an investigator in September 2018, which directly contradicts the findings \nof the Company A investigation conducted in February 2017. This information also \nundermines application of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 35(b). On balance, the record \nevidence as a whole precludes mitigation of the security concerns raised under this \nguideline. \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). I note in particular Applicant\u2019s record of military service and his good \nperformance in his current job. I also recognize the good judgment exhibited in attempting \nto resolve the financial difficulties he experienced due to factors beyond his control. \nNonetheless, this positive information is not sufficient to overcome the significant security \nramifications of his multiple and, at times, deliberate security violations. Those concerns \nremain unresolved and sustain doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for continued access \nto classified information. Because protection of the interests of national security is the \nprincipal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the \nApplicant\u2019s request for clearance. \n \n\n \n \n13 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She incurred delinquent debts due to financial \nhardship. She is making a reasonable and good-faith effort to repay her creditors. The \nevidence is sufficient to mitigate her history of financial problems. Accordingly, this case \nis decided for Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non May 4, 2018. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on April 23, 2019, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \n\n \n2 \n \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 15, 2019. She admitted the factual \nallegations, she provided a three-page memorandum and supporting documentation, \nand she requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n  \nThe case was assigned to me on September 6, 2019. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on September 25, 2019. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-4. Applicant \noffered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-K. Other than \nApplicant, no witnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on \nOctober 7, 2019.    \n \nThe record was kept open until October 16, 2019, to provide Applicant an \nopportunity to submit additional documentation. She made a timely submission, and the \nadditional documents (along with the e-mail correspondence) are admitted without \nobjections as Exhibit L.       \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for the first time. She works as a background investigator for a company in \nthe defense industry. She has been so employed since September 2018. (Tr. 45) She \nearned an associate degree in 1995, a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration \nand management in 1997, and a master\u2019s degree in business management in 2000. \nShe is married and has three children, the first born in 2000 and twins born in 2005. Her \nhusband was self-employed in the plumbing business until 2018, when he accepted a \njob with a municipality.  \n  \nBefore her current job, Applicant\u2019s employment history was a bit inconsistent or \nuneven. She worked as a master scheduler for a company during 2006-2011, when she \ndeparted due to the demands of raising twins. For the next several years she worked, \nwithout monetary compensation, as the office manager for her husband\u2019s plumbing \nbusiness. Her hours were irregular, perhaps ten hours weekly. During this time, she \ndecided to pursue a career in education as a teacher. She enrolled in a local university \nto obtain a teacher\u2019s certificate. She financed her attendance with two student loans in \nthe amounts of $9,000, loan date 09/01/2015, and $12,500, loan date 10/28/2014, for a \ntotal of $21,500. (Exhibit L at 4) \n \n \nAfter Applicant obtained a teacher\u2019s certificate, she was unable to find a full-time \njob teaching. She worked part-time as a substitute teacher for the local school district \nduring 2013-2018 earning about $60 daily. (Tr. 32, 45) The income was not sufficient to \nallow her to maintain regular payments on her student loans, and she eventually \ndefaulted. Per credit reports from 2018 and 2019, the loans had outstanding balances of \n$5,385 and $15,773, for a total of $21,158, when placed for collection. (Exhibits 2 and \n3)   \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe SOR alleged and Applicant admitted a history of financial problems. In \naddition to her admissions, factual allegations in the SOR are established by the \ndocumentary evidence. (Exhibits 2-4) The SOR concerns the two student loans \nmentioned above now in collection and two medical collection accounts in the amounts \nof $1,186 and $295.  \n \n \nBoth student loans are in collection with the same creditor. (Exhibits A, B, C, D, \nG, H, I, and L) The balance on the account as of September 20, 2019, was $17,497. \nThe outstanding balance was reduced substantially in April 2019, when a federal \nincome tax refund of $6,365 was applied. Applicant entered into a payment \narrangement with the creditor in about May 2019, when she agreed to make a monthly \npayment, initially $366 and then reduced to $143, beginning in June 2019, and she has \nmade the payments as agreed.   \n \n \nBoth medical collection accounts are in collection with the same creditor. \n(Exhibits E, F, G, H, I, and L) The accounts stem from emergency-room visits in 2012 \nand 2013. The balance on the account as of September 19, 2019, was $986. Applicant \nentered into a payment arrangement with the creditor in about May 2019, when she \nagreed to make 12 monthly payments of $124 beginning in June 2019, and she has \nmade the payments as agreed.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debts to financial hardship brought about by a \nlack of income after she left her job as a master scheduler in 2011 in order to attend to \nfamily responsibilities. (Tr. 43; Answer to SOR) Her husband\u2019s plumbing business and \nher part-time work as a substitute teacher did not generate enough income to meet all \ntheir financial obligations. In addition, her ability to repay the delinquent debts was \naffected by expensive dental care incurred in 2019. (Exhibit K) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s overall financial situation has stabilized. A written budget she \nprepared reflects a positive net monthly remainder of about $396. (Exhibit J) Her \nhusband is now a salaried employee earning about $54,000 annually. (Tr. 47-50) She is \npaid hourly and quarterly bonus pay. She estimated her 2019 gross income at about \n$42,000. (Tr. 47-50) In addition, their financial assets consist of retirement accounts and \nabout $133,000 in home equity. (Tr. 51-54)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n4 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed \nunder the substantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are due to \nunderemployment and unemployment, which, combined with her husband\u2019s irregular \nincome as a self-employed plumber, resulted in financial hardship. She acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances, as shown by her remedial actions in addressing \nthe student loans and the medical collection accounts. Given the circumstances, the \nmitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor.   \n \n \nApplicant made a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent financial accounts. \nShe receives credit for entering into repayment arrangements with the creditor for the \nstudent loans and the creditor for the medical collection accounts. She is making \nprogress in repaying the student loans and will pay off the medical collection accounts \nover the course of 12 monthly payments. Given the circumstances, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nApplicant presented a good but less than perfect case in mitigation, but, as in all \nhuman affairs, perfection is not the standard. A security clearance case is not a debt-\ncollection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt \nalleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement \nthat an applicant make payments on all the delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is \nthere a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nHere, I am persuaded that Applicant is making an honest effort to be financially \nresponsible and repay her creditors. There are clear indications that her financial \nproblems are under control. Her overall financial situation has improved with the benefit \nof her full-time employment and her husband\u2019s regular income as a salaried employee. \nIt is probable that she will continue to make the agreed upon monthly payments and \nresolve outstanding debts. Taking everything into account, Applicant demonstrated \ngood judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness by persevering under difficult \ncircumstances. The financial considerations concern is mitigated.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she met her ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant her eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

He earned his Bachelor of Science degree from a maritime academy in 1987. He served honorably in the U.S. Naval Merchant Marine Reserves from 1987 until 1995. Since at least 2007, he has worked aboard U.S. military vessels as a contractor for various employers.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/21/2020 \nDecision \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 19, \n2017. On August 5, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 17, 2019, and requested a decision \non the written record without a hearing. On October 16, 2019, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding documents identified as Items 1 through 4. He was given an opportunity to \nsubmit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, \nmitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on \nOctober 28, 2019, and did not respond. Item 1 contains the pleadings in the case. Items \n\n \n2 \n \n2 through 4 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on January 3, \n2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 54, has never married nor has any children. He cohabited with his \ngirlfriend from 1995 until she passed away in 2017. He earned his Bachelor of Science \ndegree from a maritime academy in 1987. He served honorably in the U.S. Naval \nMerchant Marine Reserves from 1987 until 1995. Since at least 2007, he has worked \naboard U.S. military vessels as a contractor for various employers. He has been \nemployed full time as a second mate by the same defense contractor since February \n2013. He previously held a DOD security clearance from approximately 2001 through \n2011. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns, as required, \nfor at least tax years 2008 through 2017. In each of those tax years, he filed extensions. \nThe status of his returns or extensions for tax year 2018 was not addressed in the \nrecord. While he attributed his filing delays primarily to being underway and overseas as \na merchant seaman for large periods of time, he also acknowledged that his \nprocrastination played a role. Since at least November 2009, Applicant has lived aboard \nthe vessels on a schedule of between two to four months on and two to four months off. \nAs of September 2019, he had been working the latter. During his off periods, he \nattends trainings. (Item 1; Item 3 at 7, 9-10) \n \nApplicant filed his 2008 and 2009 federal and state returns in October 2013. For \nthose tax years, he did not owe any federal taxes, and paid the $15,000 state taxes that \nhe owed by credit card. For tax years 2010 through 2017, he does not anticipate owing \nany federal taxes due to having the maximum federal taxes withheld from his \npaychecks. However, because he does not have state taxes withheld from his \npaychecks, he anticipates that he will owe state taxes. He will not know the amounts \ndue until he files his returns. He proffered that he is willing and able to pay any state \ntaxes owed, assuming that he is able to negotiate a monthly repayment plan. His future \nintent is to timely file his returns and pay his taxes. (Item 3 at 9-10, 11) \n \nDuring his September 2017 security clearance interview, Applicant asserted that \nhe had sought the assistance of an accounting firm to file his 2010 through 2017 \nreturns. At that time, he anticipated that the returns would be filed by the end of 2018. \nHe also explained that he had been busy \u201chandling details and business aspects\u201d of his \ngirlfriend\u2019s estate following her death in \u201crecent months.\u201d In his July 2019 response to \ninterrogatories, Applicant acknowledged that his returns had not yet been filed. He had \nnot been able to gather the documents required by the accounting firm due, in part, to \nthe grief he experienced because of his girlfriend\u2019s death and, in part, to his work \nschedule. He had been on a vessel since May 1, 2019 and anticipated that he would file \nthe returns once he returned home. (Item 3 at 4-6, 9-10) \n \nIn his September 2019 SOR response, Applicant acknowledged that his returns \nremained unfiled. He reiterated that his girlfriend\u2019s passing and work schedule \n\n \n3 \n \ncontinued to impact his ability to file his delinquent returns. However, he also admitted \nthat he did not \u201cfully understand\u201d until he received the SOR that him \u201cnot filing taxes\u201d \nwas influencing the decision as to whether or not to grant him a security clearance. He \nasked for more time to file his returns. While he did not specify a timeframe, he \nanticipated that they would be filed \u201cwithin a reasonable amount of time.\u201d (Item 1) \n \nApplicant was involuntarily unemployed from January 2012 through February \n2013, during which time he supported himself through savings and unemployment \ncompensation. Before her passing, his girlfriend assisted Applicant in managing his \nfinances while he was on the vessels. Applicant\u2019s employment income consists of an \nunspecified bi-weekly salary paid while he is on the vessel, plus an additional $10,000 \nto $12,000 paid after he is off the vessel as a payout of benefits. In September 2017, \nApplicant reported that he had approximately $40,000 in credit-card debt, including the \n$15,000 he charged in October 2013 to pay his 2008 and 2009 state taxes. His October \n2019 credit report revealed no delinquent debts and that he was paying the monthly \npayments as agreed on eight credit-card accounts with balances totaling $55,093. (Item \n1; Item 3 at 8, 10-11; Item 4) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2)) \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \n\n \n4 \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012))  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2010 through 2017, as required, establishes the following disqualifying condition \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired). \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \nApplicant repeatedly failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns \nover an extended period of time. His work schedule and girlfriend\u2019s 2017 death explain \nfiling delays up to a certain point. However, the record suggests that his ongoing \nprocrastination played a more significant role. Moreover, the fact that he apparently \nlacks sufficient funds to pay his state taxes further undercuts mitigation. He has not \nactually resolved his 2008 and 2009 taxes because the $15,000 credit-card debt he \nincurred to pay them remains outstanding. Applicant\u2019s 2010 through 2017 federal and \nstate returns not only remain unfiled, but he has not proffered a specific plan as to when \nor how they will be filed.  \n \nApplicant is credited with filing his 2008 and 2009 returns well before being \nprompted by the security clearance process. However, his persistent delay in filing his \nremaining returns beyond any justifiable excuses does not demonstrate responsible \naction and calls into question his suitability for access to classified information. A person \nwho fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing income tax returns \nwhen due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. (See ISCR Case No. 14-\n01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015)). \u201cFailure to file income tax returns suggests that \nan applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules and \nsystems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting \nclassified information.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)). I am \nleft with doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns over an \nextended period of time. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about August 2014 to at least January 2018, and that he intends to use marijuana in the future (SOR \u00b6 1.a). When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the allegation without comment. After considering the FORM, including Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR (Item 2), and Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 31 years old and unmarried. He was in a cohabitant relationship as of his July 2017 application for a DOD clearance. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in August 2010 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2016. He has been employed as a proposal analyst with a defense contractor since April 2017. There is no evidence that he has ever held a DOD security clearance. (Items 3-4.) On July 10, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a security clearance application (SCA) on which he disclosed that he had used marijuana recreationally in college at a frequency of two to four times a week, primarily on the weekends, between approximately August 2014 and December 2016.

Price, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n02/12/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant used marijuana two to four times per week from August 2014 to December \n2016, and once in October 2017 and January 2018. Although he no longer associates with \nindividuals who use marijuana, he has failed to convincingly commit to abstaining from \nmarijuana in the future. Clearance eligibility is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 11, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing a security \nconcern under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. The SOR explained \nwhy the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, to all adjudications for \nnational security eligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n\n2 \n \nOn July 11, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR allegation and requested a decision \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. On November 29, 2019, the Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 4. The Government forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant on December 3, \n2019, and instructed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant \nreceived the FORM on December 11, 2019, and he responded on January 6, 2020. On \nJanuary 13, 2020, Department Counsel indicated that the Government had no objection to \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM. On January 24, 2020, the case was assigned to me to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case file on February 3, 2020. I \naccepted Items 1 through 4 into the record as exhibits for the Government. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the FORM was admitted as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nAugust 2014 to at least January 2018, and that he intends to use marijuana in the future \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a). When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the allegation without \ncomment. After considering the FORM, including Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR (Item 2), \nand Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and unmarried. He was in a cohabitant relationship as of \nhis July 2017 application for a DOD clearance. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in August \n2010 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2016. He has been employed as a proposal \nanalyst with a defense contractor since April 2017. There is no evidence that he has ever \nheld a DOD security clearance. (Items 3-4.) \n \nOn July 10, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a security \nclearance application (SCA) on which he disclosed that he had used marijuana \nrecreationally in college at a frequency of two to four times a week, primarily on the \nweekends, between approximately August 2014 and December 2016. He responded \naffirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he intended to use marijuana in the future \nand stated, \u201cAccounting for its trend toward legalization I will most likely use it when it can \nbe done in a way that does not violate state law.\u201d Applicant also responded \u201cYes\u201d to an \ninquiry concerning whether he had been involved in the last seven years in the \u201cillegal \npurchase, manufacture, cultivation, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, \nhandling or sale of a drug or controlled substance.\u201d  He disclosed that he had purchased \nmarijuana every three to four weeks between August 2014 and December 2016 \u201cto support \nconsumption during college.\u201d  He denied any intention to purchase marijuana in the future. \n(Item 3.) \n \nOn April 12, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He indicated about his drug involvement that he \nhad purchased marijuana through a previous girlfriend\u2019s drug-dealing contacts about twice \na week between August 2014 and December 2016. He consumed marijuana two to four \ntimes a week in his residence or at his ex-girlfriend\u2019s residence with his ex-girlfriend and \n\n3 \n \nher roommate. Applicant volunteered that, after completing his SCA, he ate cookies \ncontaining marijuana while alone in his home on October 4, 2017, and again on January 1, \n2018. He also smoked some marijuana on the latter occasion. Applicant admitted that he \nknew his use of marijuana was illegal. He purchased the marijuana that he used in October \n2017 and January 2018 from a drug dealer in October 2017. Regarding his future \nintentions, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he has thought about using marijuana \nin the future in a state where it is legal. He acknowledged knowing that he should not do \nso, but also stated that it is tempting to use marijuana in a store where it can be purchased \nlegally, and that he might use marijuana again. Applicant denied any current association \nwith any individuals who use illegal drugs, and he claimed marijuana had no adverse \nimpact on his personality, judgment, reliability, or ability to hold a confidence. Applicant \nalso denied that his use of illegal drugs could be a source of blackmail or coercion because \nhis cohabitant girlfriend knows about his drug use. On April 16, 2018, the OPM investigator \nre-interviewed Applicant by telephone. There is no indication that Applicant\u2019s drug use was \ndiscussed during that contact. (Item 4.) \n \nBy way of interrogatories, the DOD provided Applicant with summarized reports of \nhis April 12, 2018 and April 16, 2018 interviews with the OPM investigator. Applicant \naffirmed on May 10, 2019 that the summarized reports were accurate without any comment \nor corrections. (Item 4.) \n \nOn June 11, 2019, an SOR was issued to Applicant alleging that he used marijuana \nand that he intends to use it in the future. Applicant admitted the allegation without \ncomment on July 11, 2019. In the Government\u2019s FORM, Applicant was informed that \nmarijuana remains illegal under federal law, despite its legalization in some states. In \nresponse, Applicant asserted on January 6, 2020, that he is not an unacceptable security \nrisk. He could not be coerced into providing any privileged information; that his previous \nand current employers can attest to his character as hardworking and team-oriented; and \nthat he has received numerous awards as well as a promotion due to his work ethic and \nmoral fiber. With respect to the conflict between some state laws and the federal \ngovernment regarding the use of marijuana, Applicant stated: \n \nThe current legal and cultural status of marijuana is baffling. This substance \nis currently enjoyed recreationally in an ever-increasing number of states and \nutilized medicinally in even more. Despite being legal at the state level, the \nfederal government maintains a schedule one status for marijuana. However, \nthe federal government has elected to not enforce these laws in states which \nhave allowed for legal/decriminalized use. The mixed message that is being \nsent by the federal government indicates that the current law is now \noutdated. Therefore, it is questionable that my past use shows a willful \ndisregard for complying with laws, rules and regulations; as current federal \npolicy doesn\u2019t comply with the law itself, which serves to undermine its \nauthority. (AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM is silent on the issue of whether he intends to use \nmarijuana in the future. He presented no documentation of his work performance or any \n\n4 \n \ncharacter references to corroborate his assertions of his value to his past or present \nemployer. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nApplicant illegally used marijuana two to four times per week with an ex-girlfriend \nand her roommate in college between August 2014 and December 2016. Since earning his \nbachelor\u2019s degree, he used marijuana at least twice alone in his residence. He ate cookies \ncontaining marijuana on October 4, 2017, and used marijuana by smoking and by ingesting \nmarijuana in an edible on January 1, 2018. On his SCA, Applicant indicated about any \nfuture marijuana use that he \u201cwill most likely use it when it can be done in a way that does \nnot violate state law.\u201d During his April 2018 interview, he told an OPM investigator that he \nfinds it tempting to use marijuana in a store where it can be purchased legally, and so he \nmight use it again. Three disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 apply. They are: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement in substance misuse, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 25(c), Applicant illegally purchased marijuana from a drug dealer \ntwice a week between August 2014 and December 2016, and again in October 2017. His \npurchases of marijuana cannot be considered as a separate basis for disqualification \nbecause marijuana purchase was not alleged in the SOR. However, I cannot ignore the \ncircumstances of his marijuana use, and the evidence shows that that he had illegal \npossession of marijuana from October 2017 to January 2018. In January 2018, Applicant \nused the remainder of the marijuana he had purchased in October 2017. \n \n\n6 \n \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. AG \u00b6 26 \nprovides for mitigation as follows: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility;  \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Regarding AG \u00b6 26(a), Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana was limited to two occasions after college. Even so, it occurred after he applied \nfor a DOD security clearance, after he started working for a defense contractor, and in \nknowing disregard of its illegality. He purchased marijuana in October 2017 after he had \nstated on his July 2017 that he did not intent to purchase marijuana in the future. \nMoreover, as recently as April 2018, Applicant admitted to an OPM investigator that he \nmight use marijuana in the future in a state where marijuana has been legalized. It cannot \nreasonably be concluded that his marijuana use is unlikely to recur. \n \nApplicant is credited under AG \u00b6 26(b) with acknowledging his marijuana use and \npurchases. He disclosed his marijuana use and purchases when he completed his SCA \nand detailed the circumstances of his marijuana use during his April 12, 2018 interview with \nan OPM investigator. However, while he no longer associates with the ex-girlfriend or her \nroommate involved in his drug use in college, his disassociation with them carries little \nweight in mitigation, given he purchased marijuana in October 2017 for his personal \nconsumption and then used it alone in his home in October 2017 and January 2018. \nApplicant has not submitted a signed statement of intention to abstain from future use of \n\n7 \n \nmarijuana. Instead, he expresses disagreement with marijuana being a Schedule I \nprohibited drug under federal law; considers the current federal law as \u201coutdated;\u201d and \nbelieves that the federal government undermines its own authority by not enforcing the law \nagainst use of marijuana in states where it has been legalized or decriminalized. \n \nThe decriminalization or legalization of limited recreational marijuana use by some \nstates does not alter existing federal drug laws. Selective enforcement by the federal \ngovernment because it may not be the most effective use of time and resources to \nprosecute a person whose involvement with marijuana would not be criminal in his or her \nstate does not alter existing adjudicative guidelines. An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use of marijuana remains relevant in adjudicating his or her eligibility for \noccupying a sensitive national security position. Applicant\u2019s knowing disregard of federal \nlaw regarding the use of marijuana raises doubts about his willingness to comply with laws, \nregulations, and policies concerning the protection of classified information with which he \nmay disagree. He has not demonstrated a clear and convincing commitment to abstain \nfrom marijuana in the future. He has repeatedly expressed that he might use marijuana in \nthe future if he is in a state where he can do so legally. The drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).1 Applicant can disagree with federal drug law and policy without negative \nconsequences for his security clearance eligibility provided he does not act to violate the \nlaw or policy. Applicant has not demonstrated that he is willing to comply with the federal \nlaw and the DOD\u2019s prohibition against any marijuana use. By using marijuana in knowing \ndisregard of federal law, Applicant cast serious doubt about whether he can be counted on \nto comply with the requirements for handling classified information. \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended to punish applicants for past \ntransgressions. Yet it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). The \nGovernment must be able to rely on those persons granted security clearance eligibility to \nfulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, regulations, and policies, and without regard \nto their personal interests. Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana use and his failure to commit to \n                                                 \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows:  \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n8 \n \nabstinence in the future raised enough doubt in that regard to where I am unable to \nconclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal finding for or against Applicant on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, is: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(FORM, Item 4 at 1) As a contractor, Applicant\u2019s salary was affected each time a new company won his employment contract. Each time, this resulted in a pay reduction. His salary was thus reduced by over $23,000 in the past decade.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nIn a response notarized on June 12, 2019, Applicant answered the allegations \nraised in the SOR and requested a decision based on the written record by a Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge.

(FORM, Item 4 at 1) As a contractor, Applicant\u2019s \nsalary was affected each time a new company won his employment contract. Each time, \nthis resulted in a pay reduction. His salary was thus reduced by over $23,000 in the past \ndecade. (Response to FORM, at 2) \nAt issue in the SOR are four financial situation: \nFirst (1.a), is a charged-off account for approximately $12,712 for an automotive \ndebt which arose after Applicant\u2019s 2010 bankruptcy petition. Applicant\u2019s credit report \nnotes a date of last activity on this account as October 2017. (FORM, Item 4) In May \n2019, Applicant negotiated a payment plan on this balance. After his third timely \npayment plan, he satisfied the debt balance in August 2019. (AE 1, 1-2) This debt was \nresolved and SATISFIED with the help of funds received from a bank settlement. (AE \n1a, 2; 1b) \nSecond (1.b) and third (1.c), are student loan collection accounts for about \n$28,660 and $22,253, respectively. They predate his 2011 bankruptcy petition, survived \nthat action, and then were forgotten or overlooked. They have been rehabilitated and \nare now subject to a regular repayment plan. Evidence of the established repayment \nplan and regular payments started in July 2019 were presented. (AE 2) IN \nREPAYMENT \nFourth (1.d), in September 2010, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nprotection and claimed approximately $481,180 in outstanding liabilities. He attributed \nhis need for bankruptcy largely to \u201cvarious and cumulative issues.\u201d (FORM, Item 3, \nPersonal Interview at 4, 8) Specifically, he cited to a poor choice in financing his home \nwith an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) in 2005, and a subsequent, rapid increase in \nmortgage payments. In addition, he also cited to an estimated $20,000 salary cut he \n\n \n \n \n \n3\ntook to stay on his employment contract. (FORM, Item 3, Personal Interview at 4, 8) \nThat bankruptcy was discharged in around January 2011. Elsewhere, he mentioned his \nwife had had a gaming problem.  \n \n \nToday, Applicant is living within his means and his salary is stable. There are no \nother delinquent debts at issue. His student loan payments are reasonable and \nmanageable. He is contrite that the delinquent debts at issue were not previously noted \nand honored. Applicant is proud to be continuing to serve in furtherance of the U.S. \ngovernment and military. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence, and transcends \nduty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in those \ngranted such access. Decisions necessarily include consideration of the possible risk an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions \nshall be in terms of the national interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhad multiple delinquent debts and filed for bankruptcy in 2010. This is sufficient to \ninvoke financial considerations disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nUnder these facts, three conditions could mitigate related security concerns:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problems from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-\nprofit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or under control; and  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nBeyond Applicant\u2019s control, in terms of financial issues affecting his financial \nstatus were his wife\u2019s gambling problem and a notable reduction in income situations \u2013 \nboth adversely affecting his ability to make payments on an unwieldy ARM mortgage \nand other expenses. When his debt became uncontrollable, he filed for bankruptcy, \nwhich would have included the required financial counseling component. Nearly a \ndecade later, he was faced with three comparatively fresh delinquent debts \u2013 an \nautomotive collection, plus two student loan collection accounts that became overlooked \nwhen they failed to qualify for inclusion in Applicant\u2019s 2010 bankruptcy petition. Once \napprised of these debts, he quickly satisfied the automotive collection, and rehabilitated \nhis student loans so as to now be in regular payment status. Consequently, I find AG \u00b6 \n20(b)-AG \u00b6 20(d) apply. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nWith almost two decades of honorable military service to his credit, Applicant is \npresently a 60-year-old communication specialist who has worked in the same position \nsince mid-2017. He has completed some postsecondary coursework in the past dozen \nyears. Applicant is married with two children in their early teens. He has successfully \nmaintained a security clearance without adverse incident for many years, except for the \nSOR concerns. His income is currently stable and he is living within his means. \n \nUnable to adjust to the reductions in government contractor salaries near the \nbeginning of this century, along with broad variances in ARM percentage payments and \nhis wife\u2019s gambling, Applicant resorted to bankruptcy protection in 2010 to achieve a \nfresh start. That petition a decade ago, however, did not include the automotive debt \nand two student loans now at issue. When apprised that these accounts were existent \nand delinquent, he quickly satisfied the former, then rehabilitated his delinquent student \nloans to the point they are now in a reasonable, regular repayment plan. He did so \nexpediently after receiving the SOR, and he did so without either hesitation or financial \ndifficulty. Proud of his past years of honorable military service, Applicant was eager to \nmeet his obligations and contrite over the existence of these financial blemishes. Living \nwithin his means today, Applicant is able to care for his family and honor his creditors \ngoing forward. While repeated financial counseling could benefit in terms of unusual or \nunexpected contingencies in the future, it is clear he has his finances under control. \nConsequently, I find Applicant has mitigated financial considerations security concerns.  \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n                       \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Nagel, Esq. Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Daniel G. Barker, Esq.   \n \n03/12/2020 \nDecision \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. His financial problems were due to underemployment \nand unemployment as well as relying on the services of a tax preparer who prepared \nerroneous federal tax returns. He initiated a good-faith effort to repay his delinquent \ndebts and resolved all five of the delinquent debts at issue. He also entered into an \ninstallment agreement with the IRS to repay the back taxes he owes for multiple tax \nyears. The evidence is sufficient to mitigate his history of financial problems. \nAccordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.    \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non January 18, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on April 24, 2019, after reviewing the application and \nthe information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \n\n \n2 \n \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 20, 2019. He admitted the factual \nallegations and he provided brief explanations and supporting documentation. He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n  \nThe case was assigned to me on September 3, 2019. The hearing took place on \nDecember 3, 2019. Applicant appeared with counsel. Department Counsel offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-5. Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-F. Other than Applicant, no \nwitnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on December 11, \n2019.   \n \nThe record was kept open to provide Applicant an opportunity to submit \ndocumentation concerning his military service. Applicant made a timely submission, and \nthe additional documents are admitted without objections as Exhibit G.       \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 65-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance in the defense industry, although he held a top-secret security clearance \nduring his military service. He works as a quality assurance or quality control inspector \nin avionics. He has been so employed since January 2017. He was in a long-term \nmarriage until his wife passed away in 2018. He has four adult children. He is paid \nhourly, and he estimated his gross income for 2019 at about $66,000.  \n \nBefore his current job, Applicant\u2019s employment history was inconsistent resulting \nin insufficient income to meet his living expenses. (Exhibit 1; Tr. 33-34) For example, his \nemployment history as reported in his SF 86 shows the following: (1) he was a \ncustomer-service representative for a staffing agency during 2016-2017; (2) he was \nunemployed for a period of about four months in 2016; (3) he worked part-time as a \nnight stocker for a grocery store for several months during 2015-2016; (4) he was \nunemployed for about five months in 2015; (5) he worked as a quality inspector \n(electronics) for a staffing agency for about three months in 2015; and (6) he was \nunemployed for about five months during 2014-2015.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history also includes honorable service in the U.S. Air \nForce. (Exhibit G) His primary specialty was working in the field of aircraft electrical and \nenvironmental systems. He retired from military service in 2001 with 23 years of service. \nHe receives retired pay as well as disability compensation from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs due to a 40% disability rating. Together, it amounts to about $3,000 \nmonthly.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe SOR alleged and Applicant admitted a history of financial problems. In \naddition to his admissions, factual allegations in the SOR are established by the \ndocumentary evidence. (Exhibits 2-5) The SOR concerns five collection of charged-off \naccounts for a total of about $34,249; $10,000 in back taxes owed to the IRS for tax \nyear 2014; and $10,000 in back taxes owed to the IRS for tax year 2015.  \n \nThe largest of the delinquent financial accounts is a $26,496 charged-off account \nstemming from an automobile loan. (Exhibit A) Applicant purchased a used vehicle in \nJuly 2014 with dealer financing that included interest at an annual percentage rate of \n26%. He recalls the vehicle was repossessed several months later. The account was \nresolved (paid in full and/or settled in full) in July 2019. \n \nApplicant paid in full a $792 collection account stemming from a cable TV \naccount in May 2019. (Exhibit B) \n \nApplicant paid in full a $128 collection account stemming from a credit card \naccount in May 2019. (Exhibit C) He disputes the account, but elected to pay it given \nthe low-dollar amount.  \n \nApplicant had a $2,082 judgment entered against him in 2015 stemming from an \neviction action on a rental property. He paid the judgment creditor $4,493 in May 2019, \nand the judgment is now satisfied. (Exhibit D) \n \nApplicant had a $4,751 judgment entered against him in 2015 stemming from a \nrental property. He resolved the debt with the creditor, and the judgment was satisfied in \nOctober 2019. (Exhibit E) \n \nApplicant is in the process of resolving his indebtedness to the IRS. (Exhibit F) \nHe began making monthly payments in about July 2019. His proposal to have monthly \ninstallment payments automatically deducted from his checking account was approved \nby the IRS in September 2019. The agreed upon monthly payment is $538. The \ninstallment agreement covers multiple tax years, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and \n2018. Applicant estimated he owes back taxes of $35,000 to $40,000 in total. (Tr. 30) \nHe attributes falling behind on taxes to relying on a tax preparer who prepared \nerroneous federal tax returns, which led to an IRS audit. He believes he has more than \nsufficient cash flow to make the monthly installment payment given his current wages \ncoupled with his retired pay and disability compensation, which resulted in a gross \nincome of about $100,000 in 2019.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n4 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed \nunder the substantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) . . . failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is incompliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are due to \nunderemployment and unemployment as well as relying on the services of a tax \npreparer who prepared erroneous federal tax returns. Those circumstances were largely \nbeyond his control. Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, as evidenced \nby his remedial actions. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies in Applicant\u2019s favor.   \n \n \nApplicant made a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent financial accounts. \nHe receives substantial credit for resolving all five of the delinquent debts in the SOR. \nThe timing of his actions is a consideration, as he did so after issuance of the SOR in \nApril 2019. But I have also considered that it probably took Applicant some time to get \nback on his feet financially once he resumed employment in a good-paying job in \nJanuary 2017. And the passing of his spouse in 2018 is another consideration. Given \nthe circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nApplicant has also made arrangements with the IRS to pay the amount owed in \nback taxes for multiple tax years. He has made the monthly payment since July 2019, \n\n \n6 \n \nand the installment agreement was formally approved in September 2019. The \nagreement calls for the monthly payment to be automatically deducted from his \nchecking account. Given his level of income, he has sufficient cash flow to adhere to the \nagreement going forward. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 \n20(g) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nApplicant presented a good but less than perfect case in mitigation, but, as in all \nhuman affairs, perfection is not the standard. A security clearance case is not a debt-\ncollection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt \nalleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement \nthat an applicant make payments on all the delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is \nthere a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \n \nHere, I am persuaded that Applicant has made and is making an honest effort to \nbe financially responsible and repay his creditors. There are clear indications that his \nfinancial problems are under control. The five delinquent debts were resolved to the \nsatisfaction of the various creditors, and he has a formal installment agreement with the \nIRS to address tax indebtedness. It is probable that he will continue to make the agreed \nupon monthly payments and resolve the back taxes. Taking everything into account, \nApplicant demonstrated good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness by persevering \nunder difficult circumstances. The financial considerations concern is mitigated.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information.

Based upon a review \nof the record as a whole, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted.  \n \nHistory of Case \n \nOn October 13, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in connection with the periodic reinvestigation of his \nsecurity clearance. On April 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n(Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), which came into effect June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant submitted his written Answer to the SOR on June 5, 2019. He admitted \nthe SOR allegations, with explanations, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on \nJuly 17, 2019. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 9, 2019, setting the hearing \nfor September 12, 2019. On that date, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 4 into evidence. Applicant and three witnesses testified, and his counsel \noffered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through G into evidence. All exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 20, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He is a 1979 high school graduate. He enlisted in the \nU.S. Navy in August 1980, and honorably retired from active duty as a submarine qualified \nchief petty officer (E-7) in September 2000. After a period working in a naval shipyard, he \nbegan his current employment with a defense contractor as a team lead, performing major \nship overhauls and repair projects, in March 2007. He has successfully held Secret and \nTop Secret clearances throughout this time. He and his wife married in 1985, and they \nhave four children. (GE 1; AE B; AE D; Tr. 48, 83-84, 91-93.) \n \n \n The facts that generated DoD CAF action in this case are simple and undisputed. \nAfter Applicant filed his latest e-QIP, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) pulled \na full data credit report on January 7, 2017. It showed three delinquent credit card \naccounts, all with the same major bank. Two of the accounts were in Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \nname, but showed that he was an authorized user on them. The third, with the smallest \nbalance of $5,276, was a joint account in both of their names. The total outstanding \nbalance on the three accounts was $33,958. The accounts had been open for between \n10 and 20 years, but each became delinquent in 2013. Applicant\u2019s wife mostly used her \ntwo accounts for her work-related travel and other expenses, and their joint account was \nused for general family needs. (GE 3; GE 4.)  \n \n \nThroughout their marriage, Applicant\u2019s wife primarily handled their family finances \non a day-to-day basis. This beneficial practice arose due to his frequent and lengthy work-\nrelated absences from home during and after his Navy career, and due to her \nresourcefulness and responsible management skills. During their time in the Navy, \nApplicant\u2019s wife started a home health management job, which allowed her to work from \ntheir home and to continue working as they frequently moved on military orders. She \ndeveloped this into a 25-year career, in which she rose to become vice president of sales \nand operations for several different national organizations. By 2008, Applicant and his \nwife were each earning around $115,000 to $125,000 per year. Then, due to no fault of \nher own, Applicant\u2019s wife was laid off during an executive downsizing and corporate \nreorganization caused by the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession. (Tr. 49-51.) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nAfter her 2008 job loss, Applicant\u2019s wife was unsuccessful in finding new \nemployment, so they reduced their expenditures to fit the almost 50% cut in family \nincome. This effort was successful until 2013, when expenses related to their children\u2019s \nincreasing education costs and other needs put an unmanageable strain on their budget. \nRecognizing this, Applicant\u2019s wife sought the assistance of a debt-resolution company. In \n2014, this firm successfully negotiated a settlement agreement with the bank to resolve \nher three SOR-listed credit card accounts for a total of $4,500. This sum was to be paid \nin three automatic debit installments between February and May of 2015. The first two of \nthese payments were executed successfully, but for some reason that remains \nundetermined, the third payment was never received by the bank. Applicant\u2019s wife never \nreceived notice from the bank or the debt-resolution company that the settlement \nagreement was not successfully completed, and considered the matter to be resolved. \n(Tr. 50-53.)  \n \n \nApplicant was first made aware of this potential problem during his September \n2018 personal subject interview with an OPM investigator. (GE 2.) He told his wife about \nthe reportedly delinquent debts, and she explained that they had been resolved through \nher 2015 agreement with the bank. He supplied that information to the investigator, but \nhe and his wife were unable to provide corroborating documentation. Applicant became \naware that the matter remained unresolved when he received the SOR from the DoD CAF \nin late May 2019. Further inquiry revealed that the bank had only received the first two of \nthe three scheduled automatic payments, but no one could explain what had happened \nto the third payment. Given his responsible management position supervising critical \nshipyard repairs, and the critical need to maintain his clearance to perform that work, \nApplicant explored every option to resolve this issue. In August 2019, Applicant\u2019s wife \nentered into direct settlement agreements with the bank to resolve all three of the \noutstanding SOR-listed accounts. When their pending efforts to refinance their home \nmortgage debt took too long, they used their \u201crainy-day\u201d savings to make electronic \npayments that fully resolved all three accounts with the bank. (AE A; Tr. 66-67, 70-72, 88-\n89.)  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife live frugally and responsibly. They have owned their home \nfor more than 20 years. In July 2019 they owed about $181,500 toward their first and \nsecond mortgage loans, which have always been paid as agreed. Their home is worth \nabout $390,000 and, as a result of having recently discovered these credit card debts, \nthey are close to finalizing a VA refinance and consolidation loan that will significantly \nreduce their current loan interest rates and monthly mortgage payments. As of the hearing \ndate, they had not decided whether it would be prudent to withdraw any equity principal \nwhen they refinance, but might do so to replenish the \u201crainy-day fund\u201d that they used to \nresolve the formerly delinquent credit card accounts, and possibly pay off other current \ncredit accounts bearing higher interest rates. The two car loans on their credit report were \nopened in 2005 and 2007, and were fully paid off on time. They have no other delinquent \naccounts, and provided budget documentation showing a substantial monthly remainder \nafter paying their living expenses and credit charges. There is no indication of any \npotential for future financial hardship. (AE A; Tr. 60-68, 71-74.)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nApplicant provided copies of his military and civilian performance evaluations, \ncommendations, awards, and qualifications, which document his sustained superior \nperformance in increasingly demanding duties. He also provided testimony from two \nwitnesses, and letters from five other associates, attesting to his excellent character, \nintegrity, and trustworthiness. His testimony was forthright, and his concern for \nsafeguarding national security interests was manifest. (AE B; AE C; AE D; AE E; AE F; \nAE G; Tr. 29-47.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, each guideline lists potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 requires that the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a \ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant and his wife encountered financial difficulties when she lost her job, and \nabout half of their combined family income, due to her former employer\u2019s reorganization \nduring the 2008 financial crisis. They managed to remain current on their bills, with frugal \nliving, until 2013. At that point his wife, who capably manages their finances, contracted \nwith a debt-resolution firm to settle three outstanding credit card accounts they could no \nlonger afford to pay as agreed. Unbeknownst to them at the time, however, the final \npayment under the agreed settlement plan was never received by the bank. The accounts \nwere discovered to remain delinquent by the DoD CAF when Applicant applied for the \nperiodic reinvestigation of his clearance. These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the \nresulting security concerns. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes three conditions that fully mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant was unaware of the three delinquent credit card accounts until his OPM \ninterview. This was not a result of irresponsibility, but rather from his well-placed trust in \nhis wife\u2019s sound management of their family finances. Two of the three accounts were \nhers, on which he was solely an authorized user. They dated from her time as a well-paid \nvice president of a national home-healthcare organization, and she used them until she \nwas laid off in a reorganization caused by the 2008 financial crisis. The third, and smallest, \naccount was a joint account used for family living expenses. This was a one-time \noccurrence, caused by forces beyond their control, and to which they reacted responsibly. \nSome five years later, when they could no longer manage to carry these debts, Applicant\u2019s \nwife negotiated a favorable resolution which failed due to no fault of theirs. After becoming \naware of this fact, they initiated and completed a new agreement with the bank to fully \nresolve the three accounts. Their current financial situation is fully solvent, and there is \nminimal risk of future financial stress. These actions establish complete mitigation of \nsecurity concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s formerly delinquent debts. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nhas demonstrated accountability for resolving the debts he and his wife were formerly \nunable to repay. They have now resolved the formerly delinquent debts. He demonstrated \nstrong character and has devoted most of his adult life to successful support of critical \nnational security objectives. Applicant provided persuasive evidence of sufficient income \nsecurity to ensure solvency in the future. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or \nduress is minimal. Overall, the evidence has eliminated any former doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He successfully met his burden to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:   \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The case was \nassigned to me on August 2, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 30, 2019, for a hearing on November 15, \n2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s two exhibits, (GE) 1 and \n2, were entered into evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE), which were \noriginally admitted without objection as AE A, have been divided into 16 separate \nexhibits marked as AE A through AE P. One hearing exhibit (HE) 1 (administrative \nnotice) was marked. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) and the record closed on \nDecember 3, 2019. \nAdministrative Notice \nI have taken administrative notice of certain relevant facts related to the \nRepublic of Korea. These facts come from source material published by the Department \nof State and Department of Justice. The facts are limited to matters of general \nknowledge and not subject to reasonable dispute. \nRulings on Procedure \nIn an early portion of the hearing, Applicant was advised that he could \nobject to the entire PSI (GE 2) and the exhibit would not be admitted into evidence. Or \nhe could call a recess and review the exhibit for inaccuracies then testify regarding \nmodifications he sought to make to the exhibit. Applicant chose to make minor \nmodifications in those areas that contained inaccuracies. GE 2 was entered into \nevidence. During the hearing, Applicant was given an opportunity to address changes \nhe wanted to make to the PSI. (Tr. 13-14, 50) \nFindings of Fact \nIn his May 2019 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR 1.a and 1.b and \ndenied SOR 1.c, with explanations. \nApplicant, 35 years old, was born in the United States (US). In August \n2007, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from an American university. \nFollowing a short period of unemployment, he worked six months for an investment \nbank as a financial services representative, but left after finding the position \nuninteresting. He was unemployed for a few months before working for a \ntelecommunications company for five months in 2009 until early 2010. He was \nunemployed for about three months before March 2010, when he began teaching in \nSouth Korea. After moving back to the US in February 2017, his South Korean wife \ngave birth to a daughter in August 2017. Applicant obtained a master\u2019s degree in \naccounting in May 2018. He has been working full time as a staff auditor for an \n2 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccounting firm since September 2018. (GE 1 at 13, 15-16, 20-24, 44; GE 2 at 5; Tr. 5-\n6) \nApplicant did not intentionally select South Korea to launch his teaching \ncareer in March 2010. He explained that he simply wanted to go to Asia, after studying \nabroad in one European country and working as an intern in another European country. \nShortly after he began teaching in March 2010, he met his South Korean wife who was \nwaitressing part time at a restaurant while attending undergraduate school. In October \n2011, they married in South Korea. Attending the wedding were Applicant\u2019s parents and \nhis wife\u2019s parents, and other family members. (GE 1 at 31; Tr. 31-35) \nSOR 1.a \u2013 In February 2012, while residing and teaching in South Korea, \nApplicant was introduced to the Royal Asiatic Society \u2013 Korean Branch (RAS), a non-\nprofit organization designed to inform non-Koreans about Korean culture. The \norganization has never been associated with any government, but has been legally \nregistered by the South Korean Foreign Registry since 2004. From September 2013 to \nFebruary 2017, Applicant participated voluntarily on the advisory board of the \norganization. His primary job responsibility was to increase exposure of the RAS to a \nyounger pool of English teachers from the United States, Canada, and the United \nKingdom (UK). After he resigned from the advisory board in February 2017, Applicant \nvoluntarily continued to help the president of RAS publish a monthly newsletter about \nevents planned by the organization. These events included lectures, music, and arts \nand crafts displays. Currently, Applicant has no connection with any activity of the RAS. \n(GE 1 at 15; GE 2 at 2; Tr. 22, 35-40; May 2019 answer at 3; AE J, K, L, M)  \nSOR 1.b \u2013 Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of South Korea. His mother-in-law is 58 years old and was a part-time music \nteacher. For the past 35 years, she has been a housewife. She has no connection to \nthe South Korean government or military. Applicant\u2019s mother and father-in-law own and \nlive at an apartment, but occasionally spend time at a rice farm they also own. (GE 1 at \n32-34; Tr. 24; May 2019 answer at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is 58 years old. He is a civil servant, having \nworked for 25 years as the head of academic affairs of the local office of the juvenile \ncrime prevention bureau. He advises juvenile delinquents and has worked in past with \nprosecutors on crimes committed by or against juveniles. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law has \nno connection to the South Korean military. (GE 1 at 32-34; Tr. 24, 45) \nApplicant and his wife contact their in-laws about once a month on social \nmedia platforms. The topics of discussion range from the health to the welfare of family \nmembers. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law came to the US in July 2017 to help Applicant\u2019s \nwife prepare for the birth of their daughter the next month. Applicant and his wife visited \ntheir in-laws in South Korea for about a month in May 2018. They have not returned \nsince. The in-laws know Applicant is applying for a security clearance and they know he \nis an accountant.

While living and working in the country \nbetween 2010 and February 2017, Applicant had limited association with his wife\u2019s \nfriends because he did not speak the South Korean language very well. His primary \ninteractions were with his coworkers at the public schools where he taught. After his \nwife immigrated to the US with Applicant in February 2017, she obtained her permanent \nresident card within six months. She has not found a job in the US, but intends to apply \nfor US citizenship in 2020. (Tr. 41-42) \nApplicant\u2019s wife has two brothers (unalleged in the SOR) who are citizens \nand residents of South Korea. One is a chef for a private employer, and the other is a \nbanker. They served in the South Korean military for two years as required by law. One \nor both of the brothers-in-law came to the US for sightseeing purposes in February 2018 \nand stayed in a hotel for about three days; they did not lodge with Applicant because he \nhad no extra space to accommodate them. He contacts them about once every six \nmonths on social media. They know he is applying for a security clearance, but they \nhave never asked about his job. He provides no financial support to his in-laws. The in-\nlaws may provide some type of present to Applicant\u2019s daughter. Applicant\u2019s mother, \nfather, and twin brothers are US citizens born in the United States. In the Analysis \nsection below, I intend to consider the unalleged contacts of Applicant to his wife and \nhis two brothers-in law along with the alleged items in the SOR. (Tr. 28-31, 46-47, 49) \nSOR 1.c \u2013 When Applicant certified his e-QIP in November 2017, the cited \nmonetary amounts were located in two South Korean bank accounts where Applicant\u2019s \nwife deposited her earnings from her job as a dental hygienist. Applicant explained that \nthe foreign exchange rates were too high to transfer the money at that time. Applicant \ntestified that his wife left the money in the foreign bank accounts because he was \nfunding all the cost of living expenses after their return to the US. She eventually \ntransferred the money to a US bank. Neither Applicant nor his wife have any open bank \naccounts in South Korea. The only potential financial interest is the farm his in-laws own \nand occasionally reside. Applicant is unaware of what the inheritance issues will be for \nthe farm. Applicant\u2019s US assets are in cash, stocks, or securities. The total cash value \nof those assets is $79,333. (GE 1 at 35-40; GE 2 at 4; Tr. 52-56; May 2019 answer to \nSOR; AE A, B, E, H, O, P) \nCharacter Evidence \nDuring his seven-year teaching career in South Korea from 2010 to \nFebruary 2017, Applicant earned an annual salary of about $31,000. He reported this \nforeign earned income annually to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the state tax \nauthority. Applicant provided extensive details about his foreign and domestic job \npositions in his November 2017 e-QIP. He readily sought the advice from his current \ncompany security officer for guidance before answering several foreign contact and \nforeign financial interest questions on the security form. Having carefully observed \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor at the hearing, I found his testimony credible and worthy of belief. \n(AE A at 4; AE A1; AE B; AE D) \n4 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 Republic of Korea \nSouth Korea is a democratic republic governed by a president and one \nlegislative body. The current president was elected in May 2017 in fair and free \nelections. Since 1950, the United States and South Korea have enjoyed close ties in \nfighting communism in North Korea and Vietnam. The United States has thousands of \nmilitary troops stationed in the country and conducts periodic joint-exercises with South \nKorea. In recent years, the President of the United States and the Supreme Leader of \nNorth Korea and have had meetings to improve relations between the two countries. \nThe President of South Korea has made diplomatic overtures to unify the two Koreas. \nSouth Korean espionage and collection activities have resulted in criminal \nprosecutions. In 1997, a US civilian employee pled guilty to passing classified \ninformation to a South Korean naval officer. In 2011, a US federal agency employee \npled guilty to exporting US information to South Korea without authorization. In July \n2013, an individual from a Middle Eastern country pled guilty to exporting helicopter \ncomponent parts from the United States to a Middle Eastern country, via South Korea. \nSouth Korea generally respects the human rights of its citizens. However, \nin 2018, conscientious objectors to military service were detained. Furthermore, some \ninstances of violence and mistreatment of South Korean soldiers were uncovered \ndespite efforts of the government human rights commission to curb such misbehavior. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . \n.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \n5 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern \nif they result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology; and  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest. \nContacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign country \ndo not automatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. As set forth \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a), the contacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation. Under AG \u00b6 7(b), connections are only disqualifying if they create a \npotential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s security duties and his desire to assist \nhis foreign family members. As the guideline indicates, the country in question must be \nconsidered. \nEven though the record contains no evidence that South Korean \ngovernment operatives, terrorists, or extremists have attempted to extract sensitive \n6 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation from or through Applicant or his foreign in-laws, there is a chance that \nforeign coercion could be exerted against or through him in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to his parents-in-law is sufficient to establish AG \u00b6 \n7(a). AG \u00b6 7(b) is applicable because Applicant\u2019s connections to his foreign family \nmembers create a potential conflict of interest between his obligation to protect \nclassified or sensitive information or technology and his desire to help that his family \nmembers by providing that information. AG \u00b6 7(f) no longer applies as Applicant has \nclosed all South Korean bank accounts and all of Applicant\u2019s assets are located in the \nUS. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is the only family member with a connection to the \nSouth Korean government. His job as the head of academic affairs of the juvenile crime \nprevention bureau presents a potential opportunity for a South Korean government \nofficial or intelligence operative to exert pressure through him to Applicant. AG \u00b6 8(a) is \nnot established. \nApplicant has \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the US.\u201d \nHe, his parents and brothers are US citizens. His two-year old daughter was born in the \nUS. He earned his undergraduate and master\u2019s degree in the US. He has lived in the \nUS for 28 years of his life. He has been a full-time staff auditor for a US accounting firm \nsince September 2018. In 2020, his wife intends to commence the naturalization \nprocess to become a US citizen. All of Applicant\u2019s financial interests are located in the \nUS. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n7 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s communication with his parents-in-law is once a month on social \nmedia. The last time he saw both in-laws face-to-face was in May 2018. Applicant\u2019s \ncommunication with his two brothers-in-law is twice a year. The last time he saw either \nof them was in February 2018. Security concerns under AG \u00b6 8(c) may be mitigated \nwhen the communication with foreign family members is so casual and infrequent that it \ndoes not create a risk of foreign influence. However, there is a rebuttable presumption \nthat contacts with a foreign family member are not casual. AG \u00b6 8 (c) does not apply to \neither his parents-in-law. Applicant\u2019s past involvement in RAS raises no current security \nconcerns because he has severed all connections to the organization. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the foreign influence guideline in the \ncontext of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant and his daughter are US citizens. His wife plans to become a US \ncitizen in 2020. Applicant obtained his undergraduate degree in 2007 and master\u2019s \ndegree in accounting in May 2018. Both degrees were earned from US universities. He \nhas been employed full time as a licensed CPA for a reputable US accounting firm. \nConsidering the evidence from an overall commonsense point of view, specifically his \nfavorable demeanor and honesty demonstrated at the hearing, Applicant has met his \nburden of mitigating the security concerns based on the foreign influence guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B):  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

On May 1, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DODCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective June 8, 2017.   \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 13, 2019. He answered the \nSOR (Answer) in writing on June 17, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) received the \nrequest soon thereafter. I received the case assignment on August 16, 2019. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on August 16, 2019, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on September 17, 2019. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 and 2, \nwhich were received into evidence over objection. (Transcript (TR) at page 11 line 13 to \n\n \n2 \n \n \npage 13 line 10.) Applicant testified, called one witness, and resubmitted Exhibits \n(AppXs) A through E, which were already appended to Applicant\u2019s Answer, and \nreceived into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \non September 26, 2019. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegation in \nSubparagraph 1.a. of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old, is married, and works for a defense contractor. (TR at \npage 15 line 18 to page 20 line 13.) It is unclear when Applicant was granted a security \nclearance, as he appears to deny ever having one in his e-QIP (GX 1 at page 35). \nHowever, he admits the allegation that he used marijuana \u201cwhile granted access to \nclassified information.\u201d Furthermore, in his e-QIP Applicant avers he has worked for \n\u201cFederal Contractor(s)\u201d since April of 2011. (GX 1 at pages 12~15.) \n \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement \n \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits he used marijuana about 20~25 times from about May \n2012 to about November of 2017, while granted access to classified information. (TR at \npage 16 lines 1~5, at page 20 line 14 to page 24 line 7, at page 29 line 3 to page 36 line \n20, and at page 37 line 1 to page 38 line 9.) Applicant has provided a signed statement \nof intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse in the future. (AppX \nE.) This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nAppellant smoked marijuana on 20~25 occasions, while granted access to \nclassified information. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are established.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \nThe Applicant used marijuana 20~25 times over a period of about five years, \nwhile entrusted with access to classified information. Although he has provided a signed \nstatement of intent regarding no future involvement or misuse, his numerous occasions \nof past usage cannot be overlooked. The Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nguideline is found against Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is very well respected in \nthe workplace. (AppXs C~D.) However, overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \narising from his drug involvement and substance abuse.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nRichard A.

His most recent \nalcohol-related offense occurred in 2016. He successfully completed an alcohol \ntreatment program and has established a pattern of modified consumption of alcohol. \nAlcohol consumption security concerns are mitigated. Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 19, 2018, \nseeking the continuation of a clearance required for his position with a federal \ncontractor. After reviewing the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \non June 17, 2019, alleging security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol consumption). \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 1, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \n \nDOHA assigned the case to me on November 27, 2019, and issued a notice of \nhearing on January 31, 2020, setting the hearing for February 28, 2020. At the hearing, \nthe Government offered three exhibits (GE 1 through 3). Applicant offered two exhibits \n\n \n2 \n \n \n(AE 1-2), and all exhibits were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 9, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is a 1987 high \nschool graduate, and has completed some college courses, but not enough for a \ndegree. He married his first wife in 1999 and divorced in 2003. He married his second \nwife in 2004 and divorced in 2018. He has no children.  \n \nApplicant has been working as a network analyst-technician for federal \ncontractors since 2005. He was hired by his current employer and security sponsor in \nOctober 2015. Applicant testified that he was first granted a secret clearance in 2006 \nwhile employed with a federal contractor and detailed to a federal agency. In 2012, his \nclearance was upgraded to top-secret and he has held it to present. He stated that, \nexcept for the allegations in the SOR, he has never had any other security issues or \nconcerns. \n \nIn his responses to Sections 22 (Police Record) and 24 (Use of Alcohol) of his \n2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed a history of alcohol-related offenses. The background \ninvestigation provided additional details about the security concerns alleged in the SOR. \n \nIn substance, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested and charged with \ndriving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in 1989, 2006, and 2016; arrested in \n2009 for an alcohol-related domestic violence offense; diagnosed with alcohol abuse in \n2016; and has continued to consume alcohol notwithstanding his diagnosis of alcohol \nabuse and recommendation that he abstain from alcohol consumption.  \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR 1.a \u2013 1.e, with \nsome clarifications. He denied the allegation that he continues to consume alcohol. \n(SOR 1.f) At his hearing, he admitted that while in counseling he was advised to remain \nabstinent. He was abstinent during his treatment periods, but after treatment, he \ncontinued to consume alcoholic beverages in moderation. Applicant repeatedly stated \nthat he was not aware of receiving an alcohol abuse diagnosis. His SOR admissions, \nand those at the hearing, are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough \nreview of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \n1. Applicant admitted that he was arrested and charged with DUI in December \n1989. He has no additional recollection of the offense or its disposition.  \n \n2. In January 2006, Applicant was charged with driving an all-terrain vehicle (ATV \n\u2013 four wheeler) while under the influence of alcohol. He explained that he was fixing the \nATV and drank about six or seven beers. He took the ATV for a ride on the side of the \nroad to charge its battery. He was stopped by a police officer and charged with DUI. \nThe charge was later downgraded to a misdemeanor. Applicant was adjudged probation \nbefore judgment in May 2006. He successfully completed the court-mandated alcohol \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncounseling program from June to September 2006, and two-year unsupervised \nprobation.  \n \nDuring a September 2006 interview with a government investigator, Applicant \nstated that he would consume three-to-four beers, two-to-three times a week. His future \nplans were to limit his alcohol consumption to a few beers at home, and no drinking and \ndriving. \n \n3. In December 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic \nviolence (second degree assault). He explained he discovered his wife was sending \nimproper pictures of herself to another man. He was upset, and took the laptop from \nher. At the same time, she grabbed the laptop to stop him from taking it, and during the \nstruggle, she cut herself and reported the incident to the police. He stated he had \nconsumed three-to-four beers before the incident, but was not intoxicated. Applicant \nand his wife reconciled. She failed to appear in court to testify against him, and the \ncharge was dismissed.  \n \n4. In April 2016, Applicant was stopped by a police officer, refused to take a \nbreathalyzer test, and was charged with DUI. The charge was downgraded to a \nmisdemeanor after Applicant agreed to serve 15 days of confinement. He pleaded guilty \nto the offense and was placed on unsupervised probation for three years (until August \n2019). (SOR 1.d; GE 2)  \n \n5. The court required Applicant to attend alcohol counseling. He successfully \nparticipated in the 12-week substance abuse treatment program between July and \nDecember 2016. (SOR 1.e; GE 3) The counseling services report (dated December 9, \n2016) states that Applicant was first evaluated in July 2016. His breathalyzer test was \nnegative for alcohol use and his urinalysis test was negative for illegal substance use. \nHe completed the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) and it was \u201cindicative of an \nalcohol problem.\u201d The Chemical Dependency Screening Test (CDST) suggested no \napparent problem with chemical substances. The report further stated that Applicant \nsuccessfully completed his treatment in December 2017, and that \u201che reports sincere \nmotivation for total abstinence from alcohol use in the future.\u201d (GE 3) \n \nThere is no record evidence to support the conclusion that Applicant was \ndiagnosed with \u201calcohol abuse\u201d (as alleged) or with an \u201calcohol use disorder\u201d as outlined \nin the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The counseling \nservices report states that the MAST test was \u201cindicative of an alcohol problem;\u201d \nhowever, the counselor failed to articulate a diagnosis. I find that the government\u2019s \nevidence is insufficient to establish that Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol abuse. \n \nApplicant was interviewed in July 2018 by a government investigator concerning \nhis 2016 DUI. Applicant told the investigator he believed the recurrence of a similar \nincident was unlikely because he was now consuming only a few beers at home.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n6. SOR 1.f alleged Applicant continues to consume alcohol, notwithstanding his \ndiagnosis, and a recommendation that he abstain from alcohol. Applicant admitted that \nhe continues to consume alcohol, but in moderation. Concerning the recommendation \nthat he abstain from alcohol, Applicant admitted he was required to remain abstinent \nwhile attending counseling-therapy, which he did. There is no evidence in the record file \nto establish that Applicant was counseled to remain abstinent as part of his aftercare \ntreatment. As stated above, I find that the government\u2019s evidence is insufficient to \nestablish that Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol abuse. \n \nI note that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 reorganization in January 2017. The \nbankruptcy court discharged his dischargeable debts in April 2018.  \n \nAt hearing, Applicant presented three favorable reference statements from a \nteam lead and two coworkers. The references consider Applicant to be highly skilled, \nknowledgeable, competent, dedicated to the mission, dependable, efficient, and \nreliable. He is considered to have contributed highly in the daily functions of the \nbusiness. He is a very reliable source in obtaining information, researching issues, and \nphysical relocations. Applicant has excellent rapport with other member of the team and \nhe willingly shares his experience with younger employees. He is also considered to be \ntrustworthy and a man of his word.  \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his alcohol-related misconduct. He understands \nthat he needs to control his alcohol consumption. He acknowledged that he made some \nmistakes in the past, and now is paying for them. Applicant stated that life is a learning \nexperience. He believes that he has learned the hard way, and he is trying to \nreestablish normalcy in his life. He promised to be more responsible in the future.  \n \nApplicant testified that he has been abstinent only while attending counseling or \ntreatment. After that, his plan has been to consume alcohol in moderation. In his \nresponse to May 2019 DOHA interrogatories and at hearing, he stated that he \nconsumes about five beers a week. He stated that he has not been arrested or involved \nin any alcohol-related misconduct after April 2016. Before the 2016 DUI, he was \nconsuming six beers every two days or every day, about five days a week (Tr. 38-40) \n \nApplicant testified that after his 2016 DUI, he reduced his alcohol consumption. \nHe currently consumes about three beers every two days, and may have none on some \ndays. He stated that he has further reduced his alcohol consumption over the past year \nbecause he is having medical issues, including high blood pressure, and he does not \nbelieve that consuming alcohol is helping him. He has been monitoring how much \nalcohol he consumes. He averred that he only consumes alcohol at home. He believes \nthat he has faced and resolved the pertinent issues in his life. He has been drinking \nmoderately after his 2016 DUI, he divorced in 2017, and filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nprotection to resolve his financial problems.  \n \nApplicant believes he has made lifestyle changes to stop him from consuming \nexcessive amounts of alcohol. He is now living with his mother and helping her with the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nmaintenance of her home. She provides him with the emotional support he needs. He \nbelieves that he has been working hard in his recovery. He is committed to consuming \nalcohol in moderation and has established healthy habits. Applicant is concerned about \nnot getting his clearance, losing his job, and not being able to provide financial support \nfor his mother. (Tr. 61-62) Applicant does not want to fail or let his mother down. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended. The case will be adjudicated under the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of alcohol abuse covering the period from December \n1989 through April 2016. His three DUI arrests (1989, 2006, and 2016), and another \nalcohol-related offense (domestic violence) demonstrate that he has consumed alcohol \nexcessively and to the point of impaired judgment. The record establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides for mitigating conditions that may be applicable to this case:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \n\n \n7 \n \n \nprogress in a treatment program; and the individual has successfully \ncompleted a treatment program along with any required aftercare, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent DUI offense occurred in April 2016, and there is no \nevidence of any subsequent alcohol-related misconduct. After the 2006 and 2016 DUIs, \nApplicant successfully participated in alcohol counseling-treatment programs. I \nconsidered that Applicant relapsed in April 2016, after participating in an alcohol \ncounseling program in 2006. However, he has eliminated some of the stresses in his life \nthat precipitated his drinking such as his marital problems (resolved through a divorce in \n2018), and his financial problems were resolved by the bankruptcy discharge. \n \n \nAfter the 2016 DUI, Applicant has made lifestyle changes to reduce his alcohol \nconsumption and prevent any further DUIs. He is now residing with his mother. She \nprovides him with the environment and support he needs to continue drinking in \nmoderation. Also, she depends on his help, and he does not want to fail or let her down. \nApplicant also noted that he now suffers from medical problems that are aggravated by \nhis alcohol consumption. He has curtailed his consumption of alcohol to prevent further \nhealth issues.  \n \nMoreover, Applicant loves his job. He is very concerned about his eligibility for a \nclearance and being able to continue working for his employer. I believe that it is \nunlikely that Applicant will engage in any future alcohol-related misconduct. He credibly \npromised to avoid any further alcohol-related incidents. More importantly, as a result of \nthe clearance process, he clearly understands that his eligibility for a clearance and his \njob depend on him continuing to drink alcohol in moderation.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s references consider him to be extremely knowledgeable, dependable, \ndedicated, reliable, punctual, trustworthy, and a great asset. He displayed leadership by \nmentoring and training new employees. I find that Applicant has demonstrated a \nsufficient pattern of modified behavior for me to conclude that the questionable \njudgment associated with his alcohol-related misconduct is behind him.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant, 50, has been working for federal contractors since 2005, and for his \nemployer since 2015. He has held a clearance since 2006. His character witnesses \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndescribed him as an excellent employee who is trustworthy, reliable, and dedicated to \nmission accomplishment. \n \nApplicant should have been more responsible consuming alcohol and obeying \nthe traffic laws. Notwithstanding, I believe that after 2016, he has demonstrated a \npattern of modified behavior and rehabilitation. Applicant is fully aware of the security \nconcerns raised by his alcohol consumption and related criminal behavior. He promised \nto consume alcohol in moderation and to obey the traffic laws to ensure that he \ncontinues to be eligible for a clearance. He understands that if he is involved in any \nadditional alcohol-related misconduct his clearance eligibility could be denied. The \nalcohol consumption security concerns are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

(Item 1.) The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, \n2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 28, 2020. He admitted all of the SOR \nallegations concerning his delinquent debts, and requested that his case be decided by \nan administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. On May 27, 2020, \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), containing 8 Items, was mailed to Applicant on June \n2, 2020, and received by him on June 10, 2020. The FORM notified Applicant that he \nhad an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM.  \n \n \nApplicant responded to the FORM on June 22, 2020. He did not object to Items 1 \nthrough 8. Applicant also submitted additional information in his FORM response, to \nwhich Department Counsel had no objection. DOHA assigned the case to me on July \n28. Items 1 through 8 are admitted into evidence. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM \n(Response) is also admitted.  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. (Item 3 at page 5.) He is married, following a pervious \ndivorce, with five children from both marriages. (Item 3 at pages 29~31, and 34~36.)  \nApplicant avers that both spouses \u201cmishandled\u201d the family finances. (Response at page \n1.)  \n \n \n1.a.~1.o Applicant admits 15 past-due debts totaling about $97,070. (Answer) \nThrough the auspices of a debt consolidation service (DCS), on June 10, 2020, \nApplicant began to address an unspecified $71,560 of these admitted debts. \n(Response) He is doing this by making bimonthly payments of $464 to the DCS. (Id.) \nThis leaves $25,510, or more than a quarter of his admitted past-due debts \nunanswered. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. These facts establish prima \nfacie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shifts the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAlthough Applicant can attribute his present financial difficulties, in part, to a prior \nmarriage; his financial difficulties continued with his second marriage, and there are not \nclear indications that his financial issues are under control. Applicant has yet to address \nover $25,000 of admitted past-due debt. The record does not establish mitigation of \nfinancial security concerns under the provisions of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through 20(d). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He has not met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through1.o: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 20, 2017. On \nMay 24, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 24, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On November 1, 2019, the Government sent Applicant \na complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 7. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on November 14, \n2019, and timely submitted his response, to which the Government did not object. Items \n\n \n2 \n \n1 and 2 are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 7 are admitted into evidence. \nApplicant\u2019s FORM response included documents that are admitted into evidence as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. The case was assigned to me on January 3, 2020. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 2), his \nSCA (Item 3), and the summary of his security clearance interview (SI) (Item 5). Item 5 \nwas not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that \nApplicant waived any objection to Item 5. The Government included in the FORM a \nprominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of Item 5 on \nthe ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he did not \nraise any objection to Item 5 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond to \nthe FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item 5 \ncould be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant did not raise any objections in \nhis FORM response or otherwise. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 32, has never married nor has any children. He has cohabited \nwith his girlfriend since 2014. Applicant\u2019s education history was not specified in the \nrecord. This is his first application for a security clearance. He is no longer employed by \nthe same defense contractor who was sponsoring his security clearance application in \nJuly 2017. However, there is no information in the record as to when or why that \nemployment ended or when he began working for his current employer. (Item 2 at 4; \nItem 4 at 29-30) \n \nIn his July 2017 SCA, Applicant reported seven delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $19,424, including a $5,500 judgment for a defaulted loan (unalleged), a \n$9,310 auto loan for vehicle that had been repossessed (unalleged), a $670 credit-card \naccount (unalleged), a $670 bank account (unalleged), a $1,544 medical account (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b), a $1,182 medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and a $543 satellite television account \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). He also reported that he failed to file his federal income tax returns or pay \nhis federal income taxes for tax years 2014 and 2016. Only the failure to file was \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He explained that he had not yet filed his returns because he was \nunable to locate documents that he apparently believed were necessary for him to file. \nAt that time, he did not know the amount of taxes, if any, that he owed. He attributed his \ndelinquent debts to a period of unemployment that began in approximately January \n2015. He asserted that he planned to file his returns and pay his taxes by the end of \n2017, and pay his delinquent debts within the next year or two years. (Item 3 at 36-44) \n \nApplicant\u2019s August 2017 credit report confirmed the delinquent status of the auto \nloan, the credit-card account, and the three debts alleged in the SOR. His November \n2018 credit report confirmed the delinquent status of the $1,544 medical debt and that \nthe auto loan had been paid. The reports showed that the debt underlying the judgment \nwas a $5,500 unsecured loan account opened in 2014. Other record information \nrevealed that the judgment for the defaulted loan was entered in August 2016 for $6,203 \n\n \n3 \n \nplus interest. The reports confirm that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d were \nsent to collections in November 2015, April 2016, and December 2016, respectively. \n(Items 6; Item 4 at 11-12) \n \nDuring his August 2018 SI, Applicant acknowledged that he had not yet filed his \nreturns or paid his taxes for tax years 2014 and 2016. He asserted that he planned to \ndo so before the end of 2018. He claimed that he had paid or satisfied all of the \ndelinquent accounts he reported on his SCA except for the judgment. He averred that \nthe judgment was being collected via a bi-weekly garnishment of 25% of his wages, \nwhich was then approximately $480. Although he recalled that it started in \napproximately July 2018, other record evidence established that the garnishment \nstarted in September 2018. He acknowledged that he had not received any financial \ncounseling, but asserted that his financial situation was good, that he was willing and \nable to repay all of his debts, and that he was living within his means. He stated that it \nwas highly unlikely that he would experience financial problems in the future. (Item 4 at \n11-12; Item 5 at 2-3) \n \nIn his March 2019 responses to interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged that he \nhad not yet paid or otherwise resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d, \ncontrary to the claim he made during his SI. He averred that he could not afford to pay \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c until after his garnishment ended. He believed \nthat the satellite-television debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d had been resolved when he \nreturned equipment to his creditor and promised to investigate the matter and settle the \ndebt after the garnishment ended. As of January 2019, the wage garnishments had \nreduced the balance of his judgment debt to $1,313, and he anticipated that it would be \nfully paid by June 2019. He provided proof that he paid the $670 credit-card debt in April \n2018. The status of his $670 bank account debt was not addressed. (Item 4 at 2-4, 9, \n11-12) \n \nIn his March 2019 responses to interrogatories, Applicant did not provide a \nresponse to the questions about the status of his tax return filings and tax payments, but \nhe did provide IRS tax records confirming that he had not yet filed his returns for tax \nyears 2014 and 2016. Those records did not address what, if any, taxes were owed for \nthose years. He timely filed his 2015 and 2017 returns and received refunds of $1,361 \nin February 2016 and $864 in February 2018. (Item 4 at 2, 5, 6, 15, 19, 23, 27) \n \nIn his June 24, 2019 SOR response, Applicant acknowledged that his returns for \ntax years 2014 and 2016 remained unfiled. He asserted that he tried to file them on his \nown, but realized that he needs professional help to do so. He claimed that the returns \nwould be filed \u201csoon.\u201d He also admitted that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d \nhad not yet been resolved because \u201cof all the other debt that I have paid off in the past \nyear.\u201d He did not provide any specific information about the referenced \u201cother debt.\u201d He \nalso stated that \u201cI was unaware that I had a crunch in time to get all paid and settled.\u201d \nHe averred that he planned to get a personal loan to pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b through 1.d and any taxes that he owed \u201cby the end of June [2019], beginning of \nJuly [2019].\u201d (Item 2) \n \n\n \n4 \n \nIn his December 2019 FORM response, Applicant proffered that he filed his tax \nreturns and paid the taxes owed for tax years 2014 and 2016, and paid the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. He provided proof of the payment for the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, but not for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He promised to pay the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c \u201cafter the holidays.\u201d He did not provide proof of his tax-return \nfilings. While he provided a document purporting to prove the tax payments, it did not \nshow information sufficient to establish that fact. He stated that \u201cif needed, I will request \nthe IRS forms for proof.\u201d He also stated \u201cI really hope I get this clearance so I keep my \njob but if not it will be a life lesson.\u201d He attributed the further delay in addressing the \nSOR concerns to his 36-year-old brother\u2019s passing in May 2019 and his unspecified \nsupport of his mother who retired sometime after May 2019. (AE A, B) \n \nApplicant has been unemployed three times since January 2015: 1) January \n2015 through February 2015, which occurred after he left an employer due to a dispute \nover his pay rate; 2) October 2015 through April 2016, which occurred after he left \nanother employer due to what he described as \u201cunsatisfactory management;\u201d and 3) \nMarch 2017 through July 2017, which occurred after his contract with an employer of 11 \nmonths ended. (Item 3 at 10-17; Item 5 at 1) \n \nApplicant\u2019s December 2018 and January 2019 paychecks revealed two loans \nthat were being repaid to his employer, which were not otherwise addressed in the \nrecord. The paychecks also showed that the bi-weekly garnishment had been reduced \nto $435 in December and $358 in January. As of January 2019, Applicant estimated \nthat his monthly take-home pay was $1,741 (after deductions including the loan \nrepayments and garnishment), with monthly expenses totaling $1,650, leaving a net \nremainder of $91. Based on the two paychecks that he provided, his pay may fluctuate \nwith overtime. The record does not contain any information concerning Applicant\u2019s \nincome and expense history from the period immediately preceding January 2015 \nthrough January 2019, besides the garnishment. (Item 4 at 8, 11, 29, 30) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2)) \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n6 \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012))  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his credit reports establish the following disqualifying \nconditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required). \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are fully established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \nApplicant resolved the unalleged $9,310 auto loan and $670 credit-card debts \nwell before the issuance of the SOR. On the other hand, Applicant waited until after he \nwas prompted by the SOR to pay the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. The fact that the \ncreditor of Applicant\u2019s 2014 loan had to secure a judgment and wage garnishment to \nrecover the debt further fails to exemplify \u201cgood-faith effort.\u201d Because he did not submit \nany documentary proof, I cannot conclude that he paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nEven if I were to accept, without proof, that he filed his tax returns sometime after he \nresponded to the SOR, his repeated failure to timely file his 2014 and 2016 tax returns \nover an extended period of time did not demonstrate responsible action. While Applicant \nproffered some circumstances that were beyond his control, he did not establish that the \n\n \n7 \n \nSOR concerns largely resulted from those circumstances or that he acted responsibly to \naddress his delinquent debts and tax returns. \n \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Applicant\u2019s failure to resolve his SOR debts, \nwithout more, may not have been sufficiently disqualifying to deny him security \nclearance eligibility in light of the amount and nature of the debts. However, Applicant \nfailed to establish justifiable reasons for failing to timely file his tax returns. His lack of \nresponsible action to address his SOR debts, together with the persistent \nprocrastination and avoidance surrounding his tax obligations, underscore a pattern of \nbehavior towards his financial commitments and responsibilities that is troubling in the \ncontext of evaluating security worthiness. Applicant failed to follow through on any of the \npromises he made to file his delinquent returns and determine his tax liability for tax \nyears 2014 and 2016 until after being prompted by the SOR. And, even then, he did not \nprovide sufficient proof to establish AG \u00b6 20(g).  \n \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing \nincome tax returns when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. (See ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015)). \u201cFailure to file income tax returns \nsuggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established \ngovernment rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is \nessential for protecting classified information.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002)). I am left with doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Thus, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F \nconcerns at this time. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \n\n \n8 \n \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his failure to timely file federal income tax returns and pay \ndelinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

A Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nwas issued under Guideline F, financial considerations, due to three years of then unfiled \nstate and Federal income tax returns and three other delinquent accounts. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 14, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, financial considerations, under which it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DoD CAF \nacted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \n\n \n2 \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information \n(AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn July 6, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nThe SOR was amended to allege that the account in SOR 1.d went from being listed as \na \u201ccollection\u201d account to a \u201ccharged-off\u201d account. On August 16, 2019, Applicant \nresponded to the amended SOR allegation, admitting the account. On December 11, \n2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing that was conducted on \nJanuary 15, 2020. \n \nFour Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 4) and three Applicant exhibits (Ex. A \u2013 C) were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The record was held open following the hearing \nto allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. On March 3, 2020, additional \ndocuments were received and admitted into evidence without objection as Ex. D and E. \nApplicant testified at the hearing, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on January 29, \n2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR he admitted his tax filings had been delayed and \nhis Federal student loan (NAVIENT) had been charged off. He denied two collection \naccounts, but later admitted that the debt in SOR 1.d had been charged off. (SOR \nResponses) After a thorough review of the testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old electrician who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince July 2018 and seeks to obtain a security clearance. (Ex. 2, Tr. 16) In April 2013, \nApplicant married. He and his spouse have two children ages 1 and 6. (Ex. 1, Tr. 18) He \nhas not served in the military. (Tr. 17) His wife is an entrepreneur and has done web \ndesign for multiple companies. (Tr. 20) His salary last year was $53,000, and his salary \nis currently $67,000 annually. (Tr. 23, 56) Last year he received a three-percent raise \nbased on his performance. In August 2020, at his two-year point with his employer, he \nanticipates his annual salary will increase to $85,000. (Tr. 24) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife started a digital company, which she still owns, and opened a juice \nbar. (Tr. 20) The juice bar has not been operating for the past six months. (Tr. 31) Sales \nstopped in July 2019. (Tr. 34) She is attempting to sell the brick and mortar brewery \nspace. (Tr. 30) His wife is not working as much as she had previously done. (Tr. 23) \n \nApplicant was a joint owner on the business. He could not file his individual taxes \nuntil the business taxes were filed. (Tr. 27) His wife, who handled their tax matters, \nneeded an accountant to prepare the business returns. Applicant\u2019s Federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 went unfiled as she searched for \nan accountant. (Tr. 20) It took four years before they could locate an accountant. In June \n2018, his wife hired an accountant. (Tr. 32) During that time Applicant and his wife moved \nfrom the northeastern United States, to their current location. His wife handled all matters \n\n \n3 \nrelated to their taxes. (Tr. 33) In August 2018, Applicant sold his home in the northeast. \n(Tr. 20) After the sale, they had sufficient funds to pay an accountant. (Tr. 20) With the \nfunds from the home sale, Applicant paid the accountant\u2019s fee, paid their business taxes, \nmade past-due payments of $6,000 on his student loans, and had sufficient funds \nremaining to relocate to their new location. (Tr. 20, 22) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 26, 2018 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), he admitted he had not filed his state or Federal income tax returns \nfor tax year 2015, 2016, and 2017. He stated family issues prevented him from filing his \nreturns and also that he had hired an accountant to help him file his tax returns. (Ex. 1, \nTr. 28) In 2015, his mother had been injured at work. (Tr. 29) His mother\u2019s injury distracted \nhim from giving priority to his tax matters. \n \nApplicant had two student loan obligations. One was a charged-off private student \nloan (SOR 1.d) and the other was a Federal student loan (SOR 1.b). In his e-QIP, he \nadmitted owing $25,000 in student loans debts (SOR 1.b). The loans were obtained \nstarting in November 2003, when he started attending college. The loans became past \ndue when he had been unable to obtain a job that paid sufficient income to pay his student \nloans. (Ex. 1) At the time, he was making $410 a week as an electrician. (Tr. 29) As of \nhis person subject interview with an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), Applicant was attempting to locate the current holder of the private \nstudent loan so that he could contact the correct agency.  \n \nThe SOR lists a $25,083 collection debt (SOR 1.d). The debt had apparently been \ncharged off. Department Counsel stated the collection debt and the charged-off debt were \nthe same debt. (Tr. 11) This debt was a private student loan. In May 2019, the creditor \ncancelled the debt and issued an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-C form. The \namount of debt discharged was $19,638. (Ex. E) \n \nApplicant\u2019s Federal student loans (SOR 1.b) had become delinquent because he \nwas working in a position that provided insufficient income to make his monthly loan \npayments. (Ex. 2, Tr. 7) He now has a better job and lives in a lower cost of living area, \nhe is able to pay his student loans. (Ex. 2) In August 2018, after selling his previous \nresidence, he used $6,000 from the sale to bring his student loans current. (Ex. 2) In \nAugust 2018, he started making monthly payments on his student loans by automatic \nwithdrawal. (Tr. 41) Since August 2018, he has made timely payments of $675 monthly. \n(Ex. B, Tr. 40 - 42) His Federal student loans are currently in forbearance, but he \ncontinues to make his monthly payments. (Tr. 22) Applicant\u2019s January 2020 credit report \nlists these loans as simply \u201copen.\u201d (Ex. C) Some of the loans had previously been past \ndue, but none of the loans were delinquent or past due since August 2018. (Ex. C)  \n \nIn November 2018, when Applicant was interviewed by the OPM, he indicated his \nmother had been injured on the job in 2015, and he was helping his mother get to her \nmedical appointments and helping her with legal matters related to her injury. (Ex. 2) He \ngave priority to assisting his mother and failed to file his tax returns for 2015. He filed \nextensions of the tax filing deadline for tax years 2016 and 2017, but did not file his returns \nduring the extension period. (Ex. 2) \n\n \n4 \nApplicant\u2019s 2015 Federal tax return was due in April 2016. The return was filed on \nApril 7, 2019. He was issued a refund of $481. (Ex. A, SOR Response, Tr. 6) His 2016 \nFederal tax return was due in April 2017, but was also filed on April 7, 2019. He was \nissued a $1,267 refund. (Ex. A, Tr. 6) His 2017 Federal tax return was due in April 2018, \nbut was not filed until July 1, 2019. He was issued a $2,653 refund. (Ex. A, SOR \nResponse, Tr. 6) For tax year 2018 he received a $2,080 refund and for tax year 2014, \nhe received a refund of $1,165. (Ex. A). These two tax years are not listed as a concern \nin the SOR, but are included to show his returns have been filed and refunds issued. In \n2019, once the business taxes had been filed, he filed his state and Federal tax returns \nfor 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. (Tr. 28, 31) He paid $10,000 in past-due state taxes. (Tr. \n51) The current balance of his state taxes for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 is zero. \n(Ex. D) His state tax returns and all of his Federal tax returns in question, except for his \ntax return for tax year 2017, were filed before the SOR was issued. Although his 2017 \nreturns were in the process of being prepared by their accountant, they were filed two \nweeks after the date of the SOR. (Ex. A) \n \nThe SOR lists a $135 collection account (SOR 1.c). The debt was for cable \nequipment, which Applicant asserts he returned the equipment and paid the amount \nowed. The debt does not appear on his current credit report. (Ex. C) He failed to obtain a \nreceipt when he returned the equipment. (Tr. 22) \n \nOn the 5th day of each month, Applicant and his wife address their bills. (Tr. 37) \nThey make sure their monthly $1,298 mortgage payment, their utility bills, and their loan \npayments for their two vehicles are made. (Tr. 38) Their vehicle payments and automobile \ninsurance are paid through an automatic deduction. Applicant commutes 120 miles daily \nto work, and was paying $150 per week for fuel, so he purchased a new vehicle to lower \nhis transportation expenses. (Tr. 47) He is living within his means and satisfying his \nfinancial obligations. He has approximately $8,000 in his company\u2019s 401(k) retirement \nfund. (Tr. 54) He has done some financial research to learn more about credit and \nfinances. (Tr. 55) Applicant\u2019s January 2020 credit report lists his credit score as 686, \nwhich is considered \u201cgood.\u201d (Ex. C) The report lists no past-due or collection accounts. \n(Ex. C) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing \n\n \n5 \nof a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \n\n \n6 \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nApplicant was past due on his student loans and failed to timely file his Federal \nand state income tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. AG \u00b6 19 includes three \ndisqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in \nthis case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d \nand \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d In ISCR Case No. \n08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \nThe record having established disqualifying conditions, additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions is required. Applicant has the burden of \nestablishing that matters in mitigation apply. Five financial considerations mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n\n \n7 \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that he \nhas paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). The Appeal Board stated in ISCR \nCase No. 17-00263 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan \nfor debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences \na serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d \n \nSome of the Applicant\u2019s student loans had previously been past due. The loans \nbecame delinquent because he was working in a position that provided insufficient funds \nto make his monthly loan payments. He now has a better job, lives in a lower cost of living \narea, and is able to make his student loans payments. In August 2018, he sold his home \nand brought his Federal student loans current. He currently makes his monthly student \nloan payments by automatic withdrawal even though the Federal student loans are in \nforbearance. His January 2020 credit report lists his loans as simply \u201copen\u201d and shows \nno past-due amounts since August 2018. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to his Federal student loans \nsince he has reached a repayment agreement and has been in compliance with that \nagreement since August 2018.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s other student loan (SOR 1.d) was a private student loan. In May 2019, \nthe creditor cancelled the debt and an IRS Form 1099-C form was issued. Applicant is no \nlonger liable for this debt.  \n \nApplicant was a joint owner with his spouse on a business. He was unable to file \nhis individual taxes until the business taxes were filed. It took four years before an \naccountant could be located. In June 2018, his wife hired an accountant. Following the \nsale of his home, there was sufficient income to pay for the accountant and to pay the \npast-due state income tax. The accountant filed Applicant\u2019s Federal income tax returns, \nand he received refunds for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. In 2015, his mother had \nbeen injured at work. These family issues were also a factor in him not filing timely tax \nreturns. All his Federal and state income tax returns have now been filed and any taxes \ndue have been paid. He filed his delinquent income tax returns for tax years 2015 and \n2016 before he received the SOR, which shows his good faith in rectifying his tax issues. \nHis 2017 tax returns were being prepared by the accountant and filed two weeks after the \ndate of the SOR, showing he was acting to address his tax issues prior to the receipt of \nthe SOR.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to his past-due Federal and state tax filings, which have now \nbeen filed and all tax paid. AG \u00b6 20(g) would have limited applicability because Applicant \n\n \n8 \nnever entered into a repayment arrangement with the appropriate tax authority since he \nfiled his delinquent tax returns, received refunds of his Federal taxes, and paid his past-\ndue state taxes. \n \nThe SOR lists a $135 collection account (SOR 1.c) for cable equipment that was \nnot timely returned. Applicant asserts he paid the debt and failed to obtain a receipt when \nhe returned the equipment. This small debt, even if unpaid, is insufficiently large enough \nto be of security significance. He disputed this debt, and it does not appear on his current \ncredit report. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to this small debt. \n \nApplicant has done some financial research to learn more about credit and \nfinances. On the 5th day of each month Applicant and his wife sit down and address their \nbills. They are current on their mortgage, car payments, and utilities. He has \napproximately $8,000 in his company\u2019s 401(k) retirement fund. His January 2020 credit \nreport lists his credit score as 686, which is considered \u201cgood,\u201d and lists no past-due or \ncollection accounts. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies. There are clear indications that his financial \nproblems are being resolved and are under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies in that the tax returns are filed and no money is owed. The \nstudent loan is current. Neither taxes nor debts are ongoing. There is little likelihood of \nrecurrence. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application because his student loans went unpaid \nbecause he had limited income to pay those loans. Additionally, his ability to file his \nindividual income tax was due to his inability to locate an accountant willing to complete \ntheir business returns and his mother injury was also a factor in him not filing timely tax \nreturns. \n \nApplicant needs to show that he has a plan to resolve his debts and that he has \ntaken significant steps to implement his plan, which he has done. The financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. The comments under Guideline F are incorporated in the whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s lack of adequate income to pay the debt resulted in his default of the \nprivate student loans rather that an unwillingness to pay the debt. This debt can no longer \nbe a source of financial pressure for him because it has been forgiven. The Federal \nstudent loan has been current since August 2018. Between his mother\u2019s injury and finding \nan accountant to address his and his spouse\u2019s business tax returns, he was late on filing \nhis individual tax returns. His Federal and state tax returns have now been filed and no \nFederal or state tax is currently owed. His financial issues have been adequately \naddressed to whether they no longer present an unacceptable security risk.  \n \nThe law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, have \nbeen carefully applied to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid, it is whether \nApplicant\u2019s financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(c)) A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about his eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that Applicant owes two delinquent credit card debts totaling $29,107 (SOR 1.a, 1.b). He admitted both allegations with explanations.

However, considering the lack of \ncredible evidence of financial counseling and strong financial practices, Applicant has \nfailed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the lingering security concerns arising \nfrom the guideline for financial considerations. Eligibility for security clearance access is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 26, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. On April 23, 2018, he provided an interview (PSI) to an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). After reviewing the \nresults of a security background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) could \nnot make the affirmative findings required to grant a security clearance, and issued to \n\n \n  2 \n \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 6, 2019, detailing security \nconcerns under financial considerations (Guideline F). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on May 31, 2019. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 27, 2019, for a \nhearing on October 1, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s \nfour exhibits (GE) 1-5 and Applicant\u2019s one exhibit (AE) A was entered into evidence \nwithout objection. The exhibit has been divided into three exhibits (AE A-C). Applicant\u2019s \npost-hearing submission (AE D) was received on October 8, 2019. Department Counsel \ninterposed no objection. AE D was entered into evidence. The record in this case closed \non October 17, 2019, when DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes two delinquent credit card debts totaling \n$29,107 (SOR 1.a, 1.b). He admitted both allegations with explanations. His original \nintention was to let both credit card accounts remain in default during the running of the \nstate statute of limitations. After the statute expired, the accounts would be removed \nfrom his credit report and become uncollectible. When Applicant received the SOR in \nMay 2019, he took action to pay back the debts. (May 2019 answer to SOR) \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. In May 1999, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \njournalism. In the same month and year, he began serving on active duty in the United \nState Army (USA). He received an honorable discharge in September 2004. He has \nowned his own home since 2007. He married in 2011 and has a five-year-old daughter. \nHe has had a security clearance since 1994. (GE 1 at 9-10, 25 44; GE 2 at 7; Tr. 9) \n \n \nBetween 2004 and 2007, Applicant was working in security-related intelligence \npositions. Since 2007, he has held positions related to information technology (IT). In \nhis current job that he began in March 2019, he manages a website for a federal \ngovernment agency. (GE 1 at 12- 22; May 2019 answer to SOR; AE C; Tr. 8-9) \n \n \nBefore Applicant\u2019s current employment, he was unemployed in February 2019, \nafter working in a 1099 temporary position from November 2018 to February 2019. The \nunemployment occurred when the temporary contract ended. (GE 1 at 12- 22; May \n2019 answer to SOR; AE C; Tr. 8-9) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment between June and July 2017 was due to leaving his \nprevious job (January to June 2017) by mutual agreement after receiving a notice of \nunsatisfactory performance. Applicant was not completely qualified for his job and his \nclient was difficult to work for. During the early part of this employment, Applicant took \n\n \n  3 \n \ntwo recreational trips out of the United States. Each trip lasted up to five days. (GE 1 at \n12-22, 37-40; GE 2 at 4-5; May 2019 answer to SOR) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment from September 2014 to March 2015 occurred when \nhis previous employment contract ended. In his previous job, a 1099 position, he was \nemployed from August 2013 to September 2014. In March 2014, Applicant took a \nrecreational trip out of the United States. The trip lasted up to five days. (GE 1 at 12- 22, \n37-40; May 2019 answer to SOR; AE C; AE D at 9-10; Tr. 8-9) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment from April to August 2013 was due to his \nunanticipated release from a contract after working for an employer from May 2012 to \nApril 2013. His supervisor was asking him to do work that he did not know how to do, \nand the supervisor could not find Applicant another suitable position. In September \n2012, Applicant took a recreational trip out of the United States. The trip lasted up to \nfive days. (GE 1 at 12- 22, 37-40; May 2019 answer to SOR; AE C; Tr. 8-9) \n \n \nSOR 1.a and 1.b \u2013 These two accounts are credit cards that Applicant opened in \n2004. He used the cards to purchase items for his house and child. Applicant was \naware that both credit cards became delinquent by January 2014 because he could not \nmaintain the payments. The collection agency contacted him on a weekly basis for \npayment until the middle of 2016 when they stopped. (GE 2 at 8; GE 3 at 2) \n \n \n \nApplicant informed the OPM investigator in his April 2018 PSI that the two credit \ncard debts (SOR 1.a, 1.b) became delinquent during his unemployment in December \n2013 and January 2014. I find the OPM investigator misunderstood him because when \nApplicant discussed his unemployment in an earlier part of the PSI, he did not mention \nthat he was unemployed in December 2013 or January 2014. His September 2017 e-\nQIP, his May 2019 answer to the SOR, and his resume indicate that he was working as \na 1099 employee for a medical health agency between August 2013 and September \n2014. I find that Applicant was referring generally to the overall negative impact that the \noccasional unemployment was having on his bill-paying ability. (GE 1 at 16; GE 2 at 8-\n9; AE C at 2)  \n \n \nRegarding his intentions of avoiding similar financial problems in the future, \nApplicant indicated in his April 2018 PSI that he intended to repay all his debts, but was \nunable to state when. He planned on \u201cspending less and saving more.\u201d During the \nperiod after his April 2018 PSI, and before he filed his May 2019 answer to the SOR, \nApplicant changed his mind and decided not to repay the listed debts, opting to wait on \nthe state statute of limitations to run so that the debts would be removed from his credit \nreport. In his answer to the SOR, he decided to address the two debts. At the October \n2019 hearing, Applicant testified that his plan was \u201cto pay off all debts and aggressively \nstart saving.\u201d (GE 2 at 9; Tr. 35; May 2019 answer to SOR) \n \n \nAttached to his May 2019 answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that he \nreceived financial advice from his facility security officer (FSO) and a financial advisor \n\n \n  4 \n \nabout how to address the two listed debts. Based on that advice, Applicant contacted \nthe creditor in SOR 1.a and 1.b between May 16 and May 21, 2019, and negotiated a \nsettlement of each debt and corresponding payment plans. The combined settlement \namount is $8,592. This was the first documented time that Applicant contacted the \ncreditor to discuss settlement even though he knew the delinquent status of the debts \nsince at least 2014. He has made regular monthly payments from June through \nSeptember 2019. Both debts are scheduled to be paid off by May 2020. (May 2019 \nanswer to SOR; AE A; AE D at 15-20) \n \n \nThe financial adviser provided recommendations on how Applicant could repair \nhis credit. No further information was provided. Applicant has had no additional financial \ncounseling other than the information he supplied in his answer to the SOR in May \n2019. He does not utilize a written budget in managing his finances. Instead, Applicant \nkeeps a mental budget because he knows what the monthly expenses will be. He \nretains $200 for personal expenses out of his bi-monthly paychecks for unforeseen \nexpenses. Based on the figures Applicant provided, his take home pay is about $7,000 \na month and his expenses, including payments to the two creditors and the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS), amount to $5,150, leaving a discretionary monthly remainder of \n$1,850. However, Applicant believed his monthly remainder was $500 to $600. He has \n$2,000 in his checking account and $1,500 in his savings account. (May 2019 answer to \nthe SOR at 3-4; Tr. 25-31, 32, 36) \n \n \nThough unalleged in the SOR, the Government asked Applicant whether he \nowed federal or state taxes. He replied that he owes federal taxes of at least $18,000. \nHe explained that the delinquent taxes occurred because he did not report his taxable \nincome as a 1099 employee in 2013 and 2014. Even though he was employed in the \nposition for more than a year, and was 38 years old during this employment, he claimed \nthat he did not know the quarterly tax filing requirements for a 1099 employee. In \ndocumentation prepared by the IRS, dated October 3, 2019, Applicant owes \napproximately $4,583 for federal tax year 2014. He contended that regular monthly \npayments of $300 since 2014 reduced the original amount of $19,714 to $4,583. His \ndocumentation reflects that he has been paying the tax debt since October 2018. \nApplicant could have presented his bank records to show proof of payment to the IRS \nduring all or part of the period before October 2018. Applicant paid the corresponding, \ndelinquent state taxes due for 2013 and 2014, in periodic payments over an eight-month \nperiod ending in December 2014. (GE 2 at 7; AE D at 2-3, 5-8; Tr. 36-38) \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2018 W-2 Form with an erroneous notation that he was \nexempt from federal taxes for the year. As a result, he owes additional federal taxes of \n$14,488 for federal tax year 2018. The combined total of delinquent federal taxes for \nfederal tax years 2014 and 2018 is $19,079. In May 2019, his payments were increased \nto $500 a month to account for the additional delinquent taxes owed for tax year 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s IRS tax issues will be addressed in the discussion under the whole-person \nconcept. (AE D at 2-3, 5-8; Tr. 36-38)  \n \n\n \n  5 \n \n \nApplicant provided no character evidence regarding his performance on the job \nor his reputation in the community where he lives.  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b619 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n\n \n  6 \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThe Government\u2019s 2018 and 2019 credit reports, Applicant\u2019s May 2019 answer to \nthe SOR, and the record establish the Government\u2019s case under the guideline for \nfinancial considerations. Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations. \nFor a period of time before he provided his May 2019 answer to the SOR, Applicant \nintended to rely on the running of the state statute of limitations to have the two listed \ndebts removed from his credit report. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(b) applies \nto the period when Applicant initially decided to let the SOR debts remain in default \nunder the state statute of limitations until the debts were removed from his credit report. \n \nThe pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Though there are only two delinquent debts listed in \nthe SOR, the amount of combined debt is sizeable. While Applicant acknowledged the \ntwo debts in his September 2017 e-QIP, and indicated he would resolve them in his \nApril 2018 PSI, he took no documented action until after he received the SOR in May \n2019 to negotiate and settle the indebtedness. Applicant made no documented effort to \ncontact and keep the creditor informed between 2014 and May 2019 about his \nemployment issues, why he could not pay the delinquencies, and when he would be \nable to pay or settle the debt. \n \n\n \n  7 \n \nApplicant receives some mitigation under the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) because \nof four varying periods of unemployment between 2013 and March 2019. On the other \nhand, he receives limited mitigation under the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) because he \ndid not take any documented action (acting responsibly under the circumstances) on the \ndelinquent debts until May 2019. On one occasion in March 2014, and twice in January \n2017, instead of applying his earnings to the SOR debts, Applicant chose to apply the \nearnings to finance three vacations of five days or less to locations outside of the United \nStates. Overall, Applicant receives limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies when there is evidence of financial counseling and there are \nclear indications the problem is being resolved or under control. The only financial \ncounseling Applicant received was in May 2019, when the FSO made recommendations \nabout how to negotiate and settle debts. Applicant provided no information on the \nadvice the financial adviser provided to repair his credit. His future plans expressed at \nthe October 2019 hearing to responsibly manage his finances by saving more \naggressively and spending less have not changed since the plans he expressed in his \nApril 2018 PSI. He relies on a mental rather than a written budget. Applicant receives \nnegligible mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) has only partial application in light of Applicant\u2019s original decision to \nallow the two debts to remain delinquent until the running of the state statute of \nlimitations, at which time the debts would become legally uncollectible. Relying on the \nstatute is one approach to avoid paying delinquent debts, but it does not show a good-\nfaith effort to resolve debts within the meaning of AG \u00b6 20(d) and the Directive. See \nISCR Case No. 07-06841 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2008). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guideline (financial \nconsiderations) in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n\n \n  8 \n \nApplicant is 44 years old and married with one child. He has owned his home \nsince 2007. I have considered his periodic unemployment since 2013. However, \nApplicant\u2019s irresponsibility in failing to address the two listed delinquencies from 2014 to \nMay 2019 is not mitigated by four payments under a payment plan launched four \nmonths before the October 2019 hearing. Evidence of avoiding substantial delinquent \ndebts is not suddenly mitigated by payments under a payment plan that is motivated \nprimarily by the pressure of seeking security clearance eligibility. Applicant\u2019s financial \nirresponsibility is aggravated by his purported unfamiliarity with the federal and state tax \nramifications of his 1099 employment for over a year in 2013 and 2014, resulting in over \n$19,000 in delinquent federal taxes. Significantly, he was 38 years old during this 1099 \nemployment. His good judgment in satisfying the state taxes due for the period and \ncomplying with the federal tax repayment plan is outweighed by Applicant\u2019s puzzling \npoor judgment in submitting a W-2 Form for tax year 2018 with inaccurate information \nindicating he was exempt from federal taxes for the year. Given the fact that Applicant \nhas held a security clearance for 25 years, he knew or should have known that \ndelinquent debts and taxes raise security concerns. Considering the evidence in light of \nthe whole-person factors, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns emanating \nfrom the guideline for financial considerations.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 13, 2019 (Answer), and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 12, 2019. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July \n24, 2019; originally scheduling the hearing for August 14, 2019, but it was rescheduled \nfor September 25, 2019. The hearing was convened as rescheduled. The Government \noffered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf, and offered two sets of documents, which I marked \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A and B, and admitted into evidence. The record was left \n\n \n2 \n \nopen until November 15, 2019, for receipt of additional documentation. On November 7, \n2019, Applicant offered a set of documents, marked as AppX C and admitted into \nevidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on October 7, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations of the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 10.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2016. (GX 1 at page \n10.) He is single, but has three children: two who are adults and a seventeen-year-old, \nwho lives with Applicant due to the recent death of the child\u2019s mother. (TR at page 15 \nline 13 to page 18 line 21.) \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s past-due indebtedness goes back at least until 2015; but due to prior \nperiods of unemployment and underemployment, he has only recently began to address \nhis admitted past-due indebtedness. (TR at page 19 line 24 to page 30 line 4.) He now \nhas a positive monthly cash flow of about $625, and is well respected in his community \nand in the workplace, as evidenced by six letters of support. (AppX B, and AppX C at \npage 6.) \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits that he was indebted to Creditor A, as the result of an \nautomobile repossession, in the amount of about $15,596. This debt has been settled \nfor $6,300, and Applicant has made five of \u201c18\u201d payments, as evidenced by \ndocumentation from Creditor A. (TR at page 19 line 24 to page 23 line 10, AppX A at \npages 1 and 2, and AppX C at pages 1~4.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.b.

This debt has \nbeen paid, as evidenced by documentation from State B. (TR at page 23 line 11 to page \n26 line 17, and AppX A at page.3.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admits that he is indebted to Creditor C for a past-due credit union \ndebt, in the amount of about $4,467. Applicant is making monthly payments of $100 \ntowards this debt, as evidenced by documentation from Creditor C. (TR at page 26 line \n17 to page 27 line 12, at page 28 lines 4~25, AppX A at page 4, and AppX C at page 5.) \nThis allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admits that he was indebted to Creditor D for a past-due cable TV \ndebt, in the amount of about $239. This debt has been paid, as evidenced by \ndocumentation from Creditor D. (TR at page 29 line 1 to page 30 line 4, and Answer \nAttachment D.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant has addressed all of his delinquencies. He has demonstrated that \nfuture financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. \nThe Financial Considerations guideline is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in his community and in the workplace. He performs well at his job. \n(AppC B.) \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 63 years old, married, and has 3 adult children. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004, and served in the military from 1974 to 1979, at which time he was honorably discharged. (Item 3) Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in July 2017. During his April 2018 background interview with a Government investigator, he was asked if he had failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other tax returns when required by law. Applicant admitted to the investigator that he failed to file and pay his taxes from 2014 to 2017. He stated that his reason for failing to do so was because he was having difficulty with his wife\u2019s Social Security Disability payments and the fact that taxes were not being withheld from the payments. He told the government investigator that in addition to owing Federal taxes, he also owed state taxes to State A, and possibly State B. He indicated he was seeking assistance from a tax preparer to rectify the situation. (I will not consider any derogatory information that was not alleged.

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/08/2020 \nDecision \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 10, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 29, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on October 3, \n2019. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 4. Subsequent to the 30-day rule, Applicant \nsubmitted a response to the FORM and documents for consideration, which are marked \nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through H (each with multiple pages). Administrative \nexhibits are marked as Hearing Exhibit I. There were no other objections by Applicant or \nthe Government to any of the Items or exhibits and they are admitted into evidence. The \ncase was assigned to me on November 21, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 63 years old, married, and has 3 adult children. He received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2004, and served in the military from 1974 to 1979, at which time he \nwas honorably discharged. (Item 3) \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in July 2017. During \nhis April 2018 background interview with a Government investigator, he was asked if he \nhad failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other tax returns when required by law. Applicant \nadmitted to the investigator that he failed to file and pay his taxes from 2014 to 2017. He \nstated that his reason for failing to do so was because he was having difficulty with his \nwife\u2019s Social Security Disability payments and the fact that taxes were not being withheld \nfrom the payments. He told the government investigator that in addition to owing Federal \ntaxes, he also owed state taxes to State A, and possibly State B. He indicated he was \nseeking assistance from a tax preparer to rectify the situation. (I will not consider any \nderogatory information that was not alleged. I may consider it when applying the \nmitigating conditions, making a credibility determination, and applying the whole-person \nconcept.) (Items 2, 4) \n \nApplicant completed government interrogatories in May 2019. He indicated in them \nthat he filed his 2013, 2014, and 2015 Federal income tax returns on February 25, 2019. \nHe indicated that he filed his 2016 and 2017 Federal income tax returns on May 5, 2019. \nHe stated he filed an extension request for his 2018 Federal tax returns, and they were \nfiled by October 15, 2019. (Item 4) \n \nApplicant also stated in his answer to Government interrogatories that he filed his \n2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 State A income tax returns on February 25, 2019. \nBecause he also worked in State B in 2013, 2014, and 2015, he was required to file \nincome tax returns with that state. He failed to do so timely and filed them on February \n25, 2019. He did not work in State B other tax years. (Item 2) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated the reason he failed to timely his \nFederal and State A and B income tax returns was because \u201cI got stupid then \noverwhelmed.\u201d (Item 2) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he provided proof that he paid his 2013 Federal \ntax debt in June 2019 ($3,415). He stated: \u201cI am caught up on Federal Taxes.\u201d (Item 2) \nIn his Response to the FORM, he provided Internal Revenue Service transcripts showing \nhe has zero balances owed for tax years 2013 through 2018. He stated in his Response \nthe following: \u201cThe reason for being late is large medical bills due to wife\u2019s illness. And \nlong wait for getting her on disability.\u201d (AE A) No other information was provided regarding \nhow these facts impacted his ability to file his tax returns. (Item 2, AE A, G) \n \nApplicant provided a copy of an installment agreement he has with State A \nexecuted in May 2019. It shows he owes a balance for tax year 2015 to State A of $5,034. \nThe agreement requires him to pay $152 a month beginning in June 2019 and completing \nthe agreement in May 2022. He provided proof he made a payment to State A for $170 \nin June 2019. He also provided a \u201cCertificate of Tax Clearance\u201d from State B dated June \n2019 to show \u201ctax clearance valid through 09/22/2019.\u201d (AE G) \n \nApplicant provided exhibits documenting his military service and accomplishments \nduring that period. He provided copies of performance appraisals; his resume and job \nhistory, and an Internet article on financial issues. (AE B, C, D, E, F, H)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(g) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 federal income \ntax returns. He failed to timely file his 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 State A tax \nreturns. He failed to timely file his 2013, 2014, and 2015 State B tax returns. He was \nindebted to the Federal Government, State A and State B for delinquent taxes. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying condition. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nApplicant failed to provide a reasonable explanation for his failure to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for five years or his state income tax returns for numerous \nyears. His explanation, during his 2018 background interview that taxes were not withheld \nfrom his wife\u2019s Social Security Disability payments is not persuasive and does not justify \nhis repeated failure to file tax returns on time. He stated in his answer to the SOR that his \nreason for failing to timely file was because \u201cI got stupid and overwhelmed.\u201d His later \nexplanation in his Response to the FORM was that he was late because of his wife\u2019s \nillness and a long wait for her disability. All of his defenses fail to adequately explain why \nhe did not timely file his tax returns. It was not until after he was interviewed by a \nGovernment investigator as part of his background investigation in 2018 that he filed the \nreturns in February and May 2019. \n \nApplicant paid his 2013 federal tax debt in June 2019. He also paid his State B tax \ndebt in June 2019. In May 2019, he executed an installment agreement with State A to \npay his delinquent 2015 tax debt, which will be completed in 2022. There is insufficient \nevidence that Applicant\u2019s ability to file his tax returns each year was beyond his control. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nHis failure to do so until after he was interviewed by a government investigator does not \nshow he acted responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant completed filing his delinquent tax returns in February 2019 and May \n2019. He also has paid his delinquent federal income taxes, and paid the taxes owed to \nState B; and is in a payment plan with State A. Although Applicant has taken action to \npay his delinquent tax debts, he failed to do so until after he disclosed the information to \na Government investigator, which diminishes his good-faith actions in resolving his \ndelinquent tax debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) has limited application. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \n\n \n7 \n \n \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \n \nApplicant is 63 years old. He served honorably in the military and has a good work \nrecord. For five years, Applicant failed to comply with the law when he repeatedly failed \nto timely file his federal income tax returns and also failed to file state returns for numerous \nyears. After he disclosed this information to a Government investigator, he began taking \naction to resolve these issues and pay his delinquent federal tax debt, State B tax debt, \nand execute an installment agreement with State A. Applicant has not met his burden of \npersuasion. Ignoring his legal responsibilities for years raises questions about his \nreliability, good judgment, and trustworthiness. At this time, he has not established a track \nrecord of responsibly managing his legal obligations related to filing and paying federal \nand state taxes. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1c.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 36-year-old high school graduate with about three semesters of college. He is currently in divorce proceedings with his second wife. He has been working as a senior program manager servicing the Air Force under a contract between a staffing company and a defense contractor since August 2019. (Tr. 94.) His continued employment is contingent on a favorable adjudication of his clearance eligibility. (GE 1; AEs I, N-O.) Applicant has a service-connected 20% disability rating with the Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs (VA). (Tr. 87.) He served on active duty in the United States military with a secret clearance under the occupational specialty of military police from January 2002 to January 2007. From March 2003 through December 2003, he was deployed to Iraq and then Afghanistan. While serving at the rank of specialist (E-4) in South Korea, Applicant was accused in January 2006 with fraud, forgery, and making a false statement by producing various military school certificates allegedly fraudulently obtained regarding combat action badges, airborne school, air assault school, Special Forces training, and lateral appointment to corporal. He was also accused of impersonating a non- commissioned officer and with unauthorized wearing of a military uniform for wearing sergeant (E-5) rank when he was an E-4.

Doubts about \nhis rehabilitation of the personal conduct concerns persist because he was not candid or \ncredible in his explanation of the 2006 offenses. He has a history of financial delinquency \nthat is not fully mitigated. Clearance eligibility is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 10, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nThe SOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security- clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF \ntook the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \n\n2 \n \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn November 11, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested \na decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On December 10, 2019, the \nGovernment requested a hearing pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.7 of the Directive. On December 16, \n2019, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nOn December 30, 2019, counsel for Applicant entered his appearance. On February 3, \n2020, I scheduled a hearing for March 4, 2020. \n \nAt the hearing held as scheduled, 10 Government exhibits (GEs 1-10) and 13 \nApplicant exhibits (AEs A-M) were admitted in evidence without any objections. Applicant \ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 12, 2020. At Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, I held the record open after the hearing until March 20, 2020, for additional \ndocumentary exhibits from Applicant. On March 13, 2020, Applicant submitted through his \ncounsel four exhibits (AEs N-Q), which were accepted into the record without objection. On \nMarch 20, 2020, Applicant submitted three additional documents, which were entered into \nthe record as AEs R-T without any objection. \n \nSummary of Pleadings \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the October 10, 2019 SOR, Applicant \nwas $2,381 past due on a vehicle loan with an $80,111 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he \nowed collection debts of $21,524 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $19,585 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); $777 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); \n$19,566 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); $456 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and $328 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Under Guideline E, \nApplicant is alleged to have received non-judicial punishment and been reduced in rank in \n2006 for fraud, forgery, making a false statement, impersonation, and unauthorized \nwearing of a military uniform (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Additionally, the SOR alleges under Guideline E \nthat Applicant made a false statement to a mortgage consultant in 2017 when he claimed \nthat he had only one student loan, which had been paid in full, when he had a student loan \nin collection (SOR \u00b6 2.b.). \n \n \nApplicant submitted a detailed response with documentation, including a chronology \nof events that led or contributed to financial hardship. He denied that he was delinquent on \nthe vehicle loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a as of October 10, 2019. He indicated that the student \nloan in SOR \u00b6 1.b was listed fraudulently on his credit record. Regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.c, Applicant admitted that he owed rent for an apartment for terminating his lease \nprematurely in February 2016, but he had not paid it because he was contesting the \namount claimed by his creditor. Applicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which was for \nrented cable and modem equipment that he said he returned late. He asserted that the \ndebt has been resolved. Applicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and claimed that the \nnamed collection entity fraudulently tried to collect a student loan removed from his credit \nreport, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and fair debt collection practices. \nApplicant explained that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f was for Internet equipment at his marital \n\n3 \n \nresidence, which has been returned, so the balance should be around $200. He denied the \ninsurance debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g because he paid it, albeit after he had fallen behind on the \naccount. \n \n \nConcerning Guideline E, Applicant admitted the non-judicial punishment alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.a, but claimed he accepted after it was explained to him by the assigned Judge \nAdvocate General (JAG) officer that it would not impact his civilian career as a court-martial \nwould have done.  He denied that he was found guilty and stated, \u201cAll subsequent charges \nthat were tacked on were the result of an obsessive 1SG.\u201d He admitted that he had worn a \nsergeant uniform when he should not have, but maintained that he \u201cwas on the list to be \npromoted at any time.\u201d Applicant stated that he \u201cdid NOT commit Forgery, Fraud, or make \na False Statement,\u201d and that had he known that \u201csomeone would deviously align this \nArticle 15\u201d to his permanent duty record, he would have requested a court-marital where \nevidentiary rules apply. Applicant requested that the non-judicial punishment not be \nconsidered because it was not an admission of guilt and was beyond the scope of the SF \n86. Applicant denied the allegation that he made a false statement to a mortgage \nconsultant in 2017 (SOR \u00b6 2.b), and explained that a fraudulent listing on his credit report \nmade it appear that he had two student loans. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n  \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old high school graduate with about three semesters of \ncollege. He is currently in divorce proceedings with his second wife. He has been working \nas a senior program manager servicing the Air Force under a contract between a staffing \ncompany and a defense contractor since August 2019. (Tr. 94.) His continued employment \nis contingent on a favorable adjudication of his clearance eligibility. (GE 1; AEs I, N-O.) \n \nApplicant has a service-connected 20% disability rating with the Department of \nVeteran\u2019s Affairs (VA). (Tr. 87.) He served on active duty in the United States military with a \nsecret clearance under the occupational specialty of military police from January 2002 to \nJanuary 2007. From March 2003 through December 2003, he was deployed to Iraq and \nthen Afghanistan. While serving at the rank of specialist (E-4) in South Korea, Applicant \nwas accused in January 2006 with fraud, forgery, and making a false statement by \nproducing various military school certificates allegedly fraudulently obtained regarding \ncombat action badges, airborne school, air assault school, Special Forces training, and \nlateral appointment to corporal. He was also accused of impersonating a non-\ncommissioned officer and with unauthorized wearing of a military uniform for wearing \nsergeant (E-5) rank when he was an E-4. Applicant admitted to military investigators that \nhe had worn sergeant rank, but he denied altering documents for his enlisted records. He \nexplained that he had taken an assignment as a warfighter team leader and was informed \nin August 2006 that he had made points to be promoted to sergeant. The investigation \nrevealed that Applicant obtained a new identification card showing sergeant rank, but he \ndid not have orders showing his promotion. (GE 6.) Applicant did not request a trial by \n\n4 \n \ncourt-martial. He was found to have committed offenses with respect to all five allegations \nin a non-judicial punishment proceeding on September 18, 2006. His record was flagged \nwith a bar to reenlistment, and he was reduced in rank to private (E-1), ordered to forfeit \npay of $636 per month for two months, given 45 days of extra duty, and placed on \nrestriction for 45 days. (GEs 7-8.) His case was referred to the military criminal \ninvestigation command, who found probable cause to believe that Applicant committed the \noffenses, including that he had presented altered or false documents to the Personnel \nServices Battalion. (GE 6.) \n \nApplicant appealed the punishment, in part asking that he be allowed to separate \nfrom the military at the rank of E-3, the minimum rank required for him to report to a \nSpecial Forces command in the National Guard in January 2007. Applicant also requested \na reduction to $300 a month ($600 total) in forfeited pay because he had financial issues \ncaused by a divorce, and he had just enrolled at a state university. He asked that he be \ngiven only 14 days of restriction and 14 days of extra duty because he needed surgery and \nwould not have enough time to complete the 45 days after convalescent leave before his \nETS date of November 22, 2006. Applicant asserted on appeal of his non-judicial \npunishment that he \u201cnever did anything with wrongful intention.\u201d Applicant presented some \ncharacter references from soldiers attesting to his leadership. Those soldiers, who \nacknowledged that Applicant made \u201ca mistake,\u201d regarded his punishment as too harsh. (AE \nG.) Applicant was apparently unsuccessful in his appeal as his DD-214 shows that he was \nseparated from active duty at the rank of E-1 in January 2007. He was granted an \nhonorable discharge under the separation code of \u201cLBK\u201d (involuntary discharge). (AE G.) \n \nApplicant now denies that he committed any fraudulent activity, to include forgery \nand making a false statement, and he attributes those charges to an \u201cobsessive\u201d first \nsergeant, even though the Commander\u2019s Report of Disciplinary or Administrative Action \nindicates that he pled \u201cguilty\u201d to all five of the alleged offenses. (GE 7.) It is noted that to \nreceive a reduction from specialist (E-4) to private (E-1) and the other serious punishments \nimposed under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the imposing commander \nmust be a field grade commander, not a noncommissioned officer. Applicant explained that \nthe non-judicial punishment was for him driving a rented vehicle in Korea, in violation of the \nStatus of Forces Agreement for anyone under the E-5 rank to drive a private vehicle in \nKorea. He presented a record of Article 15 proceedings dated September 18, 2006, \nregarding his wrongful driving without authorization between July 1, 2006, and July 31, \n2006, misconduct substantiated by a staff sergeant (SSG), who swore that he witnessed \nApplicant get behind the wheel of a privately-owned vehicle in late July 2006, which was \nagainst the Status of Forces Agreement for enlisted personnel of Applicant\u2019s rank or lower \nto operate a private vehicle in Korea. The SSG attested that Applicant had told him that a \ncolonel had authorized the vehicle under an exception because he needed the vehicle for \ntraining purposes. (AE G.) Records submitted by the Government (GEs 6-8) show that the \npunishment, include the reduction in rank to E-1, was imposed for the misconduct in \nJanuary 2006. \n \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR, he admitted that he wore sergeant rank \nwhen he should not have, but asserts he had passed his E-5 Board and was on the list to \n\n5 \n \nbe promoted at any time. He claimed without any corroborating documentation that his \nLeave and Earning Statement (LES) reflected his rank as sergeant, but acknowledged that \nhe did not have formal orders of that rank. He attributed his \u201cmistake\u201d to being a \u201cyoung \nSolider that was too excited.\u201d Applicant maintained that if he had known that the \nadministrative action would impact his civilian career, he would have chosen a court-martial \nproceeding, where he could have contested the allegations with evidence and legal \nrepresentation. He explained that he accepted the non-judicial proceedings because those \nwhom he trusted most told him it was not worth going through a court-martial. (Answer; Tr. \n77-78.) \n \nIn his appeal of the non-judicial punishment, Applicant indicated that he had just \nsigned up as a student at a university. (AE G.) Applicant instead attended a different state \ncollege for a semester and a half after he was discharged from the military. (Tr. 105.) He \nwithdrew from the school in May 2008. (AE H.) The credit reports in evidence (GEs 3-4, 10) \nand a record from a loan servicer (AE H) show two student loans obtained in December \n2006: a private student loan for $16,721 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and a federal Stafford student loan \nfor $3,500 (not alleged), both in default. (AE H.) He contests the validity of the private \nstudent loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), asserting that he had only the one $3,500 student loan. (Tr. \n105.) He presented information about the $3,500 loan indicating that it was placed in \nforbearance in October 2009, January 2014, and June 2015. He defaulted on a $1,161 \nbalance in December 2016, even though his repayment term was under $50 a month. (Tr. \n106.) He paid $1,280 to resolve the debt on March 6, 2017, after his loan had been placed \nfor collection and his default reported to the credit reporting agencies. (GEs 3-4 10; AE H.) \n \nApplicant reportedly was self-employed as a yacht captain from January 2007 to \nDecember 2007 while attending college. His contract was not renewed, and he listed on an \nAugust 2017 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he was \nunemployed from January 2008 to August 2008. (GE 1.) His resume discrepantly indicates \nthat he worked as a contract communications engineer for a company that provided \ncommunications expertise to the U.S. military and private aircraft companies from August \n2007 to February 2009. (AE I.) \n \nApplicant reports that he then worked as an information technology project manager \nfor an airline until September 2011. (AE I.) He was self-employed from September 2011 to \nNovember 2013, when he relocated for a vice president position with a \u201cpartner company.\u201d \n(GE 1; AE I.) \n \nIn June 2015, Applicant began renting an apartment at $2,380 per month (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c), under a 12-month lease. (AE C.) His then employer had financial issues and reduced \nhis pay significantly. Applicant could no longer afford his rent, and he advised the property \nmanagement office that he needed to terminate the lease early. When he vacated the \napartment at the end of February 2016, he thought he had a verbal agreement from the \nmanagement company and did not have to pay the remainder of the lease, even though \nhis lease terms required him to give 60-day notice of termination and provided for a penalty \nof two months\u2019 rent for early termination. (Answer.) In May 2016, he was billed $8,111 by \n\n6 \n \nthe property management company, which included a penalty of one month\u2019s rent. (AE C.) \nIn August 2016, his account was placed for collection. (GE 3.) \n \nApplicant reported no outstanding financial delinquencies on his August 2017 SF 86 \nfor eligibility for a secret clearance to work as a consultant for an information technology \ncompany. (GE 1.) He asserted in response to the SOR that he did not learn about the \napartment debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) before approximately September 2017, when he applied for a \nhome loan. (Answer.) However, May 2016 the billing statement, which he provided in \nevidence, suggests that he knew about the debt well before September 2017. \n \nApplicant and his wife married in October 2017, after cohabiting since March 2016. \n(GE 1.) While applying for a mortgage to purchase a home, Applicant and his wife learned \nthat a creditor was reporting that he had defaulted on a student loan obtained in December \n2006, then with the creditor identified in SOR \u00b6 1.e. On September 9, 2017, Applicant and \nhis wife informed a mortgage consultant, in writing, that his \u201coriginal and only student loan \nwas paid in full the beginning of this year.\u201d They explained that the loan (i.e., his federal \nstudent loan for $3,500) went into collections \u201cfor a couple of months many years ago and \nwas sold to multiple creditors.\u201d They asserted that the listing of a $19,566 collection debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e) on his credit record was fraudulent. (GE 5; AE H.) Applicant denies that he \nmade a false statement to the mortgage consultant, explaining that his lone student loan \nwas only in default for one month before he paid it off. (Tr. 79.) \n \nWithin a few weeks of their wedding, Applicant and his wife closed on a home near \nher family in October 2017. They purchased the property in part with a VA-backed loan of \n$379,000, requiring repayment at $2,797 per month. Applicant\u2019s income was about \n$50,000 annually while his wife earned \u201cover $130,000\u201d annually. (Tr. 56, 104.) During their \nmarriage, she worked as a physician in her father\u2019s medical practice. (Tr. 56, 60.) Applicant \nand his wife were paying on a truck loan obtained in January 2016 for $71,869. The \naccount was past due in September 2016, and again from December 2016 through \nFebruary 2017. (GE 3; Tr. 120-121.) That loan was paid off in December 2017 when \nApplicant bought a 2018 Ford 150 truck for himself with a loan of $83,072, to be repaid at \n$1,415 a month. (AE A.) The loan balance was so high because he rolled the debt \nremaining on his spouse\u2019s and her sister\u2019s vehicles into his new loan. (Tr. 62, 103.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on November 14, 2017, listed several collection \nbalances: $19,566 defaulted student loan balance (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e, same debt); \n$19,585 for breaking his apartment lease in 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); $777 from June 2016 in \ndispute with a telecommunications company (SOR \u00b6 1.d); $456 for cable television \nservices (SOR 1.f); and $328 owed to an insurance company since April 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \nApplicant or his spouse was making timely payments on three credit-card accounts with \nbalances totaling $4,019. (GE 3.) \n \n \nIn mid-March 2018, Applicant started a new job as a contract program manager \nsupporting the U.S. Army. He indicated in response to the SOR that he was \u201cso close to \nbeing financially stable\u201d in the spring of 2018. Yet, available credit information indicates \nthat Applicant and his wife began falling behind on their mortgage in April 2018. The \n\n7 \n \naccount information for his new truck loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) shows that his payments have been \nchronically late since February 2018, and he has been regularly assessed late fees. (AE \nA.) \n \nApplicant and his wife legally separated in early July 2018. (Tr. 56, 94.) In \nApplicant\u2019s July 9, 2018 petition for divorce, he asked the court to equitably divide, \ndistribute, or assign the marital property between him and his wife without regard to her \nmarital misconduct. (AE N.) \n \nOn August 6, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He indicated that he would not be responsible for \nany of the marital debt. When confronted about the adverse credit entries on his credit \nrecord, Applicant admitted that he had a student loan that had been in default for $1,161, \nbut that he then paid it. Applicant denied any knowledge of the $328 insurance debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.g) and stated that his account was current. Applicant asserted that the cable services \ndebt for $456 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) was his wife\u2019s responsibility. When asked about the student loan \nwith a listed high credit of $16,721 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), Applicant did not dispute that he had \nobtained a student loan in December 2006, or that he had fallen behind because he had \nnot realized that the payments were being drawn from his account past their due dates. \nApparently thinking of his federal student loan, he asserted that when the matter was \nbrought to his attention, he brought the account current and stated that he could provide \ndocumentation of its satisfaction. Applicant recognized the $777 telecommunications debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d), but stated that he was in the process of disputing the charge because the \naccount was in his wife\u2019s name. Applicant stated that he was also disputing the charges \nowed a former landlord (SOR \u00b6 1.c). (GE 2.) \n \nThe divorce proceedings put a \u201chuge strain\u201d on Applicant\u2019s finances. He testified that \nhe had to pay his divorce attorney around $22,700, but has paid all but $1,000 of her fees. \n(Tr. 121.) On October 1, 2018, his divorce attorney billed him for $10,000 to replenish his \ntrust account for legal matters. (AE P.) \n \nIn December 2018, Applicant moved near his family into a family-owned house, and \nhe listed the marital property for sale. He did not make the mortgage payments, and his \nand his spouse\u2019s mortgage lender eventually initiated foreclosure of their mortgage loan. In \nMay 2019, Applicant refinanced his truck loan to remove his ex-wife\u2019s name from any legal \nresponsibility for paying for his truck, as required by the terms of his pending divorce. His \ntruck payment on his new loan was 13 days late for June 2019, 14 days late for July 2019, \n14 days late for August 2019, 19 days late for September 2019, and 10 days late for \nOctober 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) (AE A), although his account was reported as current to the \ncredit bureaus. (GE 10.) \n \nIn August 2019, Applicant began his current job at an hourly rate of $52.13 per hour. \n(AEs I, Q; Tr. 55.) He used his remaining savings to cover the costs of his relocation. \n(Answer.) \n \n\n8 \n \nAs of October 2019, Applicant\u2019s credit report showed that the mortgage on his and \nhis wife\u2019s marital residence was in foreclosure proceedings with a $408,876 balance. A \nprivate student loan for $16,721 had been charged off as a bad debt after no payments \nsince June 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), but it was also reported that his dispute about the debt had \nbeen resolved. (GE 10.) On November 8, 2019, Applicant and his wife sold their marital \nresidence for $350,000 plus fees for a total of $380,838 from the buyer at settlement. \nSome $327,673 went to pay off their loan on the house. (AE K.) \n \nOn October 10, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant, in part because of \nthe delinquent accounts on his credit reports. Available credit information showed the \nfollowing with respect to the SOR accounts: \n \nVehicle loan past due for $2,381 on an $80,111 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n \n \nPayment records for the truck loan indicate that since December 2017, Applicant \nhad been assessed $1,427.32 in late charges. His payments have been consistently late. \nAfter making a late payment for October 2019, his loan had a principal balance of $68,863. \n(AE A.) Applicant\u2019s explanation for being chronically late is that he has had to pay his \ndivorce attorney, and she recommended that he pay debts only when she advised him to \npay. (Tr. 101.) Applicant asserted that he is now caught up in his payments, because in \nDecember 2018, he had his lender add one month to the end of his loan. (Tr. 101-103.) \n \nStudent loan for $21,524 in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b, same debt as SOR \u00b6 1.e) \n \n \nThe credit bureaus have consistently reported that Applicant obtained a joint private \nloan in December 2006. (GEs 3-4, 10.) Applicant told the military in late fall 2006 that he \nhad just signed up as a full-time student at a university. He may have obtained a private \nstudent loan for that institution, which he ultimately did not attend, although there is no \nevidence in this regard.  As of July 2017, the loan was reportedly charged off and in \ncollection for $16,721. (GEs 3-4.) In August 2019, the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b placed a \n$22,608 debt for collection. (GE 10; AE B.) The creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a student-loan \ntrust entity with a history of using service providers to file lawsuits to collect defaulted \nstudent loans barred from collection under the applicable statue of limitations or without \ndocumentation to prove that the person owed the debt. (GE 9.) On October 1, 2019, a \ncollection entity informed Applicant that the creditor was willing to accept $9,129 in \nsettlement of a $22,823 balance. On November 4, 2019, Applicant requested validation of \nthe debt (AE B), which was still on his credit record as an outstanding collection debt. (GE \n10.) Applicant had received no response to his correspondence as of March 2020. He \nasserts that the debt is fraudulent, but he provided no documentation showing the debt has \nbeen removed from his credit record. (Tr. 63, 108.) Applicant has retained a lawyer to \nassist him with regard to whether to file a lawsuit against the student-loan trust entity, but it \nhas yet to be shown if legal action against the trust entity by the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau (CFPB) applies to him. (Tr. 108.)  \n\n9 \n \nApartment rent collection debt for $19,585 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \n \n \nApplicant prematurely terminated his lease for an apartment in February 2016 when \nhe could no longer afford the rent. (Answer.) At his hearing, he testified that for five or six \nmonths in 2016, he was not paid because his then employer lost contracts, and he had no \nincome apart from his VA disability. (Tr. 64-65, 91-93.) On May 4, 2016, he was billed \n$8,111 by his former landlord for back rent and utilities. In August 15, 2016, his account \nwas placed for collection. On September 27, 2019, a collection entity informed Applicant \nthat his creditor would be willing to settle his debt balance of $19,584 for $9,792. (AE C.) \nOn November 1, 2019, Applicant contacted the collection entity for another offer. He \nasserts that he was told the creditor wanted the full balance. Applicant verbally asked for a \nverification of the debt. (Answer.) On December 15, 2019, Applicant sent a letter \nrequesting validation of the debt. (AE L.) Applicant testified that he is solely responsible for \nany balance owed because his wife (then fianc\u00e9e) was not on the lease (Tr. 65), but also \nthat he is willing to split a bill of $6,000 with his estranged wife on their divorce settlement. \n(Tr. 95-98.) Applicant\u2019s October 2019 credit report states \u201cAccount information disputed by \nconsumer, meets FCRA requirements.\u201d (GE 10.) In response to the Government\u2019s position \nthat the debt appears to be a legitimate debt that meets the Fair Collection Requirements \nAct, Applicant testified that he mistakenly disputed the debt under an incorrect criteria and \nshould have disputed the amount owed. (Tr. 100.) As of March 2020, Applicant had made \nno payments on the debt. Should he receive no response from the creditor to his request \nfor verification, he plans to \u201ctake the legal actions appointed to [him] as a consumer.\u201d (Tr. \n118.) \n  \nTelecommunications company debt for $777 in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \n \n \nA $777 debt with a telecommunications company from January 2016 was in \ncollection as of December 2018. (GE 4.) As of October 2019, the debt was on his credit \nrecord as an unpaid collection balance. (GE 10.) Applicant submits that the credit entry \nshould have been removed from his credit record some time ago because the debt was for \nold rented equipment that he returned late. He presented in evidence an October 2019 \nbilling statement showing that he was an existing customer of the creditor and had just \nreduced his monthly charges from $235 to $124 by bundling services. (AE D.) While that \naccount was current, the account bears a different number than that reported for the debt \nin collection. (GE 10.) On November 4, 2019, Applicant sent a letter to the collection entity \nrequesting validation of the debt. (AE D.) \n \nCable services debt for $456 in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.f) \n \n \nAs of October 2017, a cable debt of $456 was in collection. (GE 3.) Applicant \nexplained that his wife did not turn in equipment from their marital residence on time. (Tr. \n67.) As of November 2019, Applicant was being pursued for a collection balance of $710 \nby another cable services company, which Applicant asserts was for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \n(AE E.) He provided no documentation for his claim that the two companies had \u201csome sort \nof entity agreement.\u201d On November 4, 2019, Applicant sent a letter to the collection entity \nrequesting validation of the debt. On December 17, 2019, he received a response from the \n\n10 \n \ncollection entity pursuing him for the $710 indicating that his account had been closed and \nreturned to the creditor. (AE E.) There is no evidence that the $456 debt has been paid or \nthat it is fraudulent, although it had been removed from his credit record as of December \n2018. (GE 4.) Applicant claims that the debt was removed from his credit because his wife \nadded his name to the account after the fact. (GE 4; Tr. 71-73.) Applicant testified that the \ndebt is in dispute. (Tr. 77.) \n \nInsurance debt for $328 in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.g) \n \n \nApplicant incurred the debt due to financial hardship caused by his divorce, but he \npaid the debt in full. (Tr. 74.) The alleged debt does not appear on Applicant\u2019s credit report \nas of October 2019. (GE 10.) Records of Applicant\u2019s account with the insurance provider \nshow that, after a $205 payment in late December 2018, he renewed his policy at a cost of \n$1,028 for six months.  He set up $169 automatic payments that were declined. His policy \nwas cancelled in late March 2019 for nonpayment with $567 owed. After a payment \ncleared in late March 2019, his coverage was reinstated. In July 2019, his policy was \nrenewed. After a payment of $252 in late September 2019, he was billed $463 in October \n2019. (AE F.) \n \n \nAs of October 2019, Trans Union was reporting additional debts not listed in the \nSOR, including a collection debt of $912 from September 2018 that was charged off in May \n2019 by an online home furnishings retailer. (GE 10.) As of November 2019, Applicant was \ndisputing the debt on the basis that his wife opened it for furniture for their marital \nhousehold, although he indicated that he would pay it if verified. (Answer.) A letter from the \ncollection entity indicates that Applicant was the account holder and that he paid $273 on \nMarch 4, 2020. (AE S.) Trans Union was also reporting that a $6,194 debt, on an account \nopened in December 2014, had been charged off in June 2015 after no payments since \nJanuary 2015. (GE 10.) Applicant testified that it was a marital debt for furniture for their \nhome. (Tr. 111.) The evidence shows that the debt was incurred two years before he and \nhis wife bought their home, and prior to their reported cohabitation. Applicant wants his \nspouse to agree in the divorce to hold him harmless for debts she incurred in his name. \nApplicant testified that his divorce attorney advised him to not pay any of the revolving \ncredit-card accounts on his credit report before his divorce settlement is finalized. (Tr. 57.)  \nApplicant terminated the services of his divorce attorney in February 2020 because of the \nexpense. He has elected to proceed pro se in his divorce proceedings going forward. (Tr. \n58.) \n \n \nOn March 13, 2020, Applicant provided a copy of the proposed divorce settlement, \nwhich has yet to be executed. Under the pending divorce settlement, charges in Applicant\u2019s \nname are solely his responsibility. As for joint credit-card debts, Applicant wants his spouse \nto agree to hold him harmless for six accounts, none of which are listed in the SOR. Utility \nbills incurred while the marital house was vacant from December 2018 to November 2019 \nare to be divided equally. (AE O.) \n \n \nApplicant rents an apartment in the city for $2,600 per month. He has nothing in \nsavings, but he has checking account deposits of approximately $10,000. (Tr. 115.) \n\n11 \n \n \n \nOn January 23, 2020, Applicant\u2019s military customer requested an interim access \nwaiver for six months to allow Applicant access to a NIPRnet network on the military base. \nThe request was approved on January 27, 2020. (AE J.) As of March 4, 2020, Applicant \nwas the project lead on a program involving an acquisition strategy on cyber technologies \nfor the military. (AE M; Tr. 86.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n12 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant was chronically late in making his payment on his truck loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nobtained in December 2017 almost from the start. His excuse was that he was told by his \ndivorce attorney to make payments on his marital debts only when she directed. However, \naccount information shows that he was assessed late fees each month in the five months \npreceding his marital separation. The evidence shows that Applicant took on more debt \nthan he could reasonably afford. As of December 2018, his vehicle loan was past due for \n$2,381. The evidence also establishes that Applicant broke his apartment lease in \nFebruary 2016 by vacating the premises early. He was billed $8,111 in May 2016 for back \nrent, utilities, and other fees. As of October 2019, the debt was in collection for $19,585. \nApplicant has been unwilling to settle with the creditor because he disputes the amount. He \nclaims that the debt should be about $6,000, and should be split between him and his \nestranged spouse in their divorce, although he also testified that he was the only signatory \nto the lease. \n \n\n13 \n \nAvailable credit reports in evidence list additional delinquencies, which Applicant \nclaims are either fraudulent, such as the private student loan in collection for $22,823 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b, same debt as SOR \u00b6 1.e); have been paid (SOR \u00b6 1.g); or were resolved by \nhim or his wife returning cable equipment (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f). Under \u00b6 E3.1.14 of the \nDirective, the government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish controverted \nfacts. The Appeal Board held in ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010) that \na credit report is sufficient to meet the government\u2019s burden of producing evidence of \ndelinquency: \n  \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for the \ndebt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \nAll of the debts in the SOR appear on one or more of the reports of Applicant\u2019s \ncredit. The following four disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 have some applicability in \nthis case: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \n \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n\n14 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial issues did not occur so \nlong ago and involved several accounts, including such significant accounts as his truck \nloan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and the mortgage on his marital home (not alleged). Moreover, the \nAppeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing \ncourse of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F \nmitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Applicant presented no proof of any \npayments toward resolving his debts apart from his truck loan. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability because of Applicant\u2019s lack of employment \nincome for about five or six months in 2016 when his then employer lost some contracts. \nThe apartment debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is directly attributable to this lack of income. Applicant\u2019s \nmarital separation and impending divorce are circumstances that also trigger AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant testified that he incurred about $22,700 in attorney fees from his divorce, of \nwhich he has apparently paid all but $1,000. Even so, his financial problems cannot all be \nexplained by the dissolution of his short-lived marriage. Applicant overextended himself \nfinancially by taking on a vehicle loan for $71,869 in January 2016, requiring repayment at \n$1,249 per month, and then obtaining a mortgage loan for $379,000 in October 2017, \nrequiring repayment at $2,797 per month. He compounded his financial problems by rolling \nvehicle debt for his wife and her sister into a loan of $83,072 for his 2018 model-year truck \nin December 2017. \n \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of his control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). His evidence falls somewhat short in that regard. He \nhas explained that he was chronically late in his payments on his truck loan because he \nwas acting on the advice of his divorce attorney, who wanted to ensure no duplicate \npayments. However, account records for that loan show that he was late in his payments in \nthe months preceding his marital separation, when he would have not had any need for a \ndivorce attorney. He claimed that he restructured his loan in March 2019 to remove his \nspouse\u2019s name, but then persisted in his late payments thereafter. Additionally, while it is \nnot unreasonable for Applicant to ask for verification of the delinquencies on his credit \nrecord, he knew or should have known as of his August 2018 personal subject interview \n\n15 \n \nthat the debts in the SOR were of concern to the DOD. There is no documentation showing \nthat he sent timely letters to his creditors requesting verification of his debts. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) have limited applicability. Applicant testified that he caught up \non his truck loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), but he had to ask his lender in December 2019 to add one \nmonth to the end of his loan. The insurance debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g) has been paid and his \naccount brought current. Applicant\u2019s current billing statement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d \nshows he does not have an outstanding balance on that account. There is no evidence \nshowing the $777 debt incurred at his marital residence has been paid. Similarly, there is \nno proof that the $456 cable services debt has been resolved. If the debt is the same as \nthe $710 cable debt, AE E shows that the account has been closed and returned to his \ncreditor with the adverse credit entry to be deleted from his record. The fact that a \ncollection entity returned a debt is not the same as payment, and removal of a credit listing \nmight be because the debt is no longer held by the collection entity and has been \ntransferred to a different collection agency. Even if Applicant no longer owes the $710, he \ndid not show that it is the same debt as the $456 cable services debt in collection. \n \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing disregard of the apartment debt for $19,585 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) is of \nsignificant security concern. Applicant has not made any payments to address his back \nrent because he disputes the balance as to the rent delinquency. Applicant bears some \nresponsibility for the apartment debt\u2019s accrual to $19,585 because of his failure to be more \nproactive in resolving the debt. Although he claimed that he tried several times to come to \nan agreement over a more reasonable balance with his former landlord, he did not request \nverification of the debt in writing until December 2019. His October 2019 credit report \nshows that the debt met the standards of the FCRA. Neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) is \nsatisfied as to that delinquency. \n \nAs for the private student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b, duplicated in SOR \u00b6 1.e), Applicant \nmaintains that he obtained only one loan, a federal student loan for $3,500, which he paid \nin March 2017, after he had defaulted on the loan in December 2016 for $1,161. The \nCFPB took action against the student-loan trust named in SOR \u00b6 1.a in September 2017 \nfor illegal collection practices, but Applicant did not provide any documentation to prove he \nwas the victim of a predatory collection practice. The company who previously serviced his \nfederal loan reports that it held a second loan, a private loan. That loan servicer is not \nnamed in the CFPB action. Unfortunately, the documentation from the loan servicer does \nnot include any account numbers. Applicant provided no documentation proving that the \nprivate student loan was listed on his credit record in error or is a fraudulent listing. At the \nsame time, Applicant persists in denying the validity of the loan. No evidence was provided \nshowing that the loan was disbursed to Applicant. The listed acquisition date of the loan, \nDecember 2006, was around the time that Applicant told the military in appeal of his non-\njudicial punishment that he intended to attend a state university that he ultimately did not \nattend. I cannot speculate as to whether the loan funds were disbursed. The evidence falls \nshort of establishing that the private student loan is a valid debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the \nstudent loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b, duplicated in SOR \u00b6 1.e).  \n \n\n16 \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility does not simply turn on the issue of the \nstudent loan, however. Applicant showed poor financial judgment in his handling of the \napartment debt and taking on a truck loan for $83,072 that he has struggled to pay on time. \nThe Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that he has paid \noff each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Yet, the Appeal Board reiterated in ADP \nCase No. 17-0063 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan for \ndebt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences a \nserious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d Applicant has no payment plan in place for the \ndelinquency owed his former landlord. He has not provided proof that the delinquencies in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f are resolved. The financial considerations security concerns are not \nadequately mitigated. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \nApplicant was found to have committed offenses by a field grade officer in a non-\njudicial punishment proceeding in September 2006 of forgery, fraud, making a false \nstatement, unauthorized wearing for a military uniform, and impersonation. His misconduct \nwas adjudged a bar to reenlistment, and he was separated involuntarily with an honorable \ndischarge from the military in January 2007. AG \u00b6 16(d) applies. It states: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of: \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \nIn reliance on the adverse credit information showing a defaulted private student \nloan (SOR \u00b6 1.b, duplicated in SOR \u00b6 1.e), the SOR also alleges that Applicant deliberately \nmade a false statement to a mortgage consultant in September 2017 when he stated that \nhe had only one student loan, i.e., his federal student loan, which he paid in March 2017, a \nfew months after he defaulted. Whereas there exists some doubt as to whether Applicant \n\n17 \n \nis contractually obligated for the debt, I am unable to conclude that Applicant lied to the \nmortgage consultant about his student-loan delinquency.  \n \nApplication of AG \u00b6 16(d) because of Applicant\u2019s misconduct in 2006 while serving \non active duty triggers consideration of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. AG \u00b6 17(c) \napplies because of the passage of almost 14 years since the misconduct. AG \u00b6 17(c) \nprovides: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nYet, despite the passage of so much time, Applicant has not shown that he fully \naccepts responsibility for that behavior. He denies any fraudulent activity, even though the \nCommander\u2019s report of disciplinary action (GE 7) indicates that he pled \u201cguilty\u201d to all five of \nthe offenses, including forgery, fraud, and making a false statement. Instead of showing \nthe reform that could have triggered AG \u00b6 17(d) (\u201cthe individual has acknowledged the \nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, of other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d), \nApplicant would have the Government believe that it involved only driving a private vehicle, \nwhich he needed for warfighter training, and that his unauthorized wearing of sergeant rank \nwas only \u201cpartially wrong\u201d because his LES reflected his rank as E-5. His current lack of full \ncandor about his misconduct in 2006 causes lingering doubt about his personal conduct. \nFor the reasons noted, the personal conduct security concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nSome of the adjudicative process factors were addressed under Guideline F and \nGuideline E, but some warrant additional comment. The security clearance proceeding is \nnot intended to punish an applicant for past shortcomings. Applicant was only 22 years old \nwhen he committed the misconduct that led to his non-judicial punishment. He was given \n\n18 \n \nan involuntary discharge from the military, but his service was characterized as honorable, \nperhaps in recognition of his service in hazardous-duty locations. Applicant is to be \ncredited for his professional advancements. He has a well-paying job and, while there are \nno statements from co-workers or his military customer about the quality of his work, he \nwas granted an interim access waiver to support a program for the Air Force in January \n2020. In terms of his career, he has come a long way. Yet, he continues to act in self-\ninterest and display poor judgment in terms of accepting responsibility, even with respect to \naddressing his financial delinquencies. He blames his late payments on his truck loan on \nhis divorce and advice from his attorney not to pay debts until she advised him to do so, \neven when the evidence shows that he struggled to pay his loan on time from the start, \nmonths before his wife told him she wanted a divorce. He has not shown good faith with \nrespect to reaching an acceptable solution to the apartment debt. He has the funds \navailable to pay the $777 and $456 collection debts on his credit record, which are not \nmentioned in pending divorce settlement, and has not provided clear evidence of \nsatisfaction. \n \nThe security clearance assessment is a reasonable and careful evaluation of an \napplicant\u2019s circumstances and whether they cast doubt upon his judgment, self-control, and \nother characteristics essential to protecting national security information. It is well settled \nthat once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security-clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions to the evidence presented, I continue to have some doubts about Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n19 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On June 25, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG), effective on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on August 1, 2019, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. On September 3, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On September 24, 2019, DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing setting the case for November 13, 2019.

She denied \nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.i, and provided explanations. Her admissions are \nincorporated into these findings.  \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old. She was married from 2006 to 2013, and has a child \nfrom that marriage of whom she has sole custody. She served on active duty in the Navy \nfrom 2004 to 2014, when she was honorably discharged as an E-5. While serving she \nheld a security clearance. (GE 1) \n \n \nAfter leaving the service, Applicant was unemployed from September 2014 until \nApril 2015. She attended college fulltime during that period, and used her veteran\u2019s \nbenefits for tuition and housing. In April 2015, she started a position with a federal \ncontractor and had an annual salary of $137,000. She was terminated in November 2015 \nbecause she did not have a security clearance. She was then unemployed from \nDecember 2015 to August 2016, and returned to college fulltime. She has two more \nclasses to complete for an associate\u2019s degree. From September 2016 to June 2017, she \nworked for a state social service agency and earned $29,000 annually. She was unable \nto pay her expenses on that salary and left that position. She then moved back into her \nfamily\u2019s home. In October 2017, she started working for a federal contractor. She worked \nfor federal contractors up to September 2019 when her most recent contract ended. Her \nsalary for the last two years was about $50,000 annually. (Tr. 23-29, 34-40; GE 1, 2) \n \n \nOn October 10, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. In it, \nshe disclosed delinquent debts. She attributed them to a lack of employment. (GE 1) In \nJuly 2018, a government investigator interviewed her. During the interview, she discussed \nher background, employment history, and other issues, including some of the delinquent \ndebts listed on a credit report and subsequently alleged in the SOR. (GE 2) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) from March 2019 and November 2017, the \nSOR alleged nine debts, which became delinquent between 2014 and 2017, and totaled \n$30,382. The SOR also alleged an unpaid state tax lien for $2,570 that was filed in 2018 \nfor tax year 2014. (GE 3, 4) The status of each debt is as follows: \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n  \n1. (1.a) The $7,758 charged-off credit card account was settled for $3,491 and \nwas paid in September 2019. Applicant opened the account in April 2016, while \nunemployed and used it for living expenses. It was charged off in November \n2017. She stated she was making monthly payments on the account when she \nstarted the security clearance process. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 40-45; AE A \nat 2; AE C).  \n \n2. (1.b) The $7,550 debt owed to a credit union was settled for $2,138 and paid \non November 14, 2019. She opened the account in May 2014 while on active \nduty. It was charged off in October 2017. She had been making monthly \npayments of $100 since May 2018. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 45-48; GE 2; AE \nD )  \n \n3. (1.c) The $6,190 debt owed to an apartment complex was settled for $4,344 \nand paid in full on June 23, 2019. She had been making payments on it. This \ndebt is resolved. (Tr. 49-50; AE 2 at 3, AE E)  \n \n4. (1.d) The $4,078 charged-off account owed to a bank was settled for $1,506, \nand is paid. She opened the account in March 2014 and it became delinquent \nin May 2014. She started making payments on this personal loan in February \n2019. This debt is resolved. (Tr.50-52; GE 1; AE I) \n \n5. (1.e) The $2,626 charged-off account owed to a credit union was settled for \n$525. She opened the account in May 2016, while unemployed. She started \nmaking payments in January 2019 and paid it off on November 14, 2019. This \ndebt is resolved. (Tr. 52-53; GE 3; AE F)  \n \n6. (1.f) Applicant testified that the $418 charged-off debt owed to a retail store was \nnot her debt, although she had an old account with the creditor. She contacted \nthe creditor, who told her that it did not have information linking any charges to \nher account, meaning she did not have a delinquent debt. She wrote the \ncreditor a letter about a possible fraudulent charge. In November 2019, the \nretailor sent Applicant a response stating that it was no longer attempting to \ncollect the debt. It no longer appears on her November 2019 credit report, \nalthough it was on the Government\u2019s March 2019 credit report. This debt is \nresolved. (Tr. 54-56; GE 3; AE A)   \n \n7. (1.g) Applicant denied owing the $385 charged-off credit card debt. According \nto the November 2017 CBR, this account was opened in December 2012 and \ncharged-off in September 2013. Applicant stated in her Answer that on August \n1, 2019, she called and spoke to a specific agent with the creditor, who told her \nthat there was no open or closed account in her name. It does not appear on \nher March or November 2019 CBRs. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 58-59; GE 3, 4; \nAE A) (Inadvertently, this debt was not discussed during this hearing.) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n8. (1.h) Applicant denied owing the $924 collections account debt owed to a cable \ncompany. She said she previously had service with the company and paid the \ncontract in full. She tried to contact the collection agency for the creditor, but \ncould not find a working number. The account was reported as delinquent in \nNovember 2017 and listed as open on the Government\u2019s November 2017 CBR. \nThe debt does not appear on the Government\u2019s March 2019 CBR or Applicant\u2019s \nNovember 2019 CBR. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 58-60; GE 4 at 19, GE 3; AE \nA)  \n \n9. (1.i) The $456 collections account for utilities is resolved. It is listed on \nApplicant\u2019s November 2019 CBR as having been paid in January 2018, and \nthere is also on a letter from a collection agency noting it was paid in November \n2019. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 60-61; AE A at 3, AE H)  \n \n10.  (1.j) In June 2018, a state filed a tax lien against Applicant for a $2,570 \njudgment debt for tax year 2014. Applicant learned of this debt when she \nreceived the June 2019 SOR. She thinks notices regarding this lien were sent \nto her old address so she did not know about it. She contacted the state, and \nwas told that this lien was filed because she had not filed her state income tax \nreturn that year. She has not entered into a repayment plan yet because she \nhas not had enough money to make payments. She intends to pay it; however, \nthere is no evidence that she has filed the 2014 return. This debt is unresolved. \n(Tr. 62-65; GE 5)  \n \n \nApplicant has not been employed since October 2019. She knew her job was \nterminating and planned for the loss of income. She prepaid her November and \nDecember 2019 rent, along with other expenses. Currently, she receives $430 in child \nsupport and $460 in disability from the veteran\u2019s administration (VA) each month. She \nalso collects $357 weekly in unemployment. She is returning to college in January 2020, \nand will use her veteran\u2019s benefits. She will take the minimum number of classes to \nremain in fulltime status. (Tr. 65-72) Applicant has not taken financial or credit counseling \nrecently; however, she took budget courses while serving in the military. (Tr. 30-31) I \noffered Applicant the opportunity to submit a written budget, but she did not do so. (Tr. \n75-76) \n \n \nIn addition to filing a $2,570 tax lien against Applicant in June 2018 for her unpaid \n2014 taxes, the state also filed a $1,515 tax lien against her in April 2019. (GE 6) Applicant \nadmitted that she owed both liens. In discussing them, Applicant stated that she has not \nfiled her 2018 federal or state income tax returns and may owe taxes for that year, \nalthough she appeared unclear as to that issue. She said she filed her 2017 tax returns. \n(Tr. 32-33, 64-65, 73-74.)  \n \n \nThe SOR did not allege a security concern related to the 2019 tax lien or \nApplicant\u2019s unfiled 2018 federal or state income tax returns or unpaid taxes for that year. \nThis information is not considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered in \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nmaking a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a \ncomprehensive whole-person analysis. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and an \nunpaid state tax lien. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out conditions that could potentially mitigate those \nfinancial security concerns under this guideline: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n \n \n \n7\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant began accumulating delinquent debts after she left military service in \n2014, and subsequently experienced periods of unemployment and underemployment \nfrom 2014 to 2017. Those were circumstances that may have been beyond her control to \nsome extent, although based on her voluntary choices. However, she did not present \nsufficient evidence of attempting to responsibly manage her delinquent debts until 2018 \nand 2019. The evidence does not establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n \n \nApplicant has not participated in credit or financial counseling since leaving military \nservice. She presented evidence that nine alleged delinquent debts, which totaled \n$30,282, were recently paid or resolved through partial payment agreements. AG \u00b6 20(c) \nprovides some mitigation for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, and 1.i. The \n$2,570 state lien has not been resolved and is not under control. \n \n \n \nApplicant initiated a good-faith effort to resolve delinquent debts through payment \nplans prior to the issuance of the SOR. She established some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) \nas to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, and 1.i. Applicant denied and disputed \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.i. She presented sufficient evidence to show \nthat the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.h, were not her debts. She established \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(e) as to those debts. Applicant has not established a payment \nplan for her unpaid 2014 state income taxes. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old veteran, who served in the Navy for 10 years. After \nleaving military service in 2014, she began experiencing financial difficulties as a \nconsequence of being unemployed or underemployed for periods of time. She secured \nsteady employment in late 2017, and began addressing some delinquent debts in 2018. \nAlthough Applicant has resolved the delinquent retail and personal accounts alleged in \nthe SOR, she has not filed her 2014 state tax return, which she learned in June 2019 was \nthe basis for the 2018 tax lien. In addition, she has not resolved or investigated the state \ntax lien filed in June 2019. She indicated that she has not filed her 2018 federal and state \ntax returns and does not know the amount of taxes she may owe. Applicant\u2019s failure to \nresponsibly manage her federal and state tax obligations is a matter of ongoing concern. \n \n \nThe record evidence leaves me with doubt as to her judgment and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under the \nfinancial considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i: \n \n    \nFor Applicant \n \n                       Subparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his June 27, 2018 security clearance application (SCA), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence, I make the following findings of fact: Guideline B, Foreign Preference Applicant (57) was born in the Philippines. He entered the United States with his parents in 1983 at the age of 19. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1984 to 2004, and retired as a staff sergeant (pay grade E-6), with 20 years of honorable service.

He did not falsify a DOD questionnaire as \nalleged. His request for national security eligibility and access to classified information is \ngranted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 21, 2019 the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder guidelines B, F, and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. \n2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, \n2016), effective for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n\n2 \n \nOn July 12, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On \nSeptember 13, 2019, the case was initially assigned to another administrative judge, and \non November 8, 2019, it was reassigned to a second administrative judge. On November \n26, 2019, the case was reassigned to me. On November 19, 2019, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling the hearing on January 9, 2020.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered seven \ndocuments, which she marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 - 7. She also presented a \nwritten request that I take administrative notice of certain facts about the country \nconditions in the Republic of the Philippines (the Philippines). I marked Department \nCounsel\u2019s Exhibit List as Hearing Exhibit I and the Government\u2019s Request for \nAdministrative Notice as Hearing Exhibit II.  \n \nApplicant attached six exhibits to his SOR answer, which he marked as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AE) A through F. Applicant testified. I left the record open until January 17, 2020, \nfor Applicant to submit additional documentation. On January 15, 2020, Applicant\u2019s law \nfirm submitted four additional exhibits, which I have marked as AE G through J. I marked \nthe correspondence from the office of the Applicant\u2019s law firm as Hearing Exhibit III.  \n \nAll exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. On January 21, 2020, \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.). \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \n \nApplicant did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s Request for Administrative \nNotice of certain facts about the country conditions in the Philippines. I have taken \nadministrative notice of the certain facts that are supported by source documents, which \nare official U.S. Government publications. These facts are summarized in the Findings of \nFact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his June 27, 2018 security \nclearance application (SCA), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the \nrecord. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and \nthe documentary evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Preference \n \n \nApplicant (57) was born in the Philippines. He entered the United States with his \nparents in 1983 at the age of 19. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1984 to 2004, \nand retired as a staff sergeant (pay grade E-6), with 20 years of honorable service. While \nserving in the Marine Corps, he was deployed overseas several times. He married in \n1984. His wife was also born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United States. \n\n3 \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in 1993. His wife is also a naturalized U.S. citizen. (AE \nB; Tr. at 49.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife have three adult children. The children were born in the \nPhilippines and are naturalized U.S. citizens. Applicant has an older brother and an older \nsister, who are citizens and residents of the Philippines. In his SOR answer, Applicant \nwrote that his contacts with his foreign family members are not frequent. He testified that \nhe speaks with his siblings during holidays and on other occasions, totaling three or four \ntimes a year. He also testified that he \u201cseldom\u201d speaks with his mother-in-law, perhaps \ntwo or three times a year. He was last in the Philippines in 2003 when his father died. \nApplicant returned his father\u2019s remains to the Philippines for burial. Neither his siblings \nnor his mother-in-law have ever visited him and his family in the United States. (SOR \nanswer at 2-3; AE B; Tr. at 25-27, 30, 49, 52-53.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother works in the Philippines as a traffic officer. His sister is a retired \npsychologist. His relatives in the Philippines are poor. They have no knowledge about \nApplicant\u2019s employment history and current status, except that he is a retired Marine. (Tr. \nat 29-31.) \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \n \n \nApplicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2006 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. \nSince his discharge from the Marine Corps in 2004, Applicant has been employed by \nfederal contractors with three periods of unemployment, specifically from July to \nNovember 2009, December 2014 to May 2016, and October 2017 to June 2018. \nAltogether, he experienced about 28 months of unemployment since December 2014. \nEach period of unemployment began with the expiration of the government contract on \nwhich he was working. During the period April 2013 through November 2013, he was \ndeployed to a war zone by his employer, a major U.S. Government contractor. He was \nrehired by that contractor in April 2019 to work as a logistics support representative. \nStarting with his years serving in the Marine Corps, he has worked for 35 years in the \nfield of logistics. While serving in the Marine Corps, Applicant was granted a security \nclearance in 1993. His clearance was renewed in 2010. (Tr. at 19-22.)  \n \n \nIn late 2013, Applicant began to experience financial difficulties when he was \nworking in a war zone. Pursuant to a change in U.S Government policy, he and many \nothers were ordered to return from the war zone prematurely. Applicant was subsequently \nlaid off. He was highly paid for his work in the war zone. Upon his return to the United \nStates, he incurred significant tax liabilities due to his loss of the favorable tax rules \navailable to U.S. taxpayers who live and work outside of the United States. This resulted \nin unanticipated taxes, which aggravated his financial distress from his loss of \nemployment. At the time Applicant applied for a security clearance in June 2018 after \nanother period of unemployment, he had a number of delinquent accounts, some of which \nhad been placed for collections. (Tr. at 31-33.) \n \n\n4 \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.c, Three Student Loans Placed for Collection in the Total Amount of \n$25,325 \u2013 Applicant has outstanding student loans for his daughter\u2019s education and for \nhis more recent education. He claimed in his SOR answer that he has made payments \nand is \u201cno longer delinquent.\u201d He is presently paying about $800 each month directly out \nof his paycheck, as evidenced by the two leave and earning statements he submitted into \nthe record. These loans will be fully repaid in two or three years. These debts are being \nresolved. (AE F; AE G; AE H; Tr. at 35-36, 63.) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 2.f, 2.g, 2.h., Credit Card Accounts Placed for Collection or Charged-\nOff in the Total Amount of $5,893 - The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d ($3,715) is for a \ncredit card account opened in December 2013. Applicant wrote in his SOR answer that \nhe learned about this collection account when he returned from his deployment in a war \nzone in November 2013. He testified that he tried to reach the bank when he returned \nfrom the war zone and learned that the debt had been transferred to a collection agency. \nHe never heard anything further about this account. Applicant intends to pay his \noutstanding debts pursuant to a plan discussed below. This debt will be resolved pursuant \nto his repayment plan. (GE 3 at 2; GE 7 at 2-3; Tr. at 35-37.) \n \n \nThe credit-card debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.f ($1,224) and \u00b6 2.g ($1,098) are the \nsame debt owed to the same bank. The debt is listed twice in Applicant\u2019s credit reports \nand in the SOR because the bank changed its name. Applicant has made payments on \nthis debt. Applicant Exhibit J, dated August 26, 2019, evidences five payments on the \naccount of $100 each. This debt is being resolved or has already been resolved. (GE 2; \nAE J; Tr. at 37-38, 56-57, 66.) \n \n \nThe credit-card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.h ($1,080) was opened in December \n2013 and became delinquent about a year later. Applicant testified that he contacted the \ncreditor and was advised that the debt was charged off and would be treated as income \nto Applicant for tax purposes. He believes that he included this debt as income on his tax \nreturns and owes nothing further. This debt will be resolved pursuant to his repayment \nplan. (Tr. at 38-40.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e, Consumer Retail Account Placed for Collection in the Amount of $1,576 \n\u2013 This debt was transferred to a collection agency. The agency obtained a judgment \nagainst Applicant in October 2017. Applicant never received any correspondence or court \npapers from the creditor, either before the judgment or after. This debt will be resolved \npursuant to his repayment plan. (GE 2; Tr. at 37.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.i, Consumer Retail Account Charged-Off in the Amount of $553 \u2013 This \naccount was opened in 2012. Applicant defaulted on the payment of this account in about \nJune 2015. Applicant testified that he is unfamiliar with this debt. This debt will be resolved \npursuant to his repayment plan. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. at 40.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.j, Account Placed for Collection in the Amount of $1,295 \u2013 Government \nExhibit 4 established this collection debt. Applicant testified that he is unfamiliar with this \ndebt. This debt will be resolved pursuant to his repayment plan. (GE 4 at 6; Tr. at 42.) \n\n5 \n \nAfter his background interview, Applicant called his creditors, but he learned that they \nno longer owned the accounts. He could not figure out which company was the correct owner \nof his debt, and which the legal creditor. Applicant testified that he has sought advice from a \nfinancial counselor who has created a repayment plan to address the unresolved debts in the \nSOR. Applicant has decided to delay implementing the plan until he knows whether he has \nbeen granted a security clearance before he commits to repaying his debts. He is concerned \nthat if his application is denied, he will lose his employment and be unable to honor his \ncommitment to repay his creditors. He also wants to preserve the available income from his \nwife\u2019s employment and his military retirement to pay his mortgage and car payment should \nhe become unemployed again. He credibly testified that if his clearance was granted, he \nwould begin making the payments pursuant to the counselor\u2019s repayment plan. Applicant\u2019s \nattorney represented that he possessed a single copy of the plan, which he would submit \nafter the hearing. The plan was not included in the post-hearing submission by Applicant\u2019s \nlaw firm. I note that his attorney separated from that law firm shortly after the hearing and \nbefore the post-hearing submission was made. (Tr. at 40-42, 65, 72, 79.) \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant responded to the falsification allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a by \nwriting that he did not understand the question involved. He noted that English is not his \nnative language. Also, he was unaware that he had any delinquent debts. At the hearing, \nhe clarified that the main reason for his incorrect response to the financial question in the \nSCA was that he thought he had no delinquent debts. His wife played the major role in \npaying household bills. He first learned about the debts during his background interview. \nHe then checked his credit for the first time. He credibly denied that he intentionally \nprovided a false answer. (SOR answer at 8; Tr. at 42-43, 62, 65-72, 78.) \n \nThe Philippines  \n \nThe U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution \nwhen traveling to the Philippines due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest. The State \nDepartment advises that there is considerable risk of terrorism in the country. Terrorist \norganizations and criminal gangs operate throughout the country. Some groups are allied \nwith the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham, also known as ISIS. The organizations and \ngangs conduct bombing attacks and kidnappings against foreigners, civilians, \ngovernment institutions, and security forces.  \n \n \nThere are significant human rights problems in the Philippines, including unlawful \nand arbitrary killings by security forces, vigilantes, and insurgents. Other human rights \nconcerns \nraised \nby \nactions \nof \ngovernment \nrepresentatives \ninclude \nforced \ndisappearances, torture, arbitrary detention, harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, \npolitical detentions, killings and threats against journalists, official corruption, and abuse \nof power. Law enforcement agencies are engaged in a nationwide counter-narcotics \ncampaign that has resulted in a sharp increase in violence between police and individuals \nsuspected of involvement in the drug trade.  \n \n \n\n6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n7 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response, in his testimony, and the \ndocumentary evidence in the record, potentially establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n\n8 \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) require evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nnecessary to raise these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened \nrisk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living \nunder a foreign government. The totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as \nwell as each individual family tie must be considered.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother and sister and his mother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nthe Philippines. Applicant and his wife have ties of affection to each of them. He maintains \ncontact with these relatives, and his wife maintains contact with her mother.  \n \nThe mere possession of a close personal relationship with a person, who is a \ncitizen and resident of a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under \nGuideline B. However, depending on the facts and circumstances, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence or a conflict of interest and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information.  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, the general conditions under which the \ncitizens and residents of that country live, and the human-rights record of the country\u2019s \ngovernment are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members \nare vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, persuasion, \nor duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government; \nthe government ignores the rule of law including widely accepted civil liberties; a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government; the government is \nengaged in a counterinsurgency actions; terrorists cause a substantial amount of death \nor property damage; or the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations \nagainst the United States. The country conditions in the Philippines place a significant, \nbut not insurmountable, burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nrelationships with his family members living in that country do not pose a security risk to \nthe United States. Applicant should not be placed a position where he might be forced to \nchoose between his loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative living in \nthe Philippines.  \n \nWhile there is no evidence in the record that intelligence operatives or terrorists \nfrom the Philippines seek or have sought classified or economic information from or \nthrough Applicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility \nin the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and the Philippines has a serious \nproblem with terrorism. Applicant\u2019s relationships with relatives living in the Philippines \ncreate a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on his family \nliving there in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified information. These \nrelationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Substantial evidence was produced of Applicant\u2019s contacts with \nfamily in the Philippines and has raised issues of a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion and the potential for a conflict of interest. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  \n \n\n9 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant has not established mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a). The nature of his \nrelationships with his relatives in the Philippines, as alleged in the SOR, especially his \nrelationship with his brother who is employed by the government in a law enforcement \ncapacity, preclude a conclusion that it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position \nof having to choose between the interests of his foreign relatives and the interests of the \nUnited States.  \n \n \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b), however, has been fully established. Applicant has \nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States that he can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. Applicant \nhonorably served in the Marine Corps for 20 years. He joined the Marines before he even \nbecame a U.S. citizen. He has worked for U.S. Government contractors since his \nretirement from the Marines. Altogether, he has been providing critical logistical support \nfor the U.S. warfighter for 35 years. Having immigrated to this country at the age of 19, \nhe has lived most of his adult life in this country. In addition, his wife and children are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens. His wife has lived in the United States most of her adult life and \nthe children of Applicant and his wife have lived in this country most of their lives. Also, \nApplicant\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to his foreign relatives and to the Philippines as \na country and its government is so minimal that no conflict of interest exists.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is also established. Applicant\u2019s contacts and communications with his \nrelatives is casual and infrequent so as to create little likelihood that those relationships \ncould create a risk of foreign influence or exploitation. He has not visited his family in the \nPhilippines since 2003, and then he only went there to bury his deceased father. \n \n\n10 \n \n \nSecurity concerns alleged in the SOR under Guideline B are resolved in favor of \nApplicant. Accordingly, paragraph 1 of the SOR is found for him. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response, his testimony, and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline for the eleven SOR allegations:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n\n11 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAll of the above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s debts became delinquent \ndue to the unusual circumstance of his prolonged periods of unemployment, totaling 28 \nmonths over the last five years. He is hopeful that his current employment will continue \nuninterrupted without any further breaks due to contract expirations. It is unlikely that he \nwill incur any significant, additional delinquent debt should he become unemployed in the \nfuture since he has learned that he must stay in close contact with his creditors and work \nout repayment plans in the event of a loss of income. In any event, his behavior does not \ncast doubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nApplicant has established that his delinquencies were due to circumstances \nbeyond his control. He has provided significant evidence that he has acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. He presently is repaying his most significant debts both from \nthe standpoint of security significance and size. The student loan debts owed to the U.S \nGovernment alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.c total $25,325. He is paying about $800 \nper month on these debts through a payroll deduction. The loans will be repaid in less \nthan three years. Applicant also established that he has paid a fourth debt (SOR \u00b6 2.f), \nwhich is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g.  \n \nThe five remaining debts alleged in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 2.e, 2.h, 2.i, and 2.j) \ntotal about $8,200. While this is not a small amount, the adjudicative guidelines do not \nrequire that an applicant be debt free. The Appeal Board has established the following \nbasic guidance for adjudications in cases such as this: \n \n[A]n applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which the applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payments of such debts one at a time. ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotations omitted). \n \nWhen considering the entirety of Applicant\u2019s financial situation, his extensive, \nrecent history of unemployment, and his actions, I view that Applicant has acted \nreasonably. He is initially resolving his three federal debts for student loans and a fourth \ndebt owed to a bank. He has initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. \n \nApplicant has taken a pragmatic approach to the repayment of the five other debts \nalleged in the SOR. He has organized a plan of action with a professional counselor. The \n\n12 \n \ncautious timing for implementing the plan obviously is the result of his experiences of \ndealing with the hardships of losing his employment in the past. He intends to commence \npayments under the plan if his security clearance is renewed and he is permitted to \ncontinue working for his government contractor. His total outstanding debts is a relatively \nsmall amount. It will not take long for him to repay these debts under his plan.  \n \nSecurity concerns alleged in the SOR under Guideline F are resolved in favor of \nApplicant. Accordingly, paragraph 2 of the SOR is found for him. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nThe following potentially disqualifying condition under this guideline in implicated \nby the SOR allegations under this adjudicative guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n \nThe Government has the initial burden of establishing by substantial evidence that \nApplicant intentionally omitted potentially derogatory information about his delinquent \ndebts from the SCA. Throughout his 20 years in the Marine Corps, Applicant was often \ndeployed and away from home. His wife ran their household, raised their children, and \npaid their bills. He was aware of the student loans and a bank debt and believed they \nwere being paid in a timely manner. At the time he prepared the SCA, he had no \nknowledge that they were delinquent. He also did not know about the other accounts.  \n \nOf course, it is desirable that applicants for security clearances have a firm grasp \nof their financial obligations, and when faced with unemployment, take affirmative steps \nto deal with their creditors. But that ideal is not everyone\u2019s reality. Applicant should have \nknown more about his delinquent obligations when he prepared the SCA. He should have \ndiscussed his financial obligations with his wife and reviewed a credit report, but he did \nnot do so. Applicant prepared the SCA with the limited information he possessed, and his \ndisclosure about his finances were incorrect. He credibly testified that he did not \nintentionally omit his delinquent debts from the SCA. I conclude that the record does not \n\n13 \n \ncontain substantial evidence that Applicant intentionally provided false information in the \nSCA.  \n \nSecurity concerns alleged in the SOR under Guideline E are resolved in favor of \nApplicant. Accordingly, paragraph 3 of the SOR is found for him. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B, F, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed above, but other factors warrant additional comment. I have \nheavily weighed Applicant\u2019s 20 years of honorable service in the Marine Corps. I have \nalso weighed his additional 15 years providing logistical support to the U.S. military as a \ncontractor. His work throughout his adult life has been in service of the United States. As \npart of his employment as a contractor, he has had the unfortunate experience of losing \nhis job when his employers\u2019 contracts with DOD terminated. His 28 months of \nunemployment over the last five years had a significant impact of his life. He has an \nexcellent position at this time. He has earned the right to show that he can promptly repay \nhis outstanding debts pursuant to his counselor\u2019s repayment plan. Moreover, Applicant is \nan honorable man with much integrity and pride. He would not mislead the U.S. \nGovernment or do any damage to this country, his adopted country, which he has served \nfor so many years. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B, F, \nand E, and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by the allegations in the SOR. \n \n \n \n \n\n14 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.j: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Personal Conduct:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interests to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n07/01/2020 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant refuted the personal conduct security concerns, but failed to mitigate \nthe foreign influence, and drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 19, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines B, foreign influence, E, personal conduct, and H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered some of the SOR allegations on September 10, 2019, and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department \nCounsel repeatedly requested that Applicant provide answers to the allegations he \n\n \n2 \n \nneglected to answer in the SOR. Applicant failed to respond to the requests. \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and \nit was received by Applicant on April 13, 2020. He was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of \nreceipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 11. \nApplicant did not provide a response to the FORM or object to the Government\u2019s \nevidence. Items 1 through 11 are admitted. The case was assigned to me on June 11, \n2020.  \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Afghanistan. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not \nbe repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the significant threat of \nterrorism and ongoing human rights problems in Afghanistan. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, 2.b, and 3.a, with \nexplanations. He failed to respond to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e, which \nwill be considered denials. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. He was born in Afghanistan. He married in 2005 and \nmoved to the United States in 2007 on a spousal visa. His wife is a naturalized citizen of \nthe United States. He became a naturalized citizen in 2011. He has two children born in \nthe United States, ages nine and five years old. He resides in a home he owns. He has \nworked for a federal contractor as a linguist assigned to Afghanistan from July 2018 to \nat least the date of his answer to the SOR. He also previously worked for a federal \ncontractor as a linguist from April 2010 to February 2013, assigned to Afghanistan. \nApplicant was self-employed during other periods. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother, sister, half-brother, and two half-sisters are citizens and \nresidents of Afghanistan. His brother is 65 years old and retired from the Afghan Army \nin 1988. Applicant stated in his SOR Answer that his brother quit the Army due to unfair \ncircumstances. He stated his brother receives a partial mental disability pension. He has \nquarterly telephonic or electronic contact with him. Applicant did not disclose his sister\u2019s \nemployment or means of support. He has monthly telephonic contact with her. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s half-brother is a university student in Afghanistan. Applicant has \nmonthly telephonic and electronic contact with him. Both of Applicant\u2019s half-sisters are \nteachers employed by the Ministry of Education. Applicant has quarterly telephonic or \nelectronic contact with them. (Item 3) \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s October 30, 2018 interview with a government investigator, he \ndisclosed he visited his family in Afghanistan in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and from \nDecember 2017 to January 2018. This information was not included in his October 5, \n2018 security clearance application (SCA). He also disclosed that he sends money \n\n \n3 \n \nquarterly to his half-brother in Afghanistan. In the past, Applicant provided financial \nsupport to his brother, sister, and half-brother in Afghanistan. (Items 4, 7) \n \n \nIn the past, Applicant provided about $15,000 in financial support to his nephew, \nwho is a dual citizenship of Afghanistan and the United Kingdom (UK), and currently \nlives in the UK. (Item 3) \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s \nOctober 2018 Counterintelligence Focused Security \nScreening Questionnaire (CIFSSQ), he was asked if there is any country he had \nallegiance to over the United States. He responded that the United States is his country, \nbut he is also loyal to the UK because he has family there, and he is also loyal to \nAfghanistan. He would like to live in Europe and have his children grow up with his \nfamily\u2019s children, because they are lonely in the United States, but believes that is not \npossible. He confirmed that he is more loyal to the United States. (Item 4) \n \n \n \nIn April 2010, Applicant completed a CIFSSQ. In it he disclosed that in 2004 he \nused marijuana two to three times while living in the UK, but had not used it since that \ntime. (Item 6) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2012 CIFSSQ, he disclosed that he used marijuana once per \nweek when he lived in the UK and his last use was in 2005. (Item 5) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s August 2018 CIFSSQ, he disclosed he had used marijuana about \ntwice a week from 2016 to 2018 while living in the United States. He used it because it \nwas fun and stopped using it because he did not want his use to affect his employment \nwith U.S. Forces. He stated he never thought about the illegality of his use.  \n \nOn his October 5, 2018 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant \nanswered \u201cno\u201d in response to the question if he had in the last seven years illegally \nused drugs. (Item 3) \n \nIn his October 2018 interview with a government investigator, Applicant said he \nused marijuana a total of five to six times with his nephew in the U.S. from 2017 to the \npresent. Whenever his nephew obtained marijuana, they smoked it to relax. Applicant \nwas attempting to quit smoking and used marijuana in its place. He told the investigator \nthat he did not disclose his drug use on his SCA because he believed his use was now \nlegal, and he had no intention to use it in the future due to its potential impact on his \neligibility to hold a job with U.S. Forces. He told the investigator that he had used \nmarijuana from 2004 to 2008 once or twice a month with a nephew while he was in the \nUK. (Items 4, 7) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer he stated:  \n \nIt was a big mistake made by me and that happened due to ignorance and \nlack of knowledge about the drug classifications. Honestly speaking one of \nmy friends mentioned to me that marijuana is legally allowed in [State A], \nso while living in [State A] it was revolving in my mind that once it is legally \n\n \n4 \n \nallowed it might not be counted [as] illegal drugs, so due to the ignorance \nthe word \u201cno\u201d uttered from my mouth on (e-QIP). (Item 2) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in \nAfghanistan. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion, through his contact with his family members there. Applicant maintains close \ncontact with them. The above disqualifying conditions have been raised by the \nevidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) that nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \n\n \n6 \n \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Afghanistan. The nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government; a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government; the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States; or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant has been a U.S. citizen since 2011. His immediate family, to include his \nwife and two children, are citizens and residents of the United States. He also owns a \nhome in the U.S. Applicant also has close ties to his brother, sister, half-brother, and \ntwo half-sisters, who are residents and citizens of Afghanistan. He maintains regular \ncontact with them and visits them annually. He provides financial support to his family in \nAfghanistan. The evidence provided by Applicant is sparse and limited. Although \nApplicant has significant ties to the United States, he also has significant and ongoing \nties with his relatives in Afghanistan, and there is insufficient evidence to conclude that \nhe would resolve a conflict of interest in favor of the United States. Applicant failed to \nprovide sufficient evidence to conclude that he is unlikely to be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between his relatives in Afghanistan and the interests of the United \nStates. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s contact with his family in \nAfghanistan is casual and infrequent. The evidence does not establish mitigation under \nany of the mitigating conditions.  \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG & 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \n\n \n7 \n \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from approximately 2004 to \n2008 and from 2016 to sometime in 2018. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nApplicant has a history of marijuana use and stated his last use was in mid-2018. \nIn his September 2019 answer to the SOR, he stated he does not intend to use it in the \nfuture. Applicant frequently used marijuana with his nephew who supplied the drug. He \nprovided inconsistent responses to his frequency of use. There is no evidence he has \ndisassociated from his nephew or discussed his intention not to use marijuana with him \nin the future. No evidence was provided to confirm that Applicant has changed or \navoided the environment where drugs are used or if he has continued to abstain from \nmarijuana use. Due to Applicant\u2019s long history of marijuana use and recent commitment \n\n \n8 \n \nto abstinence, there is insufficient evidence to conclude future use is unlikely to recur. \nUnder these circumstances, I cannot find that his use was infrequent, happened under \nunique circumstances, or does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. There is no evidence of completion of a drug treatment program. \nThere is insufficient evidence to fully apply the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \n26(b) and 26(d). \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his past drug use. \nApplicant stated that because the use of marijuana was legal in the state where he \nlived, he thought he was not required to disclose his use. Applicant also disclosed his \ndrug use to the Government in his August 2018 CIFSSQ. I find this is a credible \nexplanation for his failure to disclose this information, and he did not deliberately omit \nthis information from his SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) has not been established. SOR \u00b6 3.a is \nconcluded for Applicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n9 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B, H, and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant has significant ties to the United States and also significant ties to his \nfamily in Afghanistan. The complicated state of affairs in Afghanistan places a \nsignificant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his foreign family \nmembers do not pose an unacceptable security risk. He has not met that burden. \nApplicant\u2019s long history of drug use does not outweigh his recent assertions that he is \nabstaining from drug use.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant refuted \nthe personal conduct security concerns, but failed to mitigate the foreign influence and \ndrug involvement and substance misuse security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Government Exhibit 1.) On June 17, 2019, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol \nConsumption), F (Financial Considerations), and E (Personal Conduct). The actions were \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense \nafter June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on June 26, 2019, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non August 29, 2019. The case was assigned to me on October 3, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on October 4, 2019. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled on November 7, 2019. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through C, which were also \nadmitted without objection. Applicant requested that the record remain open for the \nreceipt of additional documentation. No additional information was submitted. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 19, 2019.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant was born in Somalia in 1963. He immigrated to the United States in 1984, \nand became a U.S. citizen in 1992. He has a co-habitant, and one adult child from a prior \nmarriage. Applicant has a high school diploma and some college. He is seeking to obtain \nnational security eligibility in connection with a prospective job as a linguist with the DoD. \nApplicant is conversant in several languages, but English is not his first language, as \nshown in the transcript. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. (Government \nExhibit 1 at Sections 9, 12, 13.)  \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he uses intoxicants to excess. Applicant had a severe alcohol problem for many \nyears. He began drinking in 1982. He began drinking heavily in 1995. (Government \nExhibit 3 at 11-12; Tr. at 69.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol problem resulted in several alcohol-related arrests, as set forth \nbelow: \n \n \n 1.a. Applicant was first arrested for DUI in April 1997. The available records do \nnot show a disposition. Applicant does not have an accurate recollection of the disposition \nof this case. (Government Exhibit 3 at 9-10, Exhibit 5 at 5; Tr. at 24-25.) \n \n \n 1.b. Applicant was arrested for DUI a second time in September 1998. The \navailable records do not show a disposition. Applicant does not have an accurate \nrecollection of the disposition of this case. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10, Exhibit 5 at 5; Tr. \nat 25.) \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \n1.c. Applicant was arrested a third time for DUI in November 2004. He was \nconvicted and sentenced to one day in jail, probation for three years, and a fine. Applicant \ntestified that he completed all the requirements of his sentence. (Government Exhibit 5 at \n2; Tr. at 26-27.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant was again arrested for DUI in December 2006. The available records \ndo not show a disposition. Applicant believes that this case was either vacated or \ndismissed. He further stated that he had not been drinking on the date in question. \n(Government Exhibit 3 at 8, Exhibit 5 at 5; Tr. at 28.) \n \n \n1.e. Applicant was arrested for Extreme DUI and Failure to Stop at an Accident \nScene in January 2007. Applicant did not resolve this arrest in a timely fashion and an \narrest warrant was issued. He resolved this case in 2013, along with the offense in \nallegation 1.h. The sentence included jail for 90 days, probation for three years, a fine, \ncommunity service and restitution. (Government Exhibit 3 at 9, Exhibit 5 at 5-6; Tr. at 28-\n30, 37.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was also suspended for two years as a result of this \ncase and 1.h. At the end of that time, approximately 2015, Applicant had to have an \nignition interlock device installed in his car. The device was originally supposed to be in \nhis car for three years. However, due to two incidents involving Applicant and his vehicle, \nthe time was extended by an additional two years. The device was still on his car at the \ntime of the hearing. Applicant has a current driver\u2019s license, which was reviewed by this \nadministrative judge, confirming that Applicant was restricted to driving vehicles with an \ninterlock device. (Tr. at 46-52, 71-73.)  \n \n \n1.f. Applicant was again arrested for DUI in March 2008. The available records do \nnot show a disposition. Applicant does not have an accurate recollection of the disposition \nof this case. (Government Exhibit 5 at 3; Tr. at 30.) \n \n \n1.g. Applicant was arrested for Disorderly Conduct While Intoxicated in April 2008. \nThe records show he was convicted and paid a fine. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10, Exhibit \n5 at 3; Tr. at 30-31.) \n \n \n1.h. Applicant was arrested for extreme DUI in February 2010. He failed to appear \nand a warrant was issued. Applicant testified that he found out about the warrants in this \ncase and allegation 1.e in 2013, at that time he went to court and resolved both cases. \nThe sentence included jail for 90 days, probation for three years, a fine, community \nservice and restitution. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10-11, Exhibit 5 at 6; Tr. at 31-37.) \n \n \nAccording to Applicant, the 2010 arrest for extreme DUI occurred because he was \nhaving an epileptic seizure after drinking. He testified that police took him to the hospital, \nwhere he was diagnosed with diabetes. At that time Applicant did not know he was \nsuffering from diabetes. Because of his diabetes diagnosis, Applicant made the decision \nto stop drinking alcohol for health reasons. As of the date of the hearing he had not had \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nanything to drink in approximately nine years. He submitted a laboratory report dated \nOctober 18, 2019. That report stated Applicant had no alcohol in his system, and that he \nhad diabetic levels of blood sugar. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10-11; Applicant Exhibit C; \nTr. at 32-33, 37-39.)  \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline F: Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore potentially \nunreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he did not filed his 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 Federal \nand state income tax returns in a timely fashion. He submitted documentation showing \nthat the subject tax returns were all filed in 2018. (Government Exhibit 2; Applicant \nExhibits A and B.) \n \n \nFor many years Applicant has owned a small business in the United States. \nAccording to Applicant he was unable to complete his tax returns in a timely manner \nbecause of the actions of his business partner, who did not provide timely information to \nApplicant. In addition, Applicant was making a minimal income in the United States during \nthose years and he wrongfully believed he did not need to file a tax return. Applicant is in \nthe midst of closing down the partnership so as to avoid any future problems. (Tr. 39-42, \n44, 52-65.) \n \n \nIn addition to operating his state-side business, Applicant was living and working \noutside the United States during 2014, 2015, and 2017. That fact made it difficult for him \nto communicate with his business partner and his tax preparer. In 2018 Applicant decided \nit was time to file all of his missing tax returns. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 11, \nExhibit 4.) \n \n \nAvailable records show that Applicant\u2019s 2017 tax returns were filed, albeit late. In \naddition, as of the date of the hearing, Applicant had yet to file his 2018 income tax \nreturns. He was uncertain of the status of those tax returns, and was unable to provide a \ntime frame in which they would be filed. (Tr. 43-44.) \n \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E: Personal Conduct) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant has engaged in conduct \nthat shows questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, dishonesty, and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nAllegation 3.a states that Applicant\u2019s conduct under paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR \nare cognizable under this paragraph as well. \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \nAllegation 3.b concerns an arrest of Applicant in December 2010 for Driving with \na Forged or Counterfeit Driver\u2019s License, Driving While License Suspended, and No \nVehicle Registration. He was convicted and sentenced to three days in jail and probation \nfor three years. Applicant was stopped by police and presented his brother\u2019s driver\u2019s \nlicense, since Applicant\u2019s driving privileges had been suspended. Applicant admitted that \nhe had been driving on an occasional basis during the time his license had been \nsuspended. He stopped this conduct in approximately 2013. (Government Exhibit 3 at 12, \nExhibit 5 at 3-4; Tr. 45-46, 65-69.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven disqualifying conditions that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions possibly apply to the facts \nin this case: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \nApplicant had a long history of drinking to excess, as shown by the eight alcohol-\nrelated incidents set forth in the SOR and discussed above. The last incident was in \nFebruary 2010. Applicant stopped drinking at that time. Both of the cited conditions apply.   \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains two conditions that could mitigate alcohol \nconsumption security concerns:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or \njudgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \n \n \nBoth of the mitigating conditions apply to this case. There is no doubt Applicant \nhad a severe alcohol problem for many years. However, his last alcohol-related arrest \nwas in 2010. He stopped using alcohol in 2010 because of health issues, and credibly \ntestified that he has not had anything to drink since that time. Nine years of sobriety is \nsufficient to show that Applicant has mitigated the security significance of his prior alcohol \nissues. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline F: Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes several conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n \n \nApplicant failed to file Federal or state income tax returns, as required, for tax years \n2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing \ndisqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant was dilatory in filing tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2016. All the \nreturns referenced in the SOR were filed in 2018, before the pendency of this case. I have \nconsidered the fact that Applicant\u2019s 2018 tax returns had not been filed as of the date of \nthe hearing. Under the particular facts of this case, including his business partnership and \nthe fact that the other returns have all been filed, I find that fact to be of minimal concern. \nMitigating conditions \u00b6\u00b6 20 (a), (b), and (g) apply. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \n \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E: Personal Conduct) \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which reads in pertinent part:  \n \n   Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n   \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes several conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n  \n(1) untrustworthy, or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s \ntime or resources; and \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, his failure to file tax returns for several years, \nand his presenting false identification to law enforcement officers, all amounts to wrongful \npersonal conduct. The burden then shifts to Applicant to overcome these allegations. \n \n \nAG \u00b617 sets forth the possible mitigating conditions. Two apply to the facts in this \ncase: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant had a history of inappropriate alcohol-related behavior for several years, \nending in 2010. In addition, he also misrepresented himself to a police officer in 2010. \nFinally, he did not file his tax returns in a timely fashion. However, Applicant has been \nworking diligently at improving himself. He has not had anything to drink for over nine \nyears, all of the subject tax returns have been filed, and he credibly testified that he \nunderstands the importance of continued obedience to all laws going forward. Both of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Paragraph 3 is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity significance of his alcohol-related incidents, failure to file tax returns, and other \nincidents of concern. Enough time has passed to establish confidence that recurrence is \nunlikely. Overall, the record evidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant=s \npresent suitability for national security eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 47-year-old desk side support technician employed by a defense contractor since March 2019. He has been employed in similar positions since February 2001. He seeks to retain the clearance he was first issued in June 1997. He claims that his job does not require access to classified information. The SOR alleges, Government exhibits 1-6 substantiate, and Applicant admits five delinquent debts totaling over $160,000. The debts comprise nearly $67,000 in three consumer debts owed to the same creditor, and over $94,000 in delinquent state and Federal income taxes. His Federal tax liability covers tax years 2011-2018; his state tax liability covers tax years 2012, 2014-2015, and 2017-2018. He has been married for 18 years and has no children. Applicant reported the delinquent Federal income taxes on his June 2018 clearance application (GE 1). He discussed the SOR debts during interviews with a Government investigator in September 2017 and in September and October 2018. Applicant acknowledged the delinquent debts. He claimed to be making monthly payments on his state and Federal taxes, but had not made any payment arrangements on the consumer debts (GE 2). In his May 2019 response to DOHA interrogatories (GE 2), he stated he had a repayment plan for his state taxes but not for his Federal taxes.

White, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n08/04/2020 \n______________\nDecision \nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: \nBased on the record in this case [transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-6, \nhearing exhibit (HE) I, and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-C], I deny Applicant=s clearance. The \nrecord closed 26 November 2019, when Department Counsel stated no objection to AE \nC. \nOn 19 July 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations.1 \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 1 October 2019 and I \nconvened a hearing 30 October 2019. DOHA received the transcript 13 November 2019. \n1DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on \n8 June 2017. \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 47-year-old desk side support \ntechnician employed by a defense contractor since March 2019. He has been employed \nin similar positions since February 2001. He seeks to retain the clearance he was first \nissued in June 1997. He claims that his job does not require access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThe SOR alleges, Government exhibits 1-6 substantiate, and Applicant admits five \ndelinquent debts totaling over $160,000. The debts comprise nearly $67,000 in three \nconsumer debts owed to the same creditor, and over $94,000 in delinquent state and \nFederal income taxes. His Federal tax liability covers tax years 2011-2018; his state tax \nliability covers tax years 2012, 2014-2015, and 2017-2018. He has been married for 18 \nyears and has no children. \n \nApplicant reported the delinquent Federal income taxes on his June 2018 \nclearance application (GE 1). He discussed the SOR debts during interviews with a \nGovernment investigator in September 2017 and in September and October 2018. \nApplicant acknowledged the delinquent debts. He claimed to be making monthly \npayments on his state and Federal taxes, but had not made any payment arrangements \non the consumer debts (GE 2). In his May 2019 response to DOHA interrogatories (GE \n2), he stated he had a repayment plan for his state taxes but not for his Federal taxes. \nHis tax transcripts for tax years 2011-2018 show no Federal tax payments aside from the \nseizure of his income tax refunds (GE 3). AE A reflects a series of payments to the state \ntax authority between August 2016 and October 2019, but does not indicate the status of \nthe account. AE B reflects that as of October 2019, Applicant had hired a financial \nservices company to address derogatory/frivolous items on his credit report, but that SOR \ndebts 1.a-1.c had yet to be addressed. AE C reflects that Applicant last made a payment \non his state taxes in November 2019, reducing his outstanding balance for tax years 2015 \nand 2017 to about $5,900. \n \nApplicant attributed his tax issues to his wife not having adequate income tax \nwithholding taken from her earnings. They file joint taxes, but otherwise manage their \nfinances separately. However, he documented no efforts to address that issue for the \neight years at issue for his Federal taxes and the five years at issue for his state taxes. \nHe attributed his consumer debt problems to his wife not helping him with the commercial \ncredit obligations he undertook. His new job pays $76,000 annually; his previous salary \nwas $68,000 (Tr. 25). \n \nIn addition to not providing any evidence of efforts to deal with the specific SOR \ndebts except for his state taxes, Applicant has not received any credit or financial \ncounseling. The financial services company he hired has been dealing with credit report \nentries not alleged in the SOR. He does not have a budget. He provided no work or \ncharacter references, or any evidence of community involvement. \n \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person=s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.2 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant had five delinquent debts \ntotaling over $160,000 that he has not acted upon since at least 2017, except for the state \ntax liability at SOR 1.e.3 \n \nThe mitigating conditions for financial considerations provide insufficient help to \nApplicant. The conduct was recent, frequent, and the circumstances are likely to recur.4 \nThe circumstances of his financial problems were certainly within his control, he has not \ndocumented that his overall approach to resolving his debts has been responsible, \n                                                 \n2See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3&19(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; \n4&20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . .  \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nshowing only payments on his state tax liability, and no communications regarding his \nFederal tax liability or his consumer debt.5        \n \nApplicant has not had credit and financial counseling, and has no budget. There is \nno evidence that his financial problems have been resolved or are under control.6 This \nfailure of evidence precludes a conclusion that Applicant has made a good-faith effort to \naddress his debts because he cannot show substantial evidence that he is adhering to \nhis effort.7 Moreover, he provided no character evidence to support a whole-person \nassessment to overcome the security concerns raised by his current financial situation. I \nconclude Guideline F against Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs a-d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nClearance denied.   \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n________________________ \nJOHN GRATTAN METZ, JR \nAdministrative Judge \n                                                 \n5&20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control . . . \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6&20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . .  and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n7&20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. \n",

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Appellant: Pro se \nFebruary 19, 2020 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines F (financial \nconsiderations) and H (drug involvement and substance misuse). Applicant has made \narrangements to pay all of his state taxes for the years 2013 through 2015. He had \npreviously filed his state and federal tax returns, as required. He has resolved his \ndelinquent medical and consumer debts. In addition, he stopped using marijuana in 2017 \nand has expressed a credible intent not to use it in the future. Applicant provided \nsignificant evidence in mitigation. National security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January, 20, 2017, Applicant filed a security clearance application (SCA). The \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on May 24, 2019, setting forth 11 allegations under \nGuideline F and six allegations under Guideline H. The DOD CAF acted under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as \n\n2 \n \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), effective for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, \n2017. \n \nOn June 25, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR. He requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn July 25, 2019, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nSeptember 5, 2019, scheduling the hearing for September 25, 2019.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented eight \nproposed exhibits. I marked her exhibits as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 and \nher exhibit list as Hearing Exhibit 1. Applicant offered three exhibits, which I marked as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through C. Applicant also submitted duplicate copies of certain \nexhibits that were more readable than the original documents attached to his SOR \nanswer. I kept these documents in the record for convenience purposes and have marked \nthem together as Hearing Exhibit 2.  \n \nI kept the record open until October 9, 2019, to give both parties the opportunity to \nsubmit additional evidence. On October 4, 2019, Applicant emailed five additional \nexhibits, which I have marked as AE D through H. In his email, he provided material \ninformation of an evidentiary nature. Accordingly, I have marked his email as AE I.  \n \nOn October 7, 2019, Department Counsel wrote in an email that she had provided \nDOHA\u2019s staff with a physical copy of a post-hearing exhibit for mailing to Applicant and \nme. She wrote in her email that the exhibit may not be received until after the deadline, \nbut requested that I consider the submission to be timely filed. The proposed exhibit \nconsists of a number of pages and is not easily scanned. Applicant responded with a \ncomplaint about Department Counsel\u2019s timing. I advised him that I considered \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s submission to be timely under the circumstances, and in fairness \nto Applicant, I extended the deadline for him to supplement the record until October 16, \n2019. He provided no additional evidence. I have marked the email correspondence \nrelated to this extension as Hearing Exhibit 3. I have marked Department Counsel\u2019s post-\nhearing submission as GE 9.  \n \nI admitted all exhibits into the record. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non October 11, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant denied that he failed to file his 2016 and 2017 federal \nand state tax returns as required, but he admitted that he owed state taxes. He also \nadmitted the eight other debts alleged in the SOR under Guideline F. Under Guideline H, \nhe admitted five of the six allegations regarding his history using marijuana, but denied \nthat he intended to continue using marijuana in the future (SOR \u00b6 2.c). I have incorporated \n\n3 \n \nhis admissions in my findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from \nhis SCA unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, and \nthe documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant, 51, has worked as a senior consultant for a Federal Government \ncontractor since 2014 and earns a significant salary. Prior to that he worked for another \ngovernment contractor for eight years. He has held a security clearance since at least \n2006. Applicant earned an associate\u2019s degree and a bachelor\u2019s degree. He started \ncollege at age 14 and earned his bachelor\u2019s degree at age 19. He has been married since \n1998, and they have a 15-year-old child. Applicant also has two adult stepchildren. (Tr. \n62-65.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife have experienced serious medical issues in recent years \nand have incurred large medical bills that have strained their finances. In his 2017 SCA, \nApplicant disclosed certain debts of which he was aware. He also disclosed his history of \nusing marijuana while holding a security clearance and three arrests for minor drug \noffenses during the period 2002 through 2007. (Tr. 35-56, 87-88.) \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, Failure to File 2016 and 2017 Federal and State Tax Returns as \nRequired - Applicant denies these allegations. He attached to his SOR answer copies of \nhis 2016 and 2017 federal and state income tax returns, which he wrote were timely filed. \nAfter the hearing, he provided federal tax return transcripts for both years. The transcripts \nestablish that he and his wife timely filed their federal returns and received refunds in both \nyears. Applicant has refuted these SOR allegations as erroneous. The basis of the \nallegations is a miscommunication during his background interview and an error in the \ninvestigator\u2019s report of investigation. (GE 2 at 4-5; AE D, AE E; Tr. 27, 37-40.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, State Tax Debt in the approximate amount of $9,000 for Tax Years 2013-\n2015 \u2013 Applicant admits this allegation, but states that in June 2018 he has entered into \na payment plan to pay $500 per month to resolve it. Applicant attached a copy of a letter \nfrom his state with a copy of his payment plan. The agreement recites that Applicant owed \nback taxes for tax years 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017 in the amount of $5,941, plus interest \nand penalties, for a total amount of $7,644. He presently owes less than $5,000.  \n \n \nIn 2015, he and his wife had entered into a payment plan with their state and had \nreduced their tax debt with payments for a couple of years. His wife, however, stopped \nmaking the payments because of their large medical expenses. She did this without \nadvising Applicant. At that time, she was solely responsible for managing the family\u2019s \nfinances. Under the current payment plan, they have paid three monthly installments and \ntheir back taxes will be paid off in 2020. The underlying reason for the delinquency is the \nmulti-state taxation of Applicant\u2019s income and his use of the refunds from one state to pay \nthe taxes owed in a second state. Applicant\u2019s wife diverted the refunds and used them for \n\n4 \n \nother purposes. She then failed to pay all of their taxes in the second state where they \nreside. (AE G at 1-2; AE B at 7; Tr. 11, 40-43, 45-48; 87-91, 94.) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k, Unpaid Medical Collection Accounts Totaling \nabout $3,750 - Applicant was unaware of these accounts before his April 2018 \nbackground interview. Since then, he has resolved most of these debts. He provided \nevidence from the creditor identified in SOR \u00b6 1.d, dated September 11, 2019, that this \ndebt was paid. He also provided evidence of payment from the creditors identified in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.h, and 1.k. (GE 1 at 34-38; GE 2 at 5-6; AE A at 1, 3, 6; Tr. at 54-55, 57-58.)  \n \n \nApplicant provided no evidence that he had resolved the debts owed to a creditor \nthat are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($197) and 1.g ($97), even though he was able to provide \nevidence of his resolution of another debt owed to the same creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.h), as \nnoted above. He provided evidence of his payment of a fourth debt ($218) owed to this \ncreditor, which was not alleged in the SOR. Neither the account number nor the amount \nof that debt matches the account number and debt amount alleged in either SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f \nor 1.g. Applicant claims that the unalleged debt for $218 was the only outstanding debt \nhe had with that creditor and that he paid it. In addition, he was unable to resolve the debt \nof $49 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. Applicant\u2019s June 2017 credit report, which was the basis of \nthat SOR allegation, provides insufficient information to identify and pay this creditor. \nNone of these three debts appears in GE 7, the Government\u2019s May 2019 credit report, or \nin Applicant\u2019s more recent credit reports. (GE 7 at 6; AE A at 4, GE 8; AE F; Tr. at 11, 56-\n57.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, July 2016 Judgment in the Amount of $648 \u2013 Applicant was also unaware \nof this debt when he was interviewed by a Government investigator. He testified that he \nhad resolved this judgment, and that his wife could provide details. His wife testified, but \noffered no information about this particular debt. Applicant and his wife failed to follow up \non their intention to provide evidence about the payment of this judgment. The debt no \nlonger appears on either the May 2019 credit report or on Applicant\u2019s two credit reports. \nIf the judgment was still unresolved, it would have been listed on at least one of these \ncredit reports, which supports Applicant\u2019s testimony that this judgment has been satisfied. \n(GE 2 at 6; GE 4; GE 7 at 4; GE 8; AE F; Tr. at 55-56.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j, Collection Account for a Defaulted Bank Loan in the Amount of $1,133 \u2013 \nApplicant was unaware of this collection account at the time of his background interview. \nIn about June 2017, his wife defaulted on this bank loan. He resolved this account with a \npayment in June 2019 in the amount of $577.86, as evidenced by a letter in the record \nfrom the bank\u2019s collection agency. (GE 2 at 6; GE 7 at 6; AE A at 2.) \n \n \nTo avoid a repetition of unpaid bills in the future, Applicant is now reviewing his \nfamily\u2019s bills with his wife. In addition, his wife has learned an important lesson about \nbeing completely candid with him. Her expressions of remorse over this situation \nemphasized her commitment to avoid this problem in the future. They have not sought \nfinancial counseling, though he said they planned to do so. He has provided no evidence \nof that. (Tr. at 58-61, 106.) \n\n5 \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.c, Marijuana Use from 1999 through at least 2015 \u2013 Applicant \nfirst experimented with marijuana when he was in college at age 16 or 17. He smoked \nmarijuana sporadically in his 20s and 30s on social occasions. That changed when he \nwas diagnosed with a serious illness in 2006. He was 38 at that time. Every three years \nor so, he experiences exacerbations that last for one to three weeks. He started using \nmarijuana to reduce the spasms and pain that he experienced during these periods. His \nphysician also advised him that smoking marijuana would reduce the side effects of the \ndrug he took for his illness during these intense periods of his disease. The state in which \nhe resides has enacted a \u201cmedical marijuana\u201d law, but Applicant has never obtained a \nprescription or the equivalent to buy marijuana under that law. (GE 1 at 31; GE 2 at 4; GE \n9; Tr. 12-13, 17, 53, 65-84.) \n \n \nIn his January 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed his past marijuana use during \nperiods when he held a security clearance. In response to a question about his future use \nof an illegal drug, he wrote: \u201cIn all honesty, if I get another exacerbation, there is a good \nchance that I will use marijuana again to help alleviate the effects.\u201d In mid-2017, Applicant \nlast used marijuana to ease his suffering from his illness. At that point, he made a \ncommitment to himself that he would no longer continue to use marijuana for any reason. \nIn his April 2018 background interview, he stated that he has ceased all use of marijuana \nand does not intend to use the drug in the future. At the hearing, he identified a mistake \nin the interview summary in a sentence that was inconsistent with his prior statement \nabout his future intentions regarding the use of marijuana. He also submitted a letter of \nintent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse. In his letter, he \nacknowledged that any future drug involvement or substance misuse would be grounds \nfor revocation of his national security eligibility, if granted. (GE 1 at 31; GE 2 at 4; GE 9; \nAttachment to SOR Answer; Tr. at 12-13, 17-18, 53, 79-84.) \n \n \nAfter receiving the SOR, Applicant enrolled in an intensive outpatient drug \ntreatment program. The program last two months, from July 8, 2019, to September 12, \n2019. He submitted as evidence a letter from the program that provides a favorable \nprognosis \u201cfor long-term sobriety.\u201d The letter also states that Applicant has committed to \nabstain from all substances, including alcohol. Applicant has, in fact, abstained from both \nmarijuana and alcohol since entering this program and is committed to living a substance-\nfree life. (AE C; Tr. at 79-84.) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d through 2.f, Marijuana Charges in 2002 and Twice in 2007 \u2013 In his SOR \nanswer, Applicant admitted that he was charged with marijuana-related crimes on three \noccasions, once in 2002, and again in October and December 2007. He pleaded guilty to \nthe first offense and was sentenced to serve one year on probation. He possessed \nmarijuana in 2007 because he was using marijuana to mitigate a period of particularly \nbad flare-ups of his illness following his 2006 diagnosis. He pleaded guilty to the first \noffense in 2007 and was fined. The charges in the second offense were dropped. (GE 1 \nat 28-29.) \n \n\n6 \n \n \nApplicant submitted six character reference letters as well as two letters from his \nwife. These letters provide strong support for Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, honesty and \nintegrity. He is a trusted and valued member of a team supporting a DOD component. In \nher letters, his wife accepted full responsibility for the financial issues raised in the SOR. \nShe referenced the extraordinary expenses they have incurred for Applicant\u2019s medical \ntreatment and the treatment of her serious condition, which interfered with her ability for \na period to continue paying the monthly installments on their initial state tax payment \nagreement. She also wrote that she and Applicant are current with all of their bills and \nlive modestly in a rental home. (AE A; AE G.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\n7 \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \nThe following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline apply: AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to pay . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns . . . as required.\u201d)  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n8 \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): he individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to . . . pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and are \nfrequent, but the circumstances under which they arose are unusual. Applicant\u2019s financial \nbehavior was due to his long-time pattern of entrusting his wife to handle the family \nfinances. When the uninsured portions of their large medical bills caused his wife to fall \nbehind on paying their state taxes and subsequently to cease making their monthly \npayments under a payment plan with the state authorities, she hid their problems from \nApplicant. He did not learn about this delinquency, and the fact that he had some unpaid \nmedical bills, until he began the process of renewing his security clearance. Once he \nlearned about the debts, he immediately took action and began paying them off, so that \nthe only significant remaining debt is about $5,000 of state taxes that will be paid in a few \nmonths under a new payment plan. He is now fully engaged in the family finances, and \nthe past situation is unlikely to recur. The fact that he was not previously engaged, and \nonly became involved in his family finances when his clearance was at risk, undercuts the \nfull mitigation value of his remedial actions. Under all of the circumstances, however, his \npast behavior does not cast doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s compensation is significant and reflects his \nexpertise in his field. Since 2006, however, he has experienced unusually high medical \nbills due to his chronic illness. His wife also recently incurred large medical bills due to \nher medical condition. These bills have consumed much of his income and resulted in the \nfinancial stress that gave rise to the unpaid state taxes and other bills that went unpaid. \nOnce he learned about these issues in his background interview, he took responsible \nactions to make sure they were paid and that he is current on all of his bills going forward. \nHe and his family live modestly in a rental home, saving their financial resources to pay \n\n9 \n \nfor Applicant\u2019s ongoing medical care. Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflect that he carries a \nminimal amount of consumer credit debt. The circumstances that gave rise to his financial \nproblems were beyond his control, and Applicant has acted responsibly in addressing his \ndebts and asserting control over his family finances. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Applicant testified that he intended to seek \nfinancial counseling, but he provided no evidence after the hearing that he had done so. \nNevertheless, the evidence shows that his financial problems are under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established. Applicant learned about his debts during his \nbackground interview. Since then, he has made a good-faith effort to pay his creditors. \nHis one remaining delinquent debt, his state taxes, will be fully paid later this year. The \nfact that he was motivated to pay these debts because his security clearance was at risk \nundercuts to a degree his evidence of \u201cgood-faith\u201d under this mitigating condition.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established with respect to Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax payments. He \nhas filed his tax returns in a timely manner and has entered into an installment plan to \nrepay his delinquent state taxes of about $5,000 with monthly payments of $500. He is in \ncompliance with that plan. \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under Guideline H are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; and  \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \n \n\n10 \n \n \nThe record evidence established the disqualifying conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), 25(f), and 25(g).  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s drug use is now in the past. Since \n2006, he has only used marijuana when he had exacerbations from his illness, which \noccur every two or three years. Accordingly, his past use of marijuana was infrequent. \nFurthermore, his use of marijuana is unlikely to recur. Under the circumstances, his past \ndrug involvement does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment, although, as discussed below, his use of marijuana while holding a security \nclearance raises concerns about his judgment and reliability.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is established. At one time, Applicant expressed an intent to continue \nusing marijuana infrequently to mitigate the severity of exacerbations of his illness. \nApplicant has subsequently acknowledged his misuse of an illegal drug. In mid-2017, he \nmade a commitment to himself to live a drug-free and alcohol-free life. He has succeeded \nin fulfilling that commitment to improve his life. He has also signed a statement of intent \npursuant to the terms of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3).  \n \n\n11 \n \nAG \u00b6 26(d) is partially established. Although he was not prescribed to participate \nin a drug treatment program, he voluntarily entered an intensive outpatient program. His \nvoluntary actions demonstrate his sincere intention to terminate his reliance on marijuana \nto ease his suffering from his illness. He completed the two-month program and received \na favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance, which at one time \nresulted in criminal charges on three occasions, raises the most serious security concerns \nset forth in the SOR and the most difficult to mitigate. This history calls into question \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. His actions were the result of his reliance on self-help \nto treat a painful, chronic illness and to minimize the side effects of his prescribed \nmedications for his illness. After a careful consideration of all of the evidence, including \nmy assessment of Applicant\u2019s credibility, his two and one-half years of sobriety, and his \nsincere desire to make a significant change in his life regarding his past use of marijuana \nand alcohol, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised under \nAG \u00b6 25(f). \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and H in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed above, but other factors warrant additional comment. I have taken \ninto consideration Applicant\u2019s age. A person of his age should be mature enough to know \nbetter than to use an illegal drug while holding a security clearance. I have also taken into \nconsideration Applicant\u2019s serious disease and the role that it played in his use of \nmarijuana. Applicant\u2019s use was infrequent and since 2006 has been limited to the unusual \ncircumstances of his illness and his desire for relief from pain and the side effects of the \nmedication that he takes when he experiences an exacerbation. Over two years ago, he \nmade a commitment to himself to abstain from drugs and alcohol. He has shown his \ncommitment to a drug-free life by voluntarily entering an intensive outpatient treatment \nprogram. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony to be credible and sincere. There is little likelihood \nthat this situation will recur in the future. With respect to his finances, he is resolving his \n\n12 \n \ndelinquent state taxes, and has made a good-faith effort to pay his medical and other \ndebts. Now that he has assumed a role in the family finances, it is unlikely that he will \nexperience future delinquencies with his taxes or other bills. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nH and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial considerations and \ndrug involvement while holding a security clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations:   \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through1.k: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement: \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interests of the United States \nto grant Applicant national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's admissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 58 years old. He graduated from college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1985. In 1989, he married, but he was separated from his spouse in 2010, and in 2012, their divorce was finalized. They have four adult children. (Tr. 16, 19, 55; GE 1) In 1992, Applicant started his own computer software consulting company. He was very successful for many years with his business. In mid-2000, Applicant was not receiving much income or profit from his business. In 2002, a doctor solicited Applicant to start up a medical software business. Applicant and the doctor became owners of the limited liability company, and the doctor provided his income and revenue while Applicant developed the software. Over time, Applicant invested more of his money and time into the medical software, to the detriment of his other consulting software business. He acknowledged at the hearing that developing new software was a risk, but he believed the medical software had great potential in the medical community. His income continued to steadily decrease over time. In 2010, his wife left him, and his income was reduced even more. In 2012, he borrowed money from his retirement fund, which caused additional adverse tax consequences for him. Applicant was unemployed with no income from approximately 2014 through the fall of 2016, and due to these circumstances, h",

National security eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 5, 2017, Applicant completed and signed his security clearance \napplication (SCA). On July 9, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017.    \n \nApplicant submitted a response to the SOR with documentation on August 2, 2019. \nHe admitted all of the SOR allegations, and he requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. On December 4, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On January \n\n \n2 \n \n8, 2020, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, \nsetting the hearing for January 13, 2020. Applicant did not receive the required full 15-\nday notice of his hearing, but he waived the 15-day hearing notice requirement via e-mail \ncommunication with Department Counsel. During the hearing, he also confirmed his \nwaiver on the record, acknowledging that he did not require the full 15 days of notice of \nhis hearing since he was ready to proceed. (Tr. 9-10) I found Applicant knowingly waived \nhis 15-day hearing notice requirement, and the January 13, 2020 hearing proceeded as \nscheduled. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6.  \nApplicant testified, and offered 12 documents, to include some documents previously \nsubmitted with the SOR Response, which I labeled Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through L. I \nadmitted all proffered exhibits into evidence without objection. I held the record open for \nten days after the hearing, in the event either party wanted to submit additional \ndocumentation. Applicant timely submitted three additional documents, AE M, N, and O, \nwhich I admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on January 22, 2020, and the record was closed on January 23, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 58 years old. He graduated \nfrom college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1985. In 1989, he married, but he was separated \nfrom his spouse in 2010, and in 2012, their divorce was finalized. They have four adult \nchildren. (Tr. 16, 19, 55; GE 1) \n \n \nIn 1992, Applicant started his own computer software consulting company. He was \nvery successful for many years with his business. In mid-2000, Applicant was not \nreceiving much income or profit from his business. In 2002, a doctor solicited Applicant \nto start up a medical software business. Applicant and the doctor became owners of the \nlimited liability company, and the doctor provided his income and revenue while Applicant \ndeveloped the software. Over time, Applicant invested more of his money and time into \nthe medical software, to the detriment of his other consulting software business. He \nacknowledged at the hearing that developing new software was a risk, but he believed \nthe medical software had great potential in the medical community. His income continued \nto steadily decrease over time. In 2010, his wife left him, and his income was reduced \neven more. In 2012, he borrowed money from his retirement fund, which caused \nadditional adverse tax consequences for him. Applicant was unemployed with no income \nfrom approximately 2014 through the fall of 2016, and due to these circumstances, he \nexperienced severe financial and tax complications. (Tr. 17-19, 58-59, 96) \n \n \nPrior to development of the medical software in 2002, Applicant had an impeccable \ncredit history and had timely filed all of his annual tax returns. In 2014, the doctor found \nanother business partner, and Applicant was no longer receiving any income. Applicant \ndid not have money for food, and with the failed business and his difficult divorce, he \nstarted to use alcohol to excess. In June 2014, Applicant was hospitalized after he \nstopped eating food and was only drinking alcohol. In October 2014, he realized that he \n\n \n3 \n \nneeded to turn his life around. He met with an attorney and filed his 2010-2014 tax returns \nin late 2014. He dissolved the medical software company in 2015, battled in court to \nmaintain his rights to the medical software, and he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nSeptember 2015. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) His allowable bankruptcy liabilities were discharged in \nJanuary 2016.  (Tr. 19, 59- 64, 71, 88-89; GE 1, GE 2)  \n \n  \nIn April 2017, Applicant obtained employment with a DOD contractor as a software \nengineer. His employer is sponsoring him for a security clearance that is necessary for \nhim to perform specific job duties. Since his employment, Applicant has received \noutstanding employee evaluations and regular increases in pay. His current annual salary \nis $132,016. (Tr. 23, 57; GE 1; AE A, AE B, AE G, AE H, AE M) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e allege that Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government in the \napproximate amount of $90,475, for the unpaid taxes for tax years 2011-2014. Applicant \noverpaid his Federal taxes for tax years 2016, 2017 and 2018. His combined Federal tax \nrefunds in the approximate amount of $16,243 were applied to his delinquent Federal tax \ndebt. Applicant made an offer in compromise to the Internal Revenue Service, (IRS) in \nApril 2019. Beginning in May 2019, he started making monthly payments of $696 in \naccordance with his Offer in Compromise. After making seven consecutive monthly \npayments totaling $4,872, he received notification from the IRS that his Offer in \nCompromise was not accepted. The IRS believed he was capable of paying his \ndelinquent Federal taxes in full. Applicant received communication from an IRS \nrepresentative informing him that if an installment agreement was established with the \nIRS, his monthly payments would be $1,533. In December 2019, Applicant began making \nthese monthly payments. As of January 2020, Applicant estimated he had repaid about \n$28,181 of his delinquent Federal tax debt. He intends to continue paying his Federal tax \ndebt until it is fully resolved. (Tr. 23-25, 89-94; AE C, AE D, AE F, AE L, AE O) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant is indebted to State A for delinquent taxes in the \napproximate amount of $9,244. He admitted that state tax liens were filed against him, \nbut he was not certain of the tax years upon which the liens were based. In December \n2018, State A tax department asked him to start a payment plan. His 2016 and 2017 state \ntaxes were overpaid, and the refunds from those tax years were applied to offset the \nunpaid tax balance. Beginning in January 2019, Applicant agreed to pay $1,000 every \nmonth, and he paid faithfully until November 2019, when all State A tax liens were fully \nsatisfied. (Tr. 22, 71-82; GE 5; AE J, AE K, AE N) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n4 \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n5 \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n  \n AG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d The evidence of record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further \ninquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \nThe SOR alleges: a 2015 Chapter 7 bankruptcy that was discharged in early 2016; \ndelinquent Federal taxes totaling approximately $90,000; and delinquent taxes with State \nA which resulted in about $10,000 of state tax liens filed against him. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.    \n  \n \nBeginning in mid-2000, Applicant suffered financial hardship due to a failed \nbusiness and unsuccessful marriage. He was unable to pay his Federal and state taxes \nafter his income was adversely affected by these unforeseen events. In October 2014, \nafter hitting rock bottom, Applicant realized he needed to make positive changes in his \nlife. He exercised reasonable diligence in addressing his business problems, financial, \nand tax issues. He took legal action to retain the rights to the medical software he \ndeveloped, and he dissolved the failed business. He also wisely retained the services of \n\n \n6 \n \nan attorney to file all of his late income tax returns and initiate Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He \nhas satisfied all of his state tax liens and he continues to make monthly payments to the \nIRS. \n \n \nApplicant established that his financial and tax problems arose from events and \ncircumstances beyond his control. He has fully resolved his state tax issues, and he has \nrepaid approximately a third of his delinquent Federal taxes. Applicant took responsible \naction to file and pay his Federal and state taxes before the SOR was issued in July 2019. \nHe is committed to paying the monthly amount instructed by the IRS until his Federal tax \ndebt is paid in full. Under the current circumstances, there are clear indications that his \ntax problem is being resolved, and his finances are under control. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis.  \n \n \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nBeginning in October 2014, Applicant made positive changes in his life and took \nresponsible action in dealing with his failed business and tax problems. His strong work \nethic is also evident with the submission of his outstanding employee evaluations and pay \nincreases by his employer. He is committed to resolving his Federal tax obligation, and I \nfind any future financial or tax problems are unlikely to recur. After evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_______________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The amended SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in about January 2019, which was still pending as of May 14, 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and that Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016, and owed at least $9,288 in delinquent federal taxes as of May 14, 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Under Guideline D, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in September 2016 for lewdness, open and gross; accost or annoy another person; and indecent exposure (SOR \u00b6 2.a). When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted the Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing, but explained that his divorce caused financial strain and negatively impacted his children\u2019s emotional and physical health. He also acknowledged that he had not filed his federal income tax returns on time for tax years 2015 and 2016 due to his divorce, but they were filed in January 2019. His tax indebtedness was being repaid through his Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan, and he had made several months of payments under the plan. In response to the Guideline D allegation, Applicant explained that his accuser was an underage female friend of one of his daughters and that the allegations of sexual misconduct were proven to be completely false, as evidenced by the dismissal of 3 the charges.

His divorce \nstrained his finances, and he has made ten months of payments under his bankruptcy \nplan, but some concerns persist about his financial judgment. Charges of indecent \nexposure and lewdness in September 2016 were not fully established. Clearance eligibility \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn May 14, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \n\n2 \n \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn July 9, 2019, Applicant responded to the Guideline F allegations and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On August 30, 2019, Department Counsel amended the SOR to add a Guideline \nD sexual behavior security concern (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant responded to the new allegation \non September 20, 2019. \n \nOn January 24, 2020, Department Counsel indicated that the Government was \nready to proceed to a hearing, and the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On February 3, 2020, I scheduled a hearing for March 3, \n2020. On February 24, 2020, DOHA became aware that Applicant had been separated \nfrom his defense-contractor employment on January 27, 2020. Applicant informed \nDepartment Counsel that he had a job offer with another defense contractor, so jurisdiction \nwas established to convene the hearing as scheduled. \n \nAt the hearing, 10 Government exhibits (GEs 1-10) and 12 Applicant exhibits (AEs \nA-L) were accepted into the record without objection. Extensive documentation submitted \nwith Applicant\u2019s response to the Guideline F allegations was admitted as AE A. Character \nreference letters submitted with his response to the Guideline D allegation were admitted \ncollectively as AE B. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March \n11, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe amended SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed for a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy in about January 2019, which was still pending as of May 14, 2019 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a); and that Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2015 \nand 2016, and owed at least $9,288 in delinquent federal taxes as of May 14, 2019 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b). Under Guideline D, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in September 2016 for \nlewdness, open and gross; accost or annoy another person; and indecent exposure (SOR \n\u00b6 2.a). \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted the Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy filing, but explained that his divorce caused financial strain and negatively \nimpacted his children\u2019s emotional and physical health. He also acknowledged that he had \nnot filed his federal income tax returns on time for tax years 2015 and 2016 due to his \ndivorce, but they were filed in January 2019. His tax indebtedness was being repaid \nthrough his Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan, and he had made several months of payments \nunder the plan. In response to the Guideline D allegation, Applicant explained that his \naccuser was an underage female friend of one of his daughters and that the allegations of \nsexual misconduct were proven to be completely false, as evidenced by the dismissal of \n\n3 \n \nthe charges. (Answer.) After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcripts, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is 58 years old. He has been married and divorced three times. He and his \nthird wife married in October 1995 and divorced in September 2013 because of domestic \nviolence between his ex-wife and the oldest of their three daughters. He indicated in \nresponse to the SOR that his ex-wife was arrested in December 2009 and removed from \nthe marital home because of domestic violence, and that over the next two years, he spent \nthousands of dollars as a court-appointed guardian ad litem investigated and gave him \nphysical custody of their daughters. Additionally, he incurred the costs of therapy for their \ndaughters, although he did not elaborate as to the extent of those costs. Their daughters \nare now ages 19, 17, and 15, and they live with him. He has a 36-year-old son from his first \nmarriage and a 33-year-old daughter from his second marriage. He has had no contact \nwith them in years. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 39-40.) \n \nApplicant served honorably on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from August 1979 to \nAugust 1983. He then served in the U.S. Amy from March 1984 until June 1984, when he \nwas separated under other than honorable conditions. (GE 1.) He explained that he was \nseparated after he reported his training officer for hitting other people, but he would not \nelaborate any further because his records are \u201csealed.\u201d (GE 2.) Applicant then enlisted in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps and served honorably from May 1985 to May 1989. He \nsubsequently served honorably in the Air National Guard (ANG) from May 1996 until he \nretired as a senior master sergeant in February 2011. He was called to active duty for the \nAir Force and deployed from February 2002 to November 2002. (GE 1; AEs G-J, L.) \nApplicant was granted a DOD secret clearance in June 1997. He was first granted sensitive \ncompartmented information (SCI) access eligibility in April 2008 for his ANG duties. (GE 1.) \n \nApplicant attended a community college from September 2007 to June 2008 while \nworking full-time for the ANG as an information technology network manager. From \nSeptember 2008 to June 2015, Applicant was employed as a systems engineer by a \ndefense contractor (company X). (GE 1; AE K.) He took online classes part time from \nSeptember 2010 to March 2015, and earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2013 and his \nmaster\u2019s degree in March 2015. (GEs 1-2.) \n \nIn July 2015, Applicant began working as a project lead for a defense contractor at \nan Air Force base located a considerable distance from his home. In June 2016, he \nbecame employed by the defense contractor that took over the contact. In December 2016, \nhe left that job for an information assurance position with company X at a worksite nearer \nto his home. (GE 1; AE K.) While in that position, he completed and certified to the \naccuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on May 17, 2017. He \nlisted a September 2016 criminal charge of indecent exposure, which was then in pretrial \nproceedings. In response to the SF 86 inquiries into his financial record, he responded \nnegatively to a question concerning whether in the last seven years he had failed to file or \npay federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance. He also answered \n\u201cNo\u201d to inquiries into any delinquency involving routine accounts, but conversely responded \n\u201cYes\u201d to a question regarding whether he was currently seeking assistance for financial \n\n4 \n \ndifficulties, and stated:  \u201cconsolidation of debt due in part of divorce, a high mortgage until I \nhad an opportunity to refinance. Additional house repairs were needed.\u201d Regarding efforts \nto resolve his financial difficulties, he explained: \n \nSince working with Freedom Debt Relief I have been paying down my debt \neach month with a payment of $1,149 although my credit score was \nnegatively affected, the long term plan 36 months will bring my debt under \ncontrol. (GE 1.) \n \n \nIn July 2017, Applicant left his job with company X because he and his supervisor \n\u201cdid not always see eye to eye and he wanted a different opportunity.\u201d (GE 2; AE K.) In \nAugust 2017, Applicant returned to work at the Air Force base under the employment of yet \nanother defense contractor. His resume indicates that he was granted a top secret \nclearance and SCI access eligibility in 2017 (AE K), although he testified that he has held a \ntop secret clearance and SCI access eligibility since 2013. (Tr. 41-42.)  \n \n \nOn April 12, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant acknowledged that he had not yet filed \nhis income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016; that he owed delinquent debts; and \nthat he had been arrested for indecent exposure. (GE 2.) The salient details about these \nissues follow. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant and his third wife filed for divorce against each other in January 2010. \nTheir divorce became final in September 2013. They share legal custody of their three \ndaughters, for whom his ex-wife was ordered to pay child support of $293 per week starting \nJuly 5, 2013. In their divorce settlement dated June 17, 2013, Applicant retained sole legal \ntitle of the marital home purchased in September 2008 and became solely responsible for \npaying the mortgage. His ex-wife was given half of his federal employee\u2019s defined pension \nplan for the portion of his benefits earned between October 1995 and March 2013. His \npension was to be divided by a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) prepared by a \nprofessional with the costs for the QDRO to be shared equally. Applicant was required \nwithin 90 days to pay $20,000 into his ex-wife\u2019s retirement account and $8,500 towards the \nmarital debts. Applicant\u2019s annual earnings totaled $121,825 in 2013 and $124,766 in 2014. \n(AE A.) \n \n \nIn June 2015, Applicant refinanced the mortgage on his home, obtaining a 30-year \nDepartment of Veteran\u2019s Affairs loan for $397,270 and lowering his monthly mortgage \npayment obligation from $2,998 to $2,500. (GEs 5, 7; Tr. 46.) He paid off that loan through \na refinancing in January 2018 that lowered his monthly mortgage payment by another \n$300. (GEs 5, 7.) Between 2015 and 2018, Applicant obtained several loans and credit \ncards on which he defaulted in his payments (GE 7), despite more than $100,000 in annual \nincome each year ($118,661 in 2015, $108,039 in 2016, $115,198 in 2017, and $107,352 \nin 2018) and the premature withdrawal of retirement assets in 2016. (AE A.) Some of the \nloans were obtained to pay for his divorce attorney. He testified that, by the time his divorce \n\n5 \n \nwas finalized in 2013, his attorney cost him $59,000. (Tr. 55-56.) He provided no \ndocumentation to corroborate that amount. \n \n \nDuring his April 2018 OPM interview, Applicant did not dispute most of the adverse \ncredit information that was on his credit record but not reported by him on his SF 86. He \nasserted that a March 2018 credit-card judgment for $1,294 had been settled for $850 (but \nthen included it as a $1,294 debt in a January 2019 bankruptcy filing). He admitted that he \nhad not paid a loan charged off for $6,566 in May 2017; two loans totaling $15,242 \ncharged off in October 2017; five consumer-credit debts totaling approximately $12,686 \ncharged off in November 2017; and four credit-card accounts for $16,978 in collection \nsince 2017. He admitted that he had received collection notices for several of his past-due \ndebts. \n \n \nApplicant also acknowledged that five federal student loans totaling some $63,518 \nhad been placed for collection in November 2017 because of nonpayment. He had thought \nthey were in deferment until June 2018. He explained that he was under a repayment plan \nfor his federal student loans starting March 2018 and was making $325 monthly payments. \nHe claimed to not recognize two other debts: a charge-off for $1,344 from November 2017 \nand a collection debt of $1,186 from April 2017 (both debts are on his Chapter 13 petition). \n \n \nApplicant also admitted to the investigator that he had not filed his federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016 because he was concerned he would owe taxes \nand could not pay them. He wanted to catch up financially before filing them and indicated \nduring his OPM interview that he was in the process of filing his delinquent tax returns. (GE \n2.) \n \n \nAvailable credit information from August 2019 indicates that Applicant stopped \npaying on most of his consumer credit cards and personal loans in the summer of 2016. \nHe last paid on his federal student loans in July 2018. (GE 7.) Applicant explained to the \nOPM investigator in April 2018 that he could not keep up with his finances after his divorce \nfrom his third wife, given the loss of her annual income of approximately $80,000 annually, \nand also having to pay a criminal lawyer about $10,000 to represent him for a September \n2016 indecent exposure charge. He explained that he had used Freedom Debt Relief, a \ncredit-counseling service, from the fall of 2016 until June 2017 (Tr. 45), which helped him \nconsolidate and pay off some debts. (GE 2.) He paid Freedom Debt Relief about $1,000 a \nmonth. (Tr. 44.) He expressed his intent to use a credit counseling service in the future to \nhelp with his debts. He indicated that he was not able to meet all his financial obligations \non time. (GE 2.) Available evidence shows that $8,070 in delinquent debt was cancelled in \n2017. (GE 5; AE A.) \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant explained that he did not continue with Freedom Debt \nRelief because \u201c[he] had probably every appliance in [his] house break down from [his] \nfurnace to [his] tractor lawn mower to [his] washer and dryer to [his] refrigerator.\u201d He gave \npriority to keeping his house functioning rather than paying on his delinquent debts \nbecause he did not want his children to be taken away from him. (Tr. 42-43.) He also \nrecalls that all three of his daughters may have been in orthodontic treatment at that time. \n\n6 \n \n(Tr. 44.) He explained at his hearing that the divorce had \u201cresidual effect;\u201d that there were \n\u201cso may things that weighted [sic] on [his] shoulders;\u201d but he admitted he made \u201cpoor \nchoices,\u201d such as $1,645 in retail credit charges at Victoria\u2019s Secret. (Tr. 81.) When asked \nabout a credit card with an accumulated balance of $14,003 on his bankruptcy petition, \nApplicant explained that it was for \u201cappliances and stuff,\u201d and for replacing carpeting with \nhardwood flooring because of his children\u2019s allergies. (Tr. 83-84.) \n \n \n \nIn August 2018, Applicant sought legal counsel for advice about dealing with his \ndebt. Four months later, he retained the services of the attorney at a fee of $4,000 to assist \nhim with a bankruptcy filing. After receiving a required briefing from an approved credit \ncounseling agency, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on January 31, 2019. \nHe listed an unsecured priority claim of $10,800 consisting of delinquent federal income \ntaxes ($3,800 for tax year 2015 and $7,000 for tax year 2016), and nonpriority claims of \n$144,856, consisting of $66,232 in federal student loan debts and unsecured credit card \nand loan debts totaling $78,624 (including some debts not discussed during his April 2018 \ninterview). Two of his unsecured creditors, who were owed $1,294 and $6,741, were \nseeking judgments against him. Applicant listed as secured claims the $394,967 owed on \nhis mortgage and $20,775 owed on a car loan for a 2012 sport-utility vehicle. Applicant \nlisted monthly income of $7,935, which included $1,248 in child support and $6,327 in \ntake-home pay from his job as program manager with a defense contractor. His monthly \nexpenses included $2,130 for his mortgage, $550 for his car payment, and $335 for a \nvehicle leased for his now 19-year-old daughter. With estimated monthly expenses totaling \n$7,235, he reportedly had $700 in discretionary income with which to pay his creditors. \n(GEs 3-5; AE A.) \n \n \nOn March 15, 2019, Applicant moved to amend his bankruptcy, in part to add under \nSchedule D a claim for his daughter\u2019s piano. The debt was brought to his attention when \nthe creditor asserted a claim in his bankruptcy. Under a new summary of his assets and \nliabilities, he reported that he owed $19,964 in priority unsecured claims for taxes; \n$144,856 in nonpriority unsecured claims of which $66,232 was his federal student loans; \nand secured claims of $428,310 (his car loan, mortgage, and $12,568 for his daughter\u2019s \npiano). He reported net income after expenses of $573 per month. He filed a Chapter 13 \nplan under which he proposed to pay $573 per month for 60 months. His mortgage, car \npayment, and payment on a used piano for his daughter were to be paid directly to his \ncreditors rather than through the plan. His federal income tax delinquency of $9,288 for tax \nyears 2015 and 2016, state income tax debt of $760, $2,500 of his bankruptcy attorney\u2019s \nfees, and $340 in pre-petition arrearage on his car loan were to be paid in full under the \nplan. His unsecured claims totaling $78,624, including the federal student loans, were to be \npaid at a pro rata share of 12.42%. However, his federal student loans will survive the \nbankruptcy discharge. (AE A.) \n \n \nOn March 20, 2019, Applicant completed a post-petition personal financial \nmanagement course for his bankruptcy filing, and he made a payment of $700 to the \nbankruptcy trustee. Applicant filed amended Chapter 13 plans on May 14, 2019, and again \non June 5, 2019, which are not in the record. An order confirming his Chapter 13 plan was \nentered on July 26, 2019. (GE 3.) As of August 5, 2019, 25 creditor claims had been filed \n\n7 \n \ntotaling $587,195, which included $429,470 in secured claims and $9,050 in priority claims \n(federal and state taxes). Of his $157,674 in unsecured claims, $68,206 is his student loan \ndebt. (AE A.) Bankruptcy payment records show he has made monthly payments of $575 \nto the trustee from April 2019 through January 2020. He testified he made his payment for \nFebruary 2020 as well. (AE E; Tr. 47.) Applicant testified that he has not been late in any \ndebt payments since he filed his bankruptcy petition in late January 2019. (Tr. 84-85.) \nAvailable credit information from August 2019 indicates that he had been chronically late in \nmaking his car payment from September 2017 through January 2019. His mortgage \npayments have been made on time, although his mother and sister helped him by \ncontributing about $700 so that he could make his $2,200 mortgage payment for February \n2020 when he was unemployed. (GE 7; Tr. 45, 48-50.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2015 were completed \nby a tax preparer on April 12, 2017, but not submitted by Applicant until late February 2019 \nor early March 2019, after his non-filing came to the attention of the bankruptcy court. His \nfederal return for 2015 was received by the IRS on March 5, 2019. For tax year 2015, his \nadjusted gross income was $136,186. He reported underpayments of $1,121 in federal \nincome taxes and $472 in state income taxes for tax year 2015. As of June 17, 2019, he \nowed the IRS $1,777 for tax year 2015. His federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyear 2016 were completed by a tax preparer in January 2019. His federal income tax return \nfor 2016 was received by the IRS on February 21, 2019. His adjusted gross income for \n2016 was $151,176, which included $106,651 in salary but also $44,000 in taxable income \ndue to an early disbursement of retirement funds that he indicates went to house repairs \nand a minivan. (Tr. 84.) He underpaid his federal income taxes by $6,662 for 2016. As of \nJune 2, 2019, he owed the IRS $9,748 for tax year 2016 due to penalties and interest. (AE \nA.) At his hearing, he explained his belated tax filings as follows: \n \nAnd that really was the height of everything just coming together financially, \nyou know, between car and appliances. And trying to fix the house up and \ntrying to make a decision on my own as to whether or not the best thing to do \nwas to keep the house and try to keep the children. And it was just a lot for \none person to be able to handle at that time. And you know, I think that, that \njust was something that slipped. It wasn\u2019t a priority at that time. And I realized \nit. Anyways, I\u2019ve tried to make amends for that. (Tr. 59.) \n \n \nApplicant testified, without any corroborating documentation, that he had filed his \nincome tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018. (Tr. 62.) \n \n \nIn June 2019, Applicant became employed by another defense contractor when his \nprevious employer lost the contract with the Air Force. On January 27, 2020, Applicant was \nlaid off for lack of work. (AE K, Tr. 36-37.) He collected unemployment compensation of \n$700 a week in February 2020. (Tr. 63-64.) On March 2, 2020, he started a new job with a \ndefense contractor as an information technology manager for a limited access area at an \nannual salary of $130,000. (Tr. 38-39, 54.) He is required to maintain a DOD security \nclearance and is working in an unclassified environment pending the adjudication of his \n\n8 \n \nclearance eligibility. (Tr. 38-39.) The job is closer to his home pays more than his previous \njob. (AE C.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 19-year-old daughter was in college as of March 2020. She is no longer \nhis dependent for income tax purposes, although Applicant was helping her with college \nexpenses through his GI bill. (Tr. 41.) His ex-wife continues to pay child support for their \nother two daughters, currently at a reduced $196 a week because of her financial situation. \n(Tr. 43-44.) As of his March 3, 2020 hearing, Applicant had approximately $1,400 in his \nchecking account and $2,300 in his savings account. (Tr. 49.) He has three open credit-\ncard accounts on which he owes an aggregate balance of approximately $1,000. (Tr. 65-\n66.) \n \nSexual Behavior \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on September 10, 2016, on three counts: misdemeanor \nindecent assault and battery on a person age 14 or over; felony enticement of a child; and \nfelony lewdness, open and gross. A female teen friend of one of Applicant\u2019s daughters \nreported to the police that she had gone to Applicant\u2019s residence to help clean. Applicant \nwas home alone and directed her to his bedroom to fold some laundry. He told her that he \nwas going to shower in an adjoining bathroom. He came to the bedroom fully clothed a \nshort time later and asked her if she was interested in having sex with him, and despite her \nnegative response, he continued to compliment her before exposing himself and \nmasturbating in front of her. After he told her that the incident would stay between them, \nshe ran home. Although reportedly hysterical, she gave a similar account of the incident to \nher sister, and their mother took them to the police station, where they filed a complaint. \nThe girl\u2019s mother told the police that her daughter had no psychological issues and was not \non any psychiatric medication. When the police questioned Applicant at his home, \nApplicant stated nothing had happened at his home, and he denied that he had exposed \nhimself. He told the police that he and the girl were upstairs when she made a comment \nabout something \u201ckinky,\u201d looked at her phone, and then left. Applicant posted $3,500 bail \nand was released. (GE 9.) \n \n \nCourt records indicate that Applicant was charged on September 12, 2016, with \nfelony lewdness, open and gross; misdemeanor accost/annoy another person; and \nmisdemeanor indecent exposure. Applicant reported his arrest to security officials at work \nin February 2017, when he applied for a special access program. When asked by the \nfacility security officer why he had not self-reported in a timely fashion, Applicant \nresponded that he was unaware he had to report being arrested. (GE 8.) \n \n \nWhen asked about the charges during his April 2018 OPM interview, Applicant \nstated that he had been arrested for indecent exposure and possibly a second charge of \ngross or lewd conduct. He told the OPM investigator that his daughter had a friend, then \nage 16 (Tr. 68), over to their house in September 2016; that the girl walked by his bedroom \nand reported seeing him drying off after a shower; and that since his door was barely ajar, \nshe must have opened the door. He asserted that the girl had a history of mental health \ntreatments and of making false accusations, and that the case against him was dismissed \n\n9 \n \non April 10, 2018. (GE 2.) Available court records corroborate that the charges were \ndismissed with prejudice on April 10, 2018. (GE 10.) \n \n \nApplicant asserts that records obtained through subpoena during his criminal \nproceedings reveal that the complainant had a history of psychological treatment, including \nan admission to a mental health facility for an extended period, and that she had previously \nmade similar accusations against others, and so the court recommended that the case be \ndismissed. (AE F; Tr. 68.) \n \n \nWhen asked at his security clearance hearing to give his version of the events of \nSeptember 2016, Applicant responded that, at the request of his daughter, he agreed to \npay her friend for some painting, covering the pool, and yard work around his house; that \nhis daughter was called into work and not home when the girl came over; that he met the \ngirl at the front door and told her that she could return in the afternoon if she wished. He \nthen stated: \n \nAnd that was it. I mean I kind of looked at her and she had a drink or \nsomething in her hand. And she just looked rather odd. So she mumbled \nsomething under her breath and you know, she left. (Tr. 67-69.) \n \n \nWhen confronted by his April 2018 discrepant account to the OPM investigator that \nthe girl must have seen him drying off after his shower, Applicant responded: \n \nThat could have happened before because I was trying to recall that my \ndaughter has a whole bunch of friends. And this is a girl that has come over \nto our house a couple of times before. And I know that they were in our pool \nand they were upstairs. And they were all, you know, changing and what \nhave you. And you know, I\u2019m in my master bedroom, you know, and I could \nhave \u2014 this is what I\u2019m recalling. I think that something that may have \nhappened a few days earlier where I was in my shower and she was upstairs \nin my daughter\u2019s room. And I think she may have seen me through my door \nbeing, you know, ajar. . . And I believe that, that\u2019s the story that she went \nhome and told her older sister. And you know, it was just absolutely shocking \nto me because I didn\u2019t \u2014 the police didn\u2019t come over to my house for almost \nfive or six hours later. So I was absolutely stunned as to, you know, [that] \nthey were making accusations [against] me. (Tr. 69-70.) \n \n \nApplicant persisted in denying that the teenager was upstairs with him on the day in \nquestion. (Tr. 72-73.) When confronted with the police report, where he had reportedly told \nthe police that he and the girl were upstairs when she made a comment about something \n\u201ckinky\u201d before leaving, Applicant denied he had made the comment, and asserted that  the \ngirl was in his residence less than five minutes. (Tr. 72.) As to why he did not converse with \nthe girl outside given his daughter was not home, Applicant responded, \u201cBut I\u2019ve had so \nmany girls \u2014 children in my house over the course of this many years . . . . So that was \nvery normal.\u201d (Tr. 73.) \n \n\n10 \n \n \nApplicant has strong ties to his community, where he has lived for 12 years. He is \nactive in his church, daughters\u2019 school, and their basketball team. (AE C; Tr. 88.) \n \nCharacter References \n \n \nFive individuals authored character references for Applicant. They have worked \nalongside Applicant in the military or as defense contract employees or both and \nrecommend him for a security clearance. They consider Applicant to be trustworthy and to \nhave high integrity. A captain in the Air Force expressed confidence that Applicant is very \ntrustworthy and can be trusted to maintain confidentiality and loyalty to our country. A \ncontractor employed as a project lead on an Air Force cyberspace defense weapon system \nhas known Applicant for four years. He indicates that Applicant is committed to his career, \nhis family, and the country, and that \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] dedication to raising his children with the \nsame values and respect which he demonstrates on the job is something to be admired.\u201d \n(AE B.) None of these co-workers mentioned any of the security concerns at issue, so it is \nunclear whether they know of Applicant\u2019s financial problems or his arrest. \n                                                                                                                                            \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n\n11 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nThe Guideline F security concerns are well established by his record of considerable \ncredit-card and loan delinquencies, including $68,206 in federal student-loan debt; by his \n\n12 \n \nfailure to timely comply with his income tax filing obligations for tax years 2015 and 2016; \nand by his past-due federal income taxes that have accrued to $11,525. Based on the facts \nin this case, four disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by noncompliance with his tax filings and his delinquent debts. Application \nof the aforesaid disqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20. One or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in \npart: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n\n13 \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply. Available credit information shows that \nApplicant stopped paying on several consumer-credit accounts during the summer of 2016. \nMany of his past-due debts went unaddressed until January 2019, when he filed a Chapter \n13 bankruptcy petition. As of his amended petition in March 2019, he owed $157,674 in \nnonpriority unsecured claims of which $68,206 was defaulted federal student-loan debt. \nHis financial problems are too recent and recurrent for mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability because of Applicant\u2019s protracted divorce \nproceedings and related issues, such as the cost of the guardian ad litem and therapy for \nhis daughters. His uncorroborated testimony is that he incurred some $59,000 in attorney \nfees over the three years. He provided no information about his other expenses related to \nthe divorce, such as the expense of his daughters\u2019 therapy. He kept the marital home after \nthe divorce and had to cover the mortgage payment, then almost $3,000 a month, on his \nincome alone. He testified that he had to replace nearly every appliance in his home, and \nthat he had to remove carpeting because of his children\u2019s allergies. He had some decline in \nhis income in recent years, but his ex-wife was paying and continues to pay him child \nsupport. His reliance on consumer credit persisted after his divorce with seemingly little \nconsideration to what he could reasonably afford. \n \nI have to consider whether Applicant acted in a responsible manner when dealing \nwith his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, \n2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, \n2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained contact with his creditors. While he \nmay have been confused as to whether his student loans were deferred, he knew that he \nhad stopped paying on several credit-card accounts in the summer of 2016. He admitted \nduring his April 2018 that he received collection notices in many cases. He attempted to \nwork through Freedom Debt Relief from the fall of 2016 to June 2017, but then did little to \nresolve his debts before consulting with an attorney in August 2018, who advised him to file \nfor bankruptcy. It took Applicant another four months to decide to proceed with a Chapter \n13 filing, even though he had to know as of his April 2018 interview that his unresolved \nfinancial issues were of concern to the DOD. Applicant failed to give sufficient priority to \nresolving his past-due debts. \n \nApplicant also exhibited irresponsibility in his handling of his tax issues for 2015 and \n2016. Applicant\u2019s federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2015 were prepared in \nApril 2017, but were not filed until late February 2019 or early March 2019. His tax returns \nfor tax year 2016 were completed by a professional preparer in late January 2019 and filed \nby Applicant shortly thereafter. He testified that his income tax returns for tax years 2017 \nand 2018 have been filed. Even where an applicant has corrected his tax problems, and is \nmotivated to present such problems in the future, the administrative judge is not precluded \nfrom considering an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in light of longstanding behavior evidencing \n\n14 \n \nirresponsibility. See ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).  As recently \nnoted by the DOHA Appeal Board, \u201cA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nobligations, such as filing tax returns when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of \ngood judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information.\u201d \nSee ISCR Case No. 18-01045 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2019), citing ISCR Case No. 17-\n03978 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 6, 2019). Applicant was obligated to file his income tax returns \non time, whether or not he could afford to pay the taxes owed. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c), AG \u00b6 20(d), and AG \u00b6 20(g) warrant some consideration because of his \nbankruptcy filing, which includes his federal tax delinquency, and because of his belated \nsubmissions of his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. As of \nearly March 2020, he had made ten months of $535 payments under an approved Chapter \n13 plan. Applicant had credit counseling that is required for a bankruptcy filing. If he makes \nall his payments, his unsecured creditors will receive only about 12.42% of what they are \nowed. However, with the exception of his student loans, they will not be legally able to \npursue him for their remaining balances. Even so, given his history of credit overextension \nand his late payments on his car loan from September 2017 to January 2019, his ten \nmonths of bankruptcy payments provide insufficient assurance that his financial problems \nare safely behind him and that he can be counted on to manage his finances responsibly in \nthe future. He testified that he has about $3,700 in combined checking and savings \ndeposits and yet he needed the help of family members to make his mortgage payment in \nFebruary 2020. His new job is an increase in salary to $130,000 annually, but given his \nserious history of financial mismanagement, a longer period of compliance with his \nbankruptcy plan is needed to fully mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern about sexual behavior is articulated in AG \u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior includes \nconduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or written \ntransmission. No adverse inference concerning the standings in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n \n \nOn complaint of a 16-year-old female friend of his daughter that Applicant made \ninappropriate comments of a sexual nature to her, exposed himself, and then masturbated \nin her presence. Applicant was arrested in September 2016 and charged with three crimes \nof a sexual nature: felony lewd conduct, open and gross; misdemeanor indecent exposure; \nand misdemeanor accost/annoy another person. Such conduct, if true, would clearly \nimplicate AG \u00b6 13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual \nhas been prosecuted.\u201d \n\n15 \n \n \nApplicant denies any validity to the charges, which he attributes to the girl\u2019s mental \nhealth issues and her history of similar unsubstantiated complaints against others. He \npresented no corroborating documentation to support his claims that the girl suffers from a \nmental illness for which she takes medication and has been psychiatrically hospitalized. \nAvailable court records do show that the case was dismissed with prejudice, however, \nwhich would suggest that the prosecution had some doubt about whether it could prove its \ncase beyond a reasonable doubt. Applicant was allowed to retain custody of his three \nteenage daughters, so apparently the state\u2019s Department of Children and Families (DCF) \nwas persuaded that Applicant was not a risk to his own children. \n \n \nSexual behavior may have security significance, notwithstanding dismissal of \ncriminal charges. The burden is on the Government to prove by substantial evidence that \nApplicant engaged in sexual behavior of the type contemplated within AG \u00b6 12. See \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14. Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the \nsame record.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 18-00754 (App. Bd. June 17, 2019). \n \n \nThe reason for the dismissal of the charges is not stated in the criminal record in \nevidence. In response to the SOR amendment, Applicant indicated in September 2019 that \nafter the prosecutor and his own attorney reviewed a record from a mental health hospital, \nwhere the girl was admitted for several months, and DCF reports, the prosecutor and his \nattorney asked that his case be dismissed. Although he claims he was briefed about what \nwas in the reports, he did not provide details. I did not have the opportunity to assess the \ncredibility of the teenage girl, but her account to the police was similar to what she told her \nsister as soon as she arrived home that day. There is no apparent reason why she would \nmake false accusations against Applicant, given her friendship with his daughter. A mental \nillness could explain her behavior, but the only information in that regard is from Applicant, \nwhose credibility is somewhat suspect because of his disparate versions of what happened \nthat day. \n \n \nWhen questioned by the police, Applicant denied that he exposed himself to the \nteenager, but he also stated that he and the teenager were upstairs; that she made some \ncomment about something \u201ckinky;\u201d and that she then looked at her phone and left. \nApplicant discrepantly told an OPM investigator in April 2018 that he was charged with \nindecent exposure after the teenage girl, who had mental health issues, came over to his \nhouse and walked by his bedroom while he was drying off after a shower. His door was \nbarely ajar, so she must have opened the door. At his March 2020 hearing, Applicant \ninitially testified that, at the request of his daughter, he agreed to pay her friend for some \npainting, covering the pool, and yard work around his house; that his daughter was called \ninto work and not home when the girl came over; that he met the girl at the front door and \ntold her that she could return in the afternoon if she wished. He claimed that she mumbled \nsomething under her breath and then left the house. When asked about the discrepancy \nbetween that account and what he told the OPM investigator, Applicant responded: \n \nThat could have happened before because I was trying to recall that my \ndaughter has a whole bunch of friends. And this is a girl that has come over \n\n16 \n \nto our house a couple of times before. And I know that they were in our pool \nand they were upstairs. And they were all, you know, changing and what \nhave you. And you know, I\u2019m in my master bedroom, you know, and I could \nhave \u2014 this is what I\u2019m recalling. I think that something that may have \nhappened a few days earlier where I was in my shower and she was upstairs \nin my daughter\u2019s room. And I think she may have seen me through my door \nbeing, you know, ajar. . . .\u201d And I believe that, that\u2019s the story that she went \nhome and told her older sister. \n \n \nApplicant persisted in denying that the girl was upstairs with him on the day in \nquestion, which directly contradicts what he told the police. He maintained that the girl \nconfused it with another incident where she may have seen him drying off after a shower, \nbut it would not explain why he had told the OPM investigator that she had seen him after a \nshower. What can reasonably be gleaned from the inconsistent accounts is that Applicant \nallowed the girl into his home to perform some chores when his daughters were not home, \nand that he was upstairs alone with the teen when he said or did something that made her \nrun home and complain with some hysteria about him to her sister. The evidence falls \nsomewhat short of proving that he intentionally exposed himself or engaged in lewd \nbehavior toward her. While Guideline D security concerns are not adequately established, \nhis inconsistent accounts of what transpired that day raise concerns about his judgment \nthat cannot be ignored under the whole-person evaluation.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nApplicant is commended for his years of military service and for his dedication to his \ndaughters. His desire to provide a stable life for them after his divorce likely contributed to \nsome irresponsible financial decisions, including not filing his federal income tax returns \nwhen they were due for tax years 2015 and 2016. Those delinquent income tax returns \nhave been filed, and his past-due taxes are included in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan \napproved in July 2019. Yet, he owes some $68,206 in defaulted federal student loans that \nwill survive the bankruptcy, and he has yet to demonstrate a track record of sound financial \ndecisions. He responded negatively on his SF 86 to inquiries concerning any delinquency \ninvolving routine accounts when he owed more than $140,000 in past-due balances. The \n\n17 \n \nGovernment must be able to rely on the representations of those persons granted access \nto classified information, and Applicant raised considerable doubts about whether he can \nbe counted on to provide full and frank answers. It is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against \nthe grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 \n(9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the evidence \npresented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 30, 2017. \nOn May 21, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations). The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions \nissued on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 11, 2019, with the assistance of an \nattorney. He requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of \n\n \n2 \n \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on December 9, 2019, and the \nhearing was convened on January 14, 2020. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant objected to GE 5, a summary of his \npersonal subject interview. The objection was sustained, and the document was not \nadmitted. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C, which \nwere admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s brother testified on his behalf. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on January 24, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old heavy equipment operator for a defense contractor, \nemployed since December 2017. Applicant previously worked as a teacher and coach for \n17 years, and a school principal for two years before retiring from education in 1999. He \nthen started a business in farm and home construction. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 1981 and a master\u2019s degree in 1987. He married in 1976, but his spouse died in 2003. \nHe remarried in 2005 and divorced in 2008. He again married in 2016. He has three adult \nchildren, none of whom live with him. He has never held a final security clearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has a $10,901 judgment, with a balance owed of \n$21,058 including post-judgment penalties, fees, and interest. The Government\u2019s exhibits \nand Applicant\u2019s Answer and testimony support the SOR allegation. \n \nApplicant purchased a truck in 2001, and financed it through an auto company \ncreditor. Following the purchase, he began to have significant problems with the truck, \nincluding blown spark plugs, three brake replacements within 30,000 miles, and fuel \nsystem problems. He was unsuccessful in having the vehicle declared a lemon, and was \nunable to get support from the dealer. In 2003, he gave up the truck in a voluntarily \nrepossession with 45,000 miles on it, and it was sold at auction. That was the same year \nhis spouse passed away.  \n \nIn 2005, the lender sent Applicant an invoice for about $10,000. He contacted the \nlender in 2006, and offered to settle. The lender told Applicant that the loan had been \nforgiven, but offered new financing to purchase another vehicle. He accepted the new \nloan for $28,000, and purchased another truck. Applicant believed the debt was resolved \nat that time. He paid off his second and a third loan, and did not hear from the lender \nagain.  \n \nIn 2017, Applicant was served with a writ of garnishment issued against him for \n$19,802 that resulted from a 2011 judgment to collect $11,040 from his original truck loan. \nThe garnishment order included penalties, fees, and interest on the original judgment \namount. He was never notified of the judgment proceedings, did not participate in a \njudicial proceeding, and was unaware of the garnishment proceeding until he was served \nwith the writ of garnishment. By November 2018, the balance due became $21,058 with \ninterest accruing at 8.75% per year.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant believes the account to be a resurrected \u201cghost\u201d account, obtained by a \ncollection agent and enforced by obtaining a judgment. In 2017, Applicant\u2019s employer \ngarnished his wages, and paid $7,000 over five months. Applicant attempted to contact \nthe collection agent, but was unable to talk to a person. He again tried in 2018, but a \nrecording directs inquiries to an online site. An attorney for the collection agent contacted \nApplicant in November 2018, and offered to discuss a payment plan. Applicant spoke to \nan attorney in 2019, who suggested he obtain the district court documents. He obtained \nthe documents and is awaiting the attorney\u2019s review. \n \nApplicant provided an article from a free online credit repair advice site that \ndescribed the collection agent as a \u201cjunk buyer that buys up old debt from the banks, . . . \nfor pennies on the dollar. They have a history of unscrupulous debt collection practices.\u201d \nAnother article noted that the collection agent was sued in a class action suit in 2014 \nclaiming the agent engaged in several improper debt collection practices, including suing \ndebtors without sufficient evidence, making false statements in court documents, and not \nproviding notice to defendants while representing to the court that they had. Between \n2005 and 2007, the agent filed 60,000 mass debt collections in New York City, and won \n48,000 judgments. In one week, they sued 1,200 persons alone. However, only 6% of the \ndefendants appeared in court. The agent settled the class action suit, paid nearly $4 \nmillion into a fund for class members, and agreed to stop related collection actions. \n \nThe judgment and garnishment order do not appear on Applicant\u2019s credit report. \nHe has sufficient income and assets to pay the account, but believes it was fraudulently \nobtained and is awaiting his attorney\u2019s advice. Applicant earns about $56,000 net \nannually and receives a state retirement paying about $10,000 annually. He has about \n$1,700 net remainder per month. He has $2,000 in savings, and owns outright a home, \nfarm, two rental homes, motor home, four vehicles, and farm equipment. With Applicant\u2019s \nbackground in construction, he volunteered to build low income houses for church and \ncharitable organizations. Applicant provided several character letters from previous \nsupervisors and coworkers, all attesting to his honesty, trustworthiness, and \nprofessionalism. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \n\n \n4 \n \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \n\n \n5 \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s has an aged debt on a truck that he thought was a lemon, was \nvoluntarily relinquished for auction and believed to be resolved with the lender. The old \ndebt was resurrected by a collection agent that has a history of unscrupulous debt \ncollection practices. Applicant is in the process of disputing the debt and judgment, and \nhas sought advice of counsel. The judgment and garnishment do not appear on his \ncurrent credit report. Applicant has significant financial resources, so the likelihood of \nbeing a victim of financial blackmail is low. Overall, Applicant\u2019s financial status does not \nraise concerns about his debts, financial management decisions, and ability to address \nfuture obligations. I am not concerned that Applicant will ever compromise classified \ninformation because of this aged and questionable debt and judgment. His financial status \ndoes not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Mitigating \nconditions under \u00b6\u00b6 20 (a) and (b) apply. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s personal and employment history, and his current financial resources. I \nremain convinced that he is financially responsible and can meet future financial \nobligations. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s \napplication for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

A Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nwas issued under Guideline F, financial considerations, alleging 31 delinquent accounts, \nwhich totaled approximately $63,000. She has paid some of her delinquent obligations, \nhas repayment agreements to address additional debts, and is waiting until she is \nfinancially stable enough to enter into repayment agreements to address the remaining \ndebts. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn May 24, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, financial considerations, under which it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for her.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nThe DoD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn June 18, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On December 12, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing \nconducted on January 16, 2020.  \n \nSix Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 6) and 24 Applicant\u2019s exhibits (Ex. A \u2013 W and Ex. \nDD) were admitted into evidence without objection. The record was held open following \nthe hearing to allow Applicant to supplement the record. On April 5, 2020, Applicant \nsubmitted additional documents, which were received and admitted, without objection, as \nEx. X \u2013 CC and Ex. EE \u2013 II. Applicant testified at the hearing, as reflected in a transcript \n(Tr.) received on January 29, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she denied one medical account ($840) and \nindicated that five delinquent accounts were duplication of other delinquent debts. She \nadmitted the other delinquent accounts listed in the SOR. After a thorough review of the \ntestimony, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.  \nApplicant is a 59-year-old risk management team lead who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since July 2000 and seeks to retain a security clearance. (Tr. 16, Ex. \n1) A top secret clearance was issued to her in 1996. (Tr. 17) In June 1995, Applicant \ndivorced following a ten-year marriage. (Tr. 19, Ex. 1) She has two children ages 29 and \n31. (Tr. 18) She has not served in the military. Her annual salary is $132,000. (Tr. 23, 64) \nShe also has a part-time job doing photography. (Tr. 24) She anticipates a five percent \nraise this year, the same percentage as she received last year. (Tr. 73) \nBetween 2011 and mid-2015, Applicant was the primary breadwinner for her \nhousehold, which consisted of her two children, her mother who suffered from \ndementia/Alzheimer\u2019s, her mother\u2019s grandson who had been under her mother\u2019s care and \nher sister, her sister\u2019s two children, and her sister\u2019s grandson. (Tr. 19) In May 2004, her \nmother and her mother\u2019s grandson moved in with her. (Tr. 44) In 2011, Applicant, who \nwas timely in paying her bills, began reading up on credit. (Tr. 52) She then started \nacquiring credit cards. Most of the credit cards listed as SOR delinquents debts were \nacquired by Applicant between 2012 and 2014. (Ex. 4, 5, 6) Her mother\u2019s and her sister\u2019s \nincome were included in the household income to meet the household\u2019s expenses. Her \nmother\u2019s income consisted of a pension and social security benefits. (Tr. 44) When her \nmother died in January 2015, and her sister moved out of the home, Applicant realized \nshe could not pay her debts. (Tr. 20) She paid her mother\u2019s funeral expenses. (Tr. 67)  \n\n \n3 \nApplicant now lives in her home alone. (Tr. 57) She helps her sister financially \nwhen she can. Her sister is 66 years old, lives on a fixed income, and suffers from \npancreatic cancer. (Tr. 70) Every Friday, Applicant takes time off from work to take her \nsister to her chemotherapy and radiation treatment and give her sister\u2019s children a break. \n(Tr. 71) She provides her sister approximately $100 each month in financial support. \nIn August 2018, Applicant provided an enhanced subject interview during which \nher delinquent finances were discussed. (Ex. 4, Tr. 54) During that interview, she said \nshe was \u201cvery prideful\u201d and chose not to ask for help with her credit issues because she \nthought that as an adult she should be able to handle her finances. (Tr. 20) She was \ncurrent on her mortgage and car payments. She was also paying on one of the credit \ncards. Her mortgage caused her some financial stress in that her monthly mortgage \npayments began going up $100 per month each year, and one year her payments jumped \n$250 per month. (Tr. 20) Her monthly mortgage payment is currently $2,249. (Tr. 23) \nDuring the summer, her electric bill can run $2,500 per month. (Tr. 23)  \n \n \nApplicant considered selling her home and using the equity in the home to address \nher debts. However, she would have then had to buy a smaller home with a loan requiring \nrepayment similar to her current mortgage payments. (Tr. 21) She also considered selling \nher home and moving in temporarily with her daughter. She owes approximately \n$202,000 on her home that has a fair market value of $320,000. (Tr. 22) She purchased \nher home in 2011. She had purchased the home in cooperation with her then boyfriend. \nThey anticipated marriage, and she counted on both incomes to meet her mortgage \npayments, utility bills, and other living expenses. When the relationship ended, Applicant \nwas left having to pay the household expenses on her income alone.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges she could have and should have made better decisions \nconcerning her finances. (Tr. 108) However, she takes responsibility for her actions and \nintends to pay her debts. She provided extensive details about her debts, showing that \nshe is fully aware of her financial situation. (Tr. 109) Department Counsel conceded that \nwhen she did act to address her debts, \u201cshe acted with great earnest in attempting [to \naddress] these accounts.\u201d (Tr. 110) He also acknowledged Applicant was forthright about \nher past and providing details of her financial difficulties. (Tr. 110)  \n \nApplicant plans to retire in four or five years and does not want to enter retirement \nwith large debts. (Tr. 22, 53) She is keenly aware she could lose her job due to her \ndelinquent financial obligations. (Tr. 53) Last year, she attended budgeting workshops \nthrough her sorority. (Tr. 25, 63) She has access through her church to the Dave Ramsey \nPeace University financial studies books. She has started a budget, but believes she \nneeds additional guidance to help her through her financial problems. Applicant sought \nlegal services to assist her with her financial problems. After being quoted $21,000 for the \nservices, she declined to hire the attorney. She decided if she had $21,000, she would \nrather apply those funds to her debts. (Tr. 37) \n \n \nApplicant completed two extensive spread sheets listing all her debts and the \nactions she has taken to address those debts. (Ex. C, Ex. Y) She listed the telephone \nnumbers called, the people she talked with, the repayment agreements that have been \n\n \n4 \nmade, and included those debts where she has yet to reach agreements with the \ncreditors. She is mindful of not overextending herself by entering into too many repayment \nagreements at this time. (Tr. 83) Details of her efforts to address the SOR debts follow. \n \n \nApplicant owed a collection agency $4,198 on a bank collection debt (SOR 1.a). \nShe reached a repayment agreement with the creditor to make 13 payments of $50 each \nand 24 payments of $150. (Ex. A) Since May 2019, she has made her monthly payments \nin a timely manner. (Tr. 27) The payments are automatically deducted from her bank \naccount. (Tr. 28) As of March 2020, the current balance was $3,697. (Ex. Y, Ex. Z)  \n \nApplicant also owed $2,978 on a charged-off credit card account (SOR 1.e). She \nreached an agreement with the law firm collecting the debt whereby she agreed to make \n13 payments of $50 and 14 payments of $150. (Ex. E) In June 2019, she started making \npayments, and by April 2020 the balance on the debt had been reduced to $1,724. (Ex. \nC, Ex. Y, Ex. Z) \n \n \nApplicant reached an agreement with this same law firm to address another SOR \ndebt. She agreed to make 13 monthly payments of $50 and 7 payments of $150 to \naddress a $1,672 collection account (SOR 1.n). (Ex. N) She started making her payments \nin June 2019. (Ex. N, Tr. 30) As of April 2020, the balance on the account had been \nreduced to $820. (Ex. Y, Ex. Z) She credibly asserts the debt in SOR 1.n and SOR 1.p \nare the same obligation. (Ex. Y) She also has made payments to the same law firm to \nresolve a $1,091 department store debt (SOR 1.s). In November 2019, the judgment on \nthis debt was released. (Ex. S, Tr. 30)  \n \n \nApplicant owed a collection agency $2,658 on a bank collection debt (SOR 1.g). \nShe reached a repayment agreement with the creditor to make $50 monthly payments on \nthe debt. (Tr. 29, Ex. Y) She started making payments in May 2019. (Ex. G) As of March \n2020, the balance was $2,131. (Ex. Z) She reached agreement with the same collection \nagency to make payments on four other SOR debts. In June 2019, she started paying \n$13.96 monthly on an $838 collection debt (SOR 1.t). (Ex. T-1, T-2, Tr. 31) As of March \n2020, the balance was $712. (Ex. BB) In June 2019, she also started making $12.62 \nmonthly payments on a $758 collection debt (SOR 1.u). (Ex. U, Tr. 32) As of April 2020, \nthe balance on the account was $644. (Ex. Y, Ex. BB) At the same time, she also started \nmaking $12.58 monthly payments on a $755 collection debt (SOR 1.v). (Ex. V, Tr. 32) As \nof April 2020, the balance on the account was $666. (Ex. Y, Ex. BB) The payments on \nthe debts in SOR 1.t, 1.u, and 1.v are made by automatic deduction from her bank \naccount. (Tr. 31) In June, July, and August 2019, she made three payments of $120.85 \neach to pay off the $363 bank collection account (SOR 1.w). (Ex. W, Ex. Y, Tr. 32)  \n \n  \nApplicant resolved the $2,327 collection account that was originally owed an on-\nline retailer (SOR 1.i). The accounts numbers verify the collection account listed in the \nSOR was the same account as the on-line seller\u2019s account. As of June 2019, this account \nhad been paid leaving a zero balance. (Ex. I, Tr. 29) She reached an agreement with the \ncollection firm collecting the $1,753 (SOR 1.m) debt, whereby starting in July 2019, \n$62.50 would be automatically deducted monthly from her bank account bi-weekly. (Ex. \nM, Tr. 30) The debt balance as of April 2020 was $682. (Ex. Y) She asserts the debt listed \n\n \n5 \nin SOR 1.m is the same debt as SOR 1.o, for which she has arranged a repayment \nagreement. (Tr. 31) All three debts are being collected by the same collection agency for \nthe same bank.  \n \nRegarding the alleged medical debts, Applicant incurred a medical emergency at \nwork. Her blood pressure was very high, and she also had vertigo. It was thought she \nwas having a heart attack. (Tr. 33) She was taken by ambulance to the hospital for \ntreatment. She paid the $425 medical debt (SOR 1.dd). (Ex. DD) She also paid $315 to \nsettle the $360 medical bill (SOR 1.x). (Ex. B, Tr. 32) She disputes the $840 medical debt \n(SOR 1.cc) for dental work. After x-rays were taken, she was informed the dental \ntreatment would cost $8,000. She decided not to have the procedures done. (Tr. 101) \nShe had dental insurance to cover the cost of the x-rays. (Ex. Y) The bill for services \nrendered will be paid once the proper paperwork is submitted. (Tr. 34, 101) \n \nThe $5,900 loan (SOR 1.z) was paid. (Ex. D, Tr. 35) She had obtained the personal \nloan with a now ex-boyfriend, when she moved into her home, and she paid it over the \ncourse of five years. (Tr. 36, 91) Her April 2019 credit report lists a zero balance for this \naccount. (Ex. 6) She paid the $116 charged-off telephone service account (SOR 1.y) (Ex. \nY, Tr. 91)  \n \n \n \nApplicant has not made any payments toward some accounts, including the $3,422 \ncharged-off account listed in SOR 1.d, which is likely duplicated in SOR 1.bb. (Tr. 39, 77) \nDepartment Counsel acknowledged the $4,087 charged-off account in SOR 1.b and the \n$4,087 charged-off account in SOR 1.aa are the same debt. (Tr. 96) Her plan is to address \ndebts and any additional debts that are not currently in a repayment plan as soon as those \ndebts being repaid through established plans have been satisfied. (Tr. 57, 76) The $2,848 \ncharged-off account (SOR 1.f), $2,422 (SOR 1.h) collection account, and the $1,821 \ncharged-off account (SOR 1.l) are to be included in the next round of payments (phase II \nof her payment plans). (Ex. Y, Tr. 99) Her plan is to address the smaller debts before \nattempting to pay the larger debts. (Tr. 100) She asserted the debt listed in SOR 1.c \n($3,590) may also be a duplicate debt, but provided no proof that the debt is otherwise \nalleged in the SOR. (Tr. 76) Since December 2019, she has made eight payments of \n$62.50 each on this debt. (Ex. AA)  \n \nThe same collection agency attempting to collect the debt listed in SOR 1.c is also \ncollecting seven other SOR debts. Applicant contacted the collection agency and was told \nthe collection agency no longer holds the debt listed in SOR 1.c. She is talking with the \ncollection agency to consolidate the accounts held by the agency so that she can make \na single payment. (Ex. Y) \n \n \nApplicant made two monthly $50 payments on the $2,013 charged-off bank \naccount (SOR 1.k). (Ex. CC, Tr. 81) She never received a statement from the creditor \nfollowing her payments, so she stopped making payments. (Tr. 83) She contacted the \nbank concerning the debt on learning from the collection entity that it no longer held the \ndebt. (Tr. 83) If contacted by a new collection agency, she intends to arrange a repayment \nplan. She was also making $50 monthly payments on a $1,278 department store account \n(SOR 1.q). (Tr. 87) She believes the debt has been transferred to another collection \n\n \n6 \nagency. Applicant asserted she had cancelled checks showing payments on this debt \nand on the $1,265 charged-off department store account (SOR 1.r). (Ex. CC, Tr. 89) She \nmade a few payments before stopping because she received no acknowledgement of her \npayments. However, the checks she sent were processed. (Tr. 90)  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges that she should have taken prompt action to resolve her \ndebts following her August 2018 subject interview, but she felt overwhelmed. (Tr. 56) She \nfound the SOR to be a wake-up call that led her to realize that she had to get her finances \nunder control. She now maintains only a single credit card, and she makes timely monthly \npayments on that account. (Tr. 60) \n \n \nApplicant asserts she is current on her $537 monthly car payment. As of April 2020, \nthe balance owed on her loan is approximated $1,000. (Ex. II) The car will be paid off in \ntwo months, providing her with an additional $537 of monthly disposable income. (Tr. 42, \n106) She has approximately $300,000 in her company\u2019s 401(k) retirement account. (Tr. \n66) She had obtained a $10,000 loan from her 401(k) account to pay her mother\u2019s funeral \nexpenses. She has been repaying the loan at $156 monthly for the last five years. (Tr. \n105) The debt will be shortly paid in full leaving her with $156 more in monthly disposable \nincome. She has filed her income tax returns in a timely manner. Last year, she received \na tax refund of a few thousand dollars, which she applied to her debts. (Tr. 102) \n \n \nApplicant has always been responsible at work, ensuring that deadlines are timely \nmet. (Tr. 58) Applicant\u2019s 2019 performance form shows that she was rated as having \nexceeded the position\u2019s requirements. (Ex. EE) Her 2018 performance form shows a \nrating of having exceeded expectations. (Ex. EE). In October 2018, she received a \n\u201cRecognition Thanks Award\u201d and a \u201cRecognition Kudos Award\u201d from her employer. (Ex. \nFF) In October 2019, she was recognized for her leadership and in January 2020, she \nreceived another \u201cRecognition Kudos Award.\u201d (Ex. FF) She is also active in volunteer \nwork at her work place. (Ex. HH) \n \nCharacter Statement \n \nA criminal district court judge, who has known Applicant for 12 years, stated \nApplicant is \u201cconstantly on the go with individuals and groups as a volunteer who gives \nback to the community at large which makes her leadership evident both internally within \nour organization as well as externally within the surrounding communities.\u201d (Ex. GG) He \nstated Applicant displays outstanding character, loyalty, trustworthiness, dependability, \nand reliability. He also stated Applicant is an articulate and dynamic woman with high \nintegrity, good moral character, and dedicated to the community she serves. (Ex. GG) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n7 \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n\n \n8 \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nApplicant is alleged to have owed 31 delinquent obligations totaling approximately \n$63,000. It is noted that some of the debts listed in the SOR are duplications of other \nlisted debts. AG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions, which could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d \u201c(b) \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d  \n \n  \nApplicant admitted the delinquent obligations in the SOR with the caveat of some \nduplication, except for one medical bill for dental services. The record having established \nthe aforesaid disqualifying conditions, additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions is required. Applicant has the burden of establishing that matters in \nmitigation apply. Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n9 \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nThe Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that she \nhas paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). The Appeal Board stated in ISCR \nCase No. 17-00263 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan \nfor debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences \na serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d Applicant has paid some of her debts, is making \npayment on others, disputes a dental bill, and plans to establish repayment agreements \non the remaining debts when she is financially able to do so. She is very cognizant of her \nfinancial situation and does not want to become financially overextended by entering into \ntoo many repayment agreements immediately. \n \nA number of the debts were incurred when Applicant was receiving additional \nincome when her mother and sister were living with her. When her mother died and her \nsister left her home, not only was there less income to address her debts, but she also \nincurred a $10,000 debt for her mother\u2019s burial expenses. These expenses are unlikely \nto recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) has some applicability.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were contributed to by the loss of the income \nsupplied by her mother and by her having to pay her mother\u2019s burial expenses. \nAdditionally, she purchased her home anticipating the income of her and her boyfriend. \nThe income from her boyfriend to meet living expenses and to assist with the mortgage \npayments ended when their relationship ended. Additionally, her monthly mortgage \npayments have gone up $100 per month each year, and one year increased by $250 per \nmonth. Additionally, her electric bill can be unusually high during certain months of the \nyear. Therefore, some of the debts were caused by conditions largely beyond her control, \nto which AG \u00b6 20(b) is applicable. \n \nApplicant has obtained financial counseling through her church, her sorority\u2019s \nworkshop, and the Dave Ramsey financial advice program. She has completed two \nextensive spread sheets listing all her debts and the actions she has taken to address \nthose debts. The spread sheets show her understanding of her financial obligations and \ndocuments a viable plan to address her debts.  \nApplicant\u2019s delay in addressing her debts is not condoned. Initially, Applicant was \n\u201cvery prideful\u201d and chose not to ask for help because she thought that as an adult she \nshould be able to handle her finances. Even though she was current on her mortgage, \nher car payments, and her payment on one of her credit card, she knew she had to do \nmore to address her finances. She anticipates retiring in five or six years and does not \nwhat to have delinquent debt when she retires.  \n \nApplicant acknowledges she could have and should have made better decisions \nconcerning her finances. However, she began taking responsibility for her actions in 2019 \n\n \n10 \nand has taken substantial steps toward resolving her debts, demonstrating thereby her \nintention to pay her debts. She provided, in great detail, her understanding of her \naccounts. Department Counsel conceded that when she did act to address her debts, \n\u201cshe acted with great earnest in attempting [to address] these accounts.\u201d He also \nacknowledged Applicant was forthright about her past and providing details of her \nfinancial difficulties. Applicant has received financial counseling, and with clear indications \nher financial problems are being resolved, AG \u00b6 20(c) applies. \n \nApplicant has paid off seven of the SOR debts: SOR 1.i, 1.s, 1.w, 1.x, 1.y, 1.z, and \n1.dd. She has arranged repayment agreements on 11 other debts: SOR 1.a, 1.e, 1.g, 1.k, \n1.m (which is also 1.o), 1.n (which is also 1.p), 1.t, 1.u, and 1.v. In addition to the two \nduplicate debts already listed (SOR 1.m/1.o and SOR 1.n/1.p) the debts in SOR 1.b and \n1.aa and the debts in 1.d and 1.bb are duplicate debts. Given Applicant has paid some of \nher delinquent obligations and is making payments in accord with repayment \narrangements on other obligations, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these debts.  \n \nApplicant disputes the dental bill (SOR 1.cc, $840) because she had dental \ninsurance that should have covered the cost of the x-rays. After the x-rays, she chose not \nto follow through with the $8,000 of dental work suggested. She has a reasonable basis \nto dispute the legitimacy of this debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to this debt.  \nNot all of Applicant\u2019s delinquent obligations have been paid or are currently being \npaid. She has yet to enter into agreements to repay the remaining eight debts. She has \nwisely chosen not to over extend herself by attempting to address all her debts at once. \nShe has paid some and is making payment on others. In the next two months, both her \n401(k) loan and her car will be paid off. This will provide her with $693 more each month \nto address her delinquent obligations. Having viewed her spread sheets, her approach to \naddressing her debts, and the steps she has already taken, I believe she will continue \nmaking her payments in accord with the repayment agreements she has already \nestablished and will arrange new repayment agreements on those debts not in repayment \nwhen she is financially able to do so.  \n \nApplicant has made monthly payments on several accounts since June 2019, by \nautomatic withdrawal from her bank accounts. Her timely payments for almost a year are \npersuasive evidence that she will continue the repayment agreements to completion. The \nmore payments an applicant has made, the more likely it is that they will continue with the \npayments.  \n \nAn applicant is not required to establish that she has paid each of the delinquent \ndebts in the SOR. However, an applicant needs to show that she has a plan to resolve \nher debts and that she has taken significant steps to implement her plan. This she has \ndone. The financial considerations security concerns are sufficiently mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n11 \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. The comments under Guideline F are incorporated in the whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. Applicant realizes she \ncould have and should have made better decisions concerning her finances. She takes \nresponsibility for her actions and intends to pay her debts. She provided in great detail \nher understanding of her accounts and how she intends to pay them. I agree with \nDepartment Counsel that when she did act to address her debts, she acted with great \nearnest in attempting to address these accounts. I also agree that Applicant has been \nforthright about her past and providing details of her financial difficulties. \n \n \nIn making a determination as to an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation I must consider whether Applicant has been truthful and complete in response \nto questions; whether, she has sought assistance in addressing her financial problems; \nwhether, she has or it appears likely that she will favorably resolve the security concern; \nand whether she has demonstrated positive changes in behavior to address her financial \nproblems. (Directive, June 8, 2007, Appendix A, & 2(f)) I find in Applicant\u2019s favor as to \nthese considerations. \n \nThe law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, have \nbeen carefully applied to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid, it is whether \nApplicant\u2019s financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts about her eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.ee:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/03/2020 \nDecision \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 26, 2016. On \nAugust 5, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 22, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On September 16, 2019, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding documents identified as Items 1 through 5. He was given an opportunity to \nsubmit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, \n\n \n2 \n \nmitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on \nSeptember 25, 2019, and did not respond. Item 1 contains the pleadings in the case. \nItems 2 through 5 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 26, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. He divorced his wife of six years in 2003. He has been \nmarried to his second wife since 2005. He has four minor children. He served honorably \non active duty in the U.S. Army from 1994 through 2001, and from 2005 until August \n2008, when he was medically discharged for reasons not specified in the record. From \n2001 through 2005, he was on inactive reserve duty. He was previously granted a DOD \nsecurity clearance in 2007. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. Applicant has been \nemployed by the same defense contractor since March 2016. (Item 2) \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s 11 delinquent debts totaling approximately $32,977, \nand that he deliberately failed to disclose any of them on his SCA. Applicant admitted \neach of the alleged debts, which remain unresolved. I construed his failure to respond to \nthe falsification allegation as a denial of any deliberate intent to falsify his SCA.  \n \nThe SOR debts were confirmed by his November 2016 and April 2019 credit \nreports. The November 2016 credit report revealed that 10 of the 11 SOR debts were \nthen in delinquent status, including: 1) one past due since January 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); 2) \nfour in charged-off status, including one since March 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), one since \nFebruary 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and two since May 2016 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h); and 3) five in \ncollection status (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k). The last dates of activity for the \ncollection debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.k were reported as March 2015, \nJune 2015, August 2015, and July 2014, respectively. The April 2019 credit report \nrevealed that the mortgage-loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was then approximately 30 \ndays delinquent. (Items 4, 5) \n \nApplicant certified his \u201cno\u201d responses to whether he had any financial \ndelinquencies on his SCA in July 2016. He was interviewed in September 2018 in \nconnection with his security-clearance investigation to discuss the contents of his SCA. \nDuring his interview, Applicant initially reaffirmed his \u201cno\u201d response. He acknowledged \nhis delinquent debts only after being confronted with 10 of the 11 debts alleged in the \nSOR. He provided inconsistent explanations for his failure to list them on his SCA. He \nasserted that \u201che was not aware of\u201d all of the accounts with which he had been \nconfronted. Then, he averred that his omissions were an \u201coversight.\u201d He asserted that \nhe planned to contact his creditors and make arrangements to resolve his delinquent \naccounts within 90 days. He maintained that he was current with his ongoing financial \nobligations and living \u201cat or below his means.\u201d (Item 3 at 5-6) \n \nDuring the interview, Applicant attributed his financial situation primarily to a \nperiod of underemployment following a job change. He did not specify a timeline or \nprovide further details. He explained that he began to accumulate debt \u201caround the \ntime\u201d that he changed jobs. He was late on payments before the job change, and then \n\n \n3 \n \nfell further behind because his income decreased following the change. He became \n\u201coverwhelmed\u201d by his bills and struggled to make the monthly payments to his creditors. \nAfter being confronted during the interview, he acknowledged that he withdrew money \nfrom his 401k in June 2016 to \u201cpay bills,\u201d the amount of which was $11,900 after taxes. \nHe did not specify how that money was allocated. (Item 3 at 5-6) \n \nThe employment history on Applicant\u2019s SCA revealed two periods of \nunemployment. The first was from August 2008 through January 2009, following his \nmilitary discharge. The second was from February 2016 through March 2016, after his \ndefense-contractor employer lost the contract on which he was working. He has \notherwise been employed full time since January 2009. The record did not enumerate \nhis relevant income and expense history. (Item 2 at 10-16) \n \n       Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his credit reports establish the following disqualifying \nconditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant has substantial delinquent debts that remain unresolved. He failed to \ndemonstrate that he acted responsibly to address them. He has been employed full time \nin his current position since March 2016 and accessed $11,900 from his 401k in June \n2016. Applicant has neither resolved any of the debts alleged in the SOR nor \nestablished a plan to address them. Exacerbated by his failure to respond to the FORM, \nthe record contains insufficient detail and documentation to explain not only why his \ndebts occurred, but also why they have persisted. Thus, I cannot conclude that \nApplicant has mitigated the Guideline F concerns.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of his SCA, the following \ndisqualifying condition under this guideline could apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative \njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an Appellant\u2019s state \nof mind at the time of the omission. (ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, \n2004). An applicant\u2019s level of education and experience are relevant to determining \nwhether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance application \nwas deliberate. (ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010)) \n \nI did not find credible Applicant\u2019s explanations for failing to report his known \nderogatory financial information on his SCA. Even if he did not know the details of each \nand every debt, he had been struggling with his finances to the point of making a \nsubstantial withdrawal from his 401k a month prior to certifying his SCA. Moreover, his \nNovember 2016 credit report revealed that at least 9 of the 11 alleged debts would have \nbeen in a reportable delinquent status when he certified his SCA in July 2016. I find \nsubstantial evidence of an intent by the Applicant to omit security-significant facts from \nhis SCA. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is established as to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nthrough 1.i and 1.k. \n \nNeither of the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nAn applicant's completion of a security questionnaire is the initial step in \nrequesting a security clearance and the investigative process is contingent upon the \nhonesty of the applicant. Beginning with an applicant\u2019s responses in the application, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split \nhairs or parse the truth narrowly. The Federal Government has a \ncompelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information. \nThat compelling interest includes the government's legitimate interest in \nbeing able to make sound decisions (based on complete and accurate \ninformation) about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to \nthe government in connection with a security clearance investigation or \nadjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \n(ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002)) \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his known financial delinquencies on his SCA was \nsecurity significant. The fact that he initially reaffirmed his \u201cno\u201d responses during his \nsecurity clearance interview and only admitted them after confrontation undercuts \nmitigation. I have doubts about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment.  \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his financial delinquencies and personal conduct. Accordingly, \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant defaulted on a credit-card debt and a medical bill. He provided \nevidence in mitigation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 16, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) \nseeking to renew a previously granted clearance. On June 7, 2019, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended (Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG) effective for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nOn July 9, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have the case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. He admitted the credit-card allegation \n\n2 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) with an explanation in mitigation. He also represented that he had made \narrangements with the creditor to repay the debt through a payment plan. He denied the \nmedical-debt allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.b) on the ground that he was unaware of this debt and \nafter a diligent effort to identify the creditor, was unable to do so. \n \nOn September 25, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase in a File of Relevant Material (FORM), which included seven attached documents \nidentified as Items 1-7. A complete copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant, who \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and to submit a written response and \ndocuments to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised by the SOR \nallegations. Within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM, Applicant provided a one-page \nstatement with six attachments in mitigation of the issues raised in the SOR and the \nFORM. I have marked these documents as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through G. \nDepartment Counsel has raised no objections to Applicant\u2019s statement or documentary \nevidence. Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G are, therefore, admitted into the record.  \n \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant raised no objection to the admission of \nFORM Item 4, which included an unauthenticated report of investigation summarizing \nApplicant\u2019s August 20, 2018 background interview. In his FORM, Department Counsel \nhad advised Applicant that he had the right to object to the admissibility of this evidence \nas unauthenticated. Department Counsel also informed Applicant that he could provide \ncorrections and updates to the summary of his interview and that if he failed to object, he \nmay be determined to have waived objections to the admissibility of the interview \nsummary. I conclude that Applicant has waived any objections to the summary of his \nbackground interview. Accordingly, I have included this document in the written record in \nthis case. I have marked Items 1 through 7 attached to the FORM as Government Exhibit \n1-7, respectively. Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 are admitted without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on November 19, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions in his response to the allegations set \nforth in SOR \u00b6 1.a in my findings of fact and have noted his denial of SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 3, his SCA, unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, the Government\u2019s FORM, Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, and the \ndocumentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant, 65, is married and has two adult children. In 1976, at the age of 22, he \nenlisted in the U.S Navy and served on active duty for 16 years, after which he served in \nthe Navy Reserve for another ten years. He was honorably discharged. Since at least \n2006, he has worked for a defense contractor as a mechanical technician. \n \n \nIn or about 2012 or 2013, Applicant\u2019s wife became seriously ill and was unable to \nwork for a period of time. She lost a significant amount of her income during her treatment \nand recovery. As a result, Applicant experienced financial difficulties. He and his wife \n\n3 \n \nused a credit card to bridge the gap between their expenses and their reduced income. \nEventually he defaulted on the credit card though he kept the mortgage on his residence \nin good standing throughout this period. He has also maintained a rental property, which \nhe bought in 2007, without defaulting on any related obligations notwithstanding the 2008 \nhousing recession. (SOR response.) \n \n \nCredit-Card Account Charged-Off in the Amount of $17,143 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \u2013 \nApplicant defaulted on this credit-card account in or about October 2013. He did not list \nthis debt on his SCA. Applicant advised the investigator who conducted his background \ninterview in August 2018 that he had forgotten about the credit card and intended to speak \nwith his wife, who handles their family finances, about contacting the creditor to make \npayment arrangements. He blamed their default on the account on his wife\u2019s loss of \nincome while she was being treated for a serious illness. In his SOR response, he \nrepeated this explanation as the cause of his default on the credit card, and explained \nthat there were other sources of financial demands that caused him and his wife to \nexperience financial difficulties at the time. Applicant advised in his response to the FORM \nthat he \u201creestablished a payment plan with [the credit-card creditor] and have been \nmaking monthly payments.\u201d He also provided a letter from the creditor, dated July 11, \n2019, memorializing the terms of the installment plan, which calls for monthly payments \nof $100 for 172 months. (GE 4 at 3; AE A, F.) \n \n \nMedical Account in Collection in the Amount of $241 (SOR \u00b61.b) \u2013 The SOR \nalleges that this debt appears on Applicant\u2019s March 26, 2019 credit report (GE 6 at 2). \nThe debt also appears in the May 29, 2019 credit report (GE 5), but not in the March 14, \n2018 credit report (GE 7). Neither GE 5 nor GE 6 contain any identifying information that \nwould make it possible to identify the collection agency that holds this debt or the original \nmedical provider. The subject of this debt did not come up in Applicant\u2019s August 20, 2018 \nbackground interview, according to the investigator\u2019s summary, presumably because it \ndid not appear in GE 7. In his SOR answer, Applicant wrote that he was \u201cnot able to find \nany medical organization to whom I owe $241.00.\u201d He wrote further that he contacted the \nonly medical provider of which he was aware, and was advised that he had no outstanding \nbills. When he prepared his response to the FORM, he obtained a copy of his Equifax \ncredit report. He submitted this report, and it contains no identifying information for this \ndebt. He wrote that he called Equifax and was unable to learn anything further that would \nallow him to identify the creditor and pay this bill. He also provided copies of invoices from \nhis hospital and physician, which reflect zero balances. He wrote: \u201cWith such a severe \nlack of information I\u2019m at a loss on what to do.\u201d (GE 5, 6, 7; AE A, C, D, E, G at 1.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n\n4 \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admission in his SOR answer and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n\n6 \n \n \nThe existence of this long-outstanding credit-card debt at the time of the issuance \nof the SOR renders this debt recent. Applicant\u2019s behavior of defaulting on this debt was \ninfrequent and arose out of unusual circumstances, i.e, his wife\u2019s serious illness and loss \nof income. The fact that the bill was not addressed until after Applicant was put on notice \nthat his security clearance was in jeopardy raises concerns about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established.  \n \n \nApplicant claims that the illness of Applicant\u2019s wife resulted in a significant loss of \nincome while she was being treated and during her recovery. Applicant had to use a credit \ncard to pay some of their living expenses. The seriousness of her illness renders \nApplicant\u2019s claims credible. Applicant\u2019s late response in beginning to repay this debt \nundercuts an argument that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. On the other \nhand, he has now taken actions to begin to repay the debt on terms that the creditor has \naccepted. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. \n \n \nApplicant presented no evidence that he received counseling to address his \nfinancial distress either when his wife lost her income due to her illness or more recently. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established.  \n \n \nApplicant has initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his credit-card debt, He has a \nbrief track record of payments under the installment agreement. The small amount of the \npayment makes it credible that he will be financially able to continue making the required \nmonthly payments, which will continue for many years past Applicant\u2019s likely retirement. \nApplicant has also made a good-faith effort to identify the creditor holding the medical \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. There is nothing further Applicant can do about this debt in \nlight of the lack of available information to make it possible for him to pay it. AG \u00b6 20(d) is \nestablished.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n\n7 \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some factors warrant additional \ncomments. Applicant is a mature individual who experienced a life-changing event without \nany serious financial consequences. Just as he weathered the real estate recession in \n2008 without defaulting on his obligations on either his home or a rental property, he \nsuccessfully managed his finances during his wife\u2019s illness and extended loss of income \nwith only one credit-card default. He has also responded to the SOR allegation of a small \nmedical debt in an appropriate and mature manner. The fact, however, that he did not \naddress his credit-card debt until his security clearance and livelihood was at risk weighs \nagainst his evidence in mitigation. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent \ncredit-card debt and medical bill. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 1, 2018. On \nMay 8, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 4, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On December 3, 2019, the Government sent Applicant \na complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 7. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on December 13, \n\n \n2 \n \n2019, and did not respond. Items 1 and 2 are the pleadings in the case. I admitted Items \n3 through 7 into evidence. The case was assigned to me on February 14, 2020. \n \nEvidentiary Matter \n \nItem 5 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I \nconclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 5. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 5 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he \ndid not raise any objection to Item 5 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not \nrespond to the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and \nthat Item 5 could be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant received the FORM, \nincluding a copy of Item 5, but neither responded to the FORM nor otherwise objected \nto Item 5. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 60, is married with one adult stepson. He graduated from high \nschool in 1976. He served honorably in the U.S. Navy from 1980 through 2000. He has \nbeen employed as a flight electrician by the same defense contractor since 2004. He \nwas granted a DOD security clearance in 2008. (Item 4; Item 5 at 2) \n \nThe SOR alleged two delinquent student-loan accounts totaling $82,850. In his \nSOR response, Applicant denied the allegations on the basis that both accounts had \nbeen paid in full. The SOR allegations were corroborated by Applicant\u2019s May 2018 and \nApril 2019 credit reports. The record did not contain any information about how or why \nthe accounts went into default. (Items 1, 2) \n \nApplicant cosigned the two alleged accounts for his stepson to attend college \nwith the intent that his son would be solely responsible for repayment. They were \nprivate loans totaling $49,800. One account number ending in 1037 was opened in \n2005 and the other ending in 1052 was opened in 2007. He was interviewed in \nNovember 2018 by a DOD authorized investigator conducting the background \ninvestigation for his security clearance application. He provided documents to the \ninvestigator showing that the two alleged accounts had been paid in full in 2017.  (Item \n5 at 3, 6, 7; Item 6 at 12; Item 7 at 2) \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant stated that, sometime after the SOR was issued, \nhis son mailed paperwork directly to the DOD CAF to confirm the full payment of the two \nalleged accounts. However, the DOD CAF never received that paperwork and it was not \notherwise included in the record. In the FORM, the Government argued that Applicant \nhad not met his burden to prove that the two alleged accounts had been paid in light of \nthe 2018 and 2019 credit report entries and missing paperwork alleged to have been \nsent to the DOD CAF by his son. (FORM; Items 2, 3) \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant considers his financial situation to be stable. He is willing and able to \npay his expenses. Besides the alleged student-loan accounts, Applicant otherwise lives \nwithin his means and manages his finances responsibly. (5 at 2; Items 6, 7) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Egan at 527 \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a \n\n \n4 \n \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out in \nAG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)  \n \nThe two alleged student-loan accounts, which were corroborated by the credit \nreports, establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability \nto satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the \nfollowing applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant cosigned the two alleged student-loan accounts for his stepson to \nattend college. Both he and his son were responsible for repayment to the creditor. The \n2018 and 2019 credit reports showed the two accounts in delinquent status. It is well \nsettled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the substantial \nevidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations under \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent \nallegations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) and ISCR \nCase No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010). At that point, the burden shifts to \nApplicant to establish either that he is not responsible for the debt or that matters in \nmitigation apply.  \n \n \nApplicant met his burden by providing documents, which were included among \nthe Government\u2019s exhibits, showing that the two alleged accounts had been paid in full \nin 2017, well before the security-clearance process began. He is otherwise managing \nhis finances responsibly. The alleged debts occurred under circumstances not likely to \nrecur and do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated security concerns \nraised by the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, Applicant has carried \nhis burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant was married in 2011 and divorced in 2015. He has no children. He also reported being fired from jobs in February 2017 and July 2017. He remained unemployed until September 2017. The SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $22,581 in delinquent debts. Applicant admitted all but two allegations, and stated in his Answer to the SOR that he was working with a credit repair company on the unresolved debts, and the two debts he denied were resolved and removed from his credit bureau report (CBR). Applicant testified that his debts arose between 2015 and 2017 after he moved to another state to take a job with a car dealer. He ended up in debt after a year because he did not earn enough to live, and was nearly homeless. He moved from job to job and accumulated additional debts. In about November 2018, he hired a credit repair company and paid about $2,000 for their service. He stopped using the company in about December 2019.

Applicant was married in 2011 and divorced \nin 2015. He has no children. He also reported being fired from jobs in February 2017 and \nJuly 2017. He remained unemployed until September 2017. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $22,581 in delinquent debts. \nApplicant admitted all but two allegations, and stated in his Answer to the SOR that he \nwas working with a credit repair company on the unresolved debts, and the two debts he \ndenied were resolved and removed from his credit bureau report (CBR). Applicant \ntestified that his debts arose between 2015 and 2017 after he moved to another state to \ntake a job with a car dealer. He ended up in debt after a year because he did not earn \nenough to live, and was nearly homeless. He moved from job to job and accumulated \nadditional debts. In about November 2018, he hired a credit repair company and paid \nabout $2,000 for their service. He stopped using the company in about December 2019. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a delinquent vehicle lease account that has been charged off for \napproximately $16,659 after the vehicle was voluntarily repossessed. Applicant stated the \naccount became delinquent in about July 2017, while he was unemployed. Appellant\u2019s \ncredit repair company contacted the lender in about November 2019, but they did not \nreport a response. No other action has been taken on the debt, and it remains unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a telephone utility collection account for approximately $1,569. The \naccount was reported in Applicant\u2019s 2018 CBR as delinquent in September 2018. He \ncontacted the creditor in July 2019 and the lender offered to accept a payment of 70% of \nthe debt with the remainder due the following month. Applicant did not have the funds to \npay, and the debt remains unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a $609 collection account for a credit card company. Applicant stated \nin his SCA that he made a critical mistake in judgment when he obtained the credit card. \nHe testified that he spoke to the collection agent and agreed to begin payments of \n$134.96 the day after his hearing in this case, but he had no written plan. In his post-\nhearing submission, Applicant provided a receipt for a pending payment of $470. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a $315 collection for an electric utility account reported delinquent in \nOctober 2018. Applicant\u2019s 2018 CBR shows the account was disputed. Applicant testified \n\n \n3 \n \nthat he has not contacted the creditor, but the account may have been paid. He did not \nsubmit evidence of payment on the account or a reason for disputing it. The collection \naccount remains on his 2019 CBR and the account remains unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a $778 collection account for a veterinary center. Applicant testified \nthat the account was deleted from his CBR because of a clerical error. However, in a \npost-hearing submission, he showed that he actually paid the account in January 16, \n2020, the day of his hearing. The account is now resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a $1,471 collection account for a telephone utility, that Applicant \nclaims belonged to his former spouse. Applicant testified that he disputed the account, \nand it was deleted from his CBR. The account is no longer reported on his CBR. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a $841 medical account from 2016. Applicant claimed that after a car \naccident, his insurance company should have paid the debt. He testified that it is under \nreview, but provided no documentary evidence of a dispute or inquiry filed with the \ninsurance company or medical provider. This account remains unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a $338 credit union debt that is reported as a charged-off debt on his \n2019 CBR. Applicant stated the credit union debt resulted from a bad check from his \nemployer. Applicant testified that he paid the account and it should have been removed \nfrom his CBR. Of note, Applicant\u2019s CBR shows two accounts from the same credit union; \none of which was for an overdrawn account that was paid in 2015. The SOR account was \nreported as a major delinquency (also an overdrawn account) in February 2019. Applicant \ndid not provide documentary evidence of resolution of the SOR account, and it remains \nunresolved. \n \n \nApplicant paid other debts not included in the SOR, and several collection \naccounts were removed from his CBR as a result of work by the credit repair company. \nHe testified that he has about $1,600 in savings, $1,000 in a retirement account, and a \nnet monthly remainder of $500 to $600 per month after paying his monthly debts and \nexpenses. He testified that he has never received professional financial counseling \nexcept for help repairing his credit, but he has a budget and recently purchased a home. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \n\n \n4 \n \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that he claimed date back to 2015 \nto 2017. The debts appear to have resulted from periods of underemployment and a short \nperiod of unemployment as a result of being fired from a job. Applicant has shown some \nefforts to resolve debts by hiring a credit repair company that disputed certain CBR \nentries, and was successful in removing several collection accounts, however the majority \nof the SOR debts remain unresolved. Applicant has not submitted sufficient documentary \nevidence to mitigate SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, b, d, g, and h. Of note, the largest debts, a charged-off \ncar lease and telephone utility, remain unresolved, and several small debts that could \nhave been paid, were not. He has not completed financial counseling and has not shown \nevidence of good financial decisions, or that his financial problems are under control and \nwill not recur. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, e, and f, are mitigated, but the remaining accounts are \nunresolved and there is insufficient evidence of good-faith efforts to resolve them. \n \nApplicant has a history of irresponsible accumulation of debt, and failure to resolve \ndebts when he could. Since September 2017, he has been employed in his current \nposition and should have resolved debts before making other significant purchases. \nAlthough his income appears to be sufficient to meet his current financial obligations with \na substantial net remainder and savings, he does not have a reasonable plan to pay \ndelinquent debts nor has he shown that he will avoid further indebtedness. Overall, \nApplicant\u2019s financial status raises significant doubts about his financial management \ndecisions and personal responsibility. I am not convinced Applicant makes good financial \ndecisions, and his financial status continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. No mitigation conditions fully apply with the \nexception of the resolved debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, e, and f. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and efforts to remove debts with the help of a credit repair \ncompany. However, due to Applicant\u2019s history of failing to address longstanding debts, I \nremain unconvinced of his trustworthiness, financial responsibility, and ability and \nwillingness to meet his financial obligations. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a, b, d, g, and h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.c, e, and f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A.

(Tr. at 15-18, 28-35; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1-3; AE A) \n \n \nThe IRS transferred $2,023 from his 2015 credits for his 2014 taxes.

He stated that he was traveling extensively for work \nand that he was too busy. He reported his failure to file tax returns for 2016 and 2017 on \na Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he submitted in July 2018. \nHe wrote that he failed to file the returns because he was \u201cout of town.\u201d He also wrote: \n\u201cAs for the Federal Tax, at this time, nothing has been done.

He stated that he talked to an IRS \nrepresentative about the taxes owed for 2014, and was told the taxes were considered \nuncollectable by the IRS.

His state issued refunds for tax years \n2016 and 2017. (Tr. at 22, 36-37, 41, 45; GE 2-3; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant lost most of the money that he invested as a day trader. He realizes it \nwas a mistake, and he does not intend to pursue it again. He now has an accountant to \nhandle his taxes and prepare his returns. He paid $6,500 in estimated federal tax \npayments in 2019 for tax year 2019. He paid $3,250 in estimated tax payments to his \nstate in 2019 for tax year 2019. He credibly stated that he has learned a valuable lesson \nfrom this experience and there will no recurrence of his tax problems. (Tr. at 16, 22, 29-\n33, 37-38, 50; AE B-D) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant did not file his 2015 through 2017 federal and state income tax returns \nwhen they were due, and he did not pay his 2014 federal income taxes when they were \ndue. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file his tax returns and pay his taxes when required raises \nquestions about his judgment and willingness to abide by rules and regulations. He filed \nall his returns before the SOR was issued, and he completed his payments to the IRS \nafter the hearing. His returns indicated that he was due refunds for each year, which \nwere applied to his back taxes.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable, but that does not end the discussion. An applicant who \nbegins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being placed on notice that his \nor her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules \nand regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own \ninterests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03187 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2018). I found \nApplicant to be honest and truthful, but unsophisticated about financial matters and lax \nabout his legal requirement to file his tax returns and pay his taxes in a timely manner. I \nam convinced that he has learned a valuable and costly lesson, and that all future \nreturns and taxes will be filed and paid on time. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s \nfinances are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n \n08/26/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n______________ \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The evidence is sufficient to mitigate his history of \nfinancial problems as well as his history of alcohol-related incidents away from work. \nAccordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non January 5, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on May 9, 2019, after reviewing the application and \nthe information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \n\n \n2 \n \nguidelines known as Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline G for alcohol \nconsumption.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 5, 2019. He admitted five of the seven \nfactual allegations under Guideline F; he admitted the five factual allegations under \nGuideline G; he provided a few handwritten explanations; and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  \n  \nThe case was assigned to an administrative judge on August 1, 2019, and then \nreassigned to me on August 9, 2019. The hearing took place as scheduled on \nSeptember 25, 2019. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department Counsel offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-5. Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-K. Other than Applicant, no \nwitnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on October 7, 2019.    \n \nThe record was kept open to provide Applicant an opportunity to submit \nadditional documentation in support of his case. He made a timely submission, and the \ndocuments (along with the e-mail correspondence) are admitted without objections as \nExhibits L-O.      \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance. (Tr. 6-7) He works as a lead flight mechanic performing maintenance on UH-\n60 Black Hawk helicopters. He has been employed with this company or its \npredecessor-in-interest since December 2011. He has a very good employment record \nwith his current employer. (Exhibit M) For example, in a highly favorable letter of \nrecommendation, Applicant\u2019s program manager described Applicant as \u201cone of our best \nand brightest and is routinely sought after when there is a problem with one of our \naircraft.\u201d (Exhibit M at 1) Applicant stated that he has increased his annual income from \n$52,000 in 2011 to about $90,000 in 2019. (Tr. 71) He was previously employed as a \nmaster aircraft mechanic from October 2010 to December 2011. His educational \nbackground includes a high school diploma and some college. \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history also includes honorable service as a traditional, \npart-time Guardsman in the Army National Guard from August 2006 to August 2012. \n(Exhibit H) His military occupational specialty (MOS) was 15T10, helicopter repairer, \nwhich is primarily responsible for maintenance of the Black Hawk helicopter. He was on \nactive duty for about one year, from June 2008 to June 2009. During that period, he \ndeployed to and served in Iraq for about ten months with an aviation unit. His military \ndecorations include the Air Medal (2nd award), Iraq Campaign Medal with Campaign \nStar, and Combat Action Badge.1 \n                                                          \n1 The Air Medal is awarded for single acts of heroism or meritorious achievement while participating in \naerial flight. The Combat Action Badge is awarded to soldiers of the U.S. Army of any rank, and who are \nnot members of an infantry of special forces unit, for being present and actively engaging or being \nengaged by the enemy and performing satisfactorily per the rules of engagement.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant married in 2012. He and his spouse have two young daughters. He has \nlived separately from his spouse for some time, and his intention is to obtain a divorce. \n(Tr. 70-71) He described the current relationship as cordial, they are both focused on \nco-parenting, and he usually has his children on the weekends.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged and Applicant largely admitted a history of financial problems. \nIn addition to his admissions, the factual allegations in the SOR are established by the \ndocumentary evidence. (Exhibits 2, 3, and 5) The SOR concerns seven collection or \ncharged-off accounts ranging in amounts from $439 to $6,704 for a total of \napproximately $18,646. Applicant denies or disputes two of the seven delinquent \naccounts. Pertinent details about the seven debts are discussed below. \n \n \nApplicant attributed the cause of his financial problems to an unexpected \nrecoupment action taken by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) in \n2012 and 2013. (Tr. 33-35; Exhibit J) Per the February 2013 last-chance letter from \nDFAS, the $7,106 debt was due to recoupment of the unearned portion of his National \nGuard bonus. (Exhibit J at 3) Applicant believed the recoupment action took \u201cmore than \ndouble the money\u201d they were supposed to take, which occurred via wage garnishment \nand interception of income tax refunds. (Tr. 33) Applicant tried to contest the action \nwithout success. As a result, Applicant was unable to pay other outstanding debts. (Tr. \n35) Per the 2017 credit report, the DFAS debt is described as a paid $7,100 collection \ndue to government overpayment, and the account is closed. (Exhibit 3 at 3) \n \n \nThe $6,704 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.a stems from a deficiency balance \nafter repossession of an automobile. The 2017 credit report shows that account was an \nautomobile loan for $22,754 with a repayment schedule for 72 months at $429 per \nmonth, which was opened in May 2012. (Exhibit 3 at 3) The credit report also shows the \n$6,704 debt was charged off in August 2013. Applicant explained that he voluntarily \nsurrendered the auto because he was unable to repay the loan due to the then ongoing \nDFAS recoupment action. (Tr. 33-34) He has not taken any action to repay the charged-\noff debt. (Tr. 46-47) \n \n \nThe $4,853 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.b stems from an automobile loan \nApplicant obtained in March 2017. (Exhibits 2 and 3) Applicant explained the \ndelinquency occurred after the vehicle was involved in an accident in January 2018, and \nhe understood his auto insurance company was supposed to settle the matter with \nNissan Motor. (Tr. 35) He has not taken any action to repay the charged-off debt. (Tr. \n48-49)  \n \n \nThe $1,105 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.c stems from a class Applicant sought \nto take with a Christian college or university. He explained that he dropped out of the \nclass after the initial session after he was ridiculed for his religious faith. (Tr. 35, 49-50) \nHe settled the debt for a lesser amount in June 2019. (Exhibit F)  \n \nThe $450 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.d stems from an account with a major \ncredit-card company. Applicant denied this debt because he believes it was erroneously \nestablished when he opened a credit-card account with the same company, an account \n\n \n4 \n \nwhich is in good standing. (Tr. 35-36, 50-51) In other words, the company created two \naccounts at the same time. To that end, Applicant presented three account statements \nfrom August 2019 through October 2019 for a credit-card account with the same major \ncredit-card company showing the account is in good standing. (Exhibit N) Applicant also \npresented a single page from a credit report that reflects both accounts. (Exhibit O) The \naccount in good standing was opened in January 2018, and the account status is \ndescribed as open/never late. The account at issue in the SOR was opened in \nDecember 2017, the balance was $450 as of May 2019, the account status was \ncharged off with $450 past due as of May 2019, and the account was closed at the \ncreditor\u2019s request. Applicant is mistaken in his belief; namely, the closure of a delinquent \naccount does not equate to a favorable resolution. The debt is a legitimate charged-off \naccount as reflected in the April 2019 credit report. (Exhibit 2 at 2)  \n \n \nThe $439 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.e stems from a cable TV bill. (Tr. 36, 51-\n52) Applicant paid the account in full in June 2019. (Exhibit E)  \n \n \nThe $4,480 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.f stems from an apartment lease \nApplicant signed in September/October 2010 in his state of former residence. (Tr. 36-\n37, 53-54; Exhibit K) Applicant disputes the validity of this debt. He explained in vivid \ndetail that after he signed the lease, he inspected the apartment and discovered holes \nin the wall, blood on the floor, and all the appliances were missing. (Tr. 36) He deemed \nthe apartment unfit for occupancy, and the landlord attempted to have him sign another \nlease for a different apartment. He refused, but did move his household goods into the \nsecond apartment where it remained for a few weeks until his departure. The charged-\noff account is reflected in the 2017 credit report but is not reflected in the 2019 credit \nreport. (Exhibits 2 and 3) Given the age of the account, it probably aged off the 2019 \ncredit report.  \n \n \nThe $615 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.g stems from a telephone account. \nApplicant settled the debt for $472 in June 2019. (Exhibit G)   \n \n \nIn addition to the matters in the SOR, Applicant presented proof of payment of a \n$25 medical collection account stemming from an emergency room visit. (Exhibit I) \n \n \nOverall, Applicant stated that his financial situation was improving. He had \n$2,000 in a savings account, $2,000 at home as an emergency fund, and he was no \nlonger living paycheck-to-paycheck. (Tr. 72)  \n \n \nApplicant has a history of excessive consumption of alcohol, beer in his case. He \nattributes his heavy drinking to the culture he experienced during his military service. \n(Tr. 64-65) It may have included drinking to the point where he had blackouts. (Tr. 59) \nHe stated that after returning from his deployment to Iraq in 2009, he \u201ckind of crawled \ninto a bottle and it took a while for [him] to work [himself] out of it.\u201d (Tr. 59) He further \nexplained that he believes he was a functioning alcoholic for most of the time he was \nliving and working in State T from October 2010 to December 2011. (Tr. 59, 70; Exhibit \n1) He believes that he used to have an alcohol problem, but that he has essentially \ngrown out of it. (Tr. 63) He currently drinks a six-pack of beer over the course of a \n\n \n5 \n \nweekend, and he does not drink at all during the work week. (Tr. 64-65) The change \ncame about when he moved from State T to State A, and he began his current job in \nDecember 2011 (Tr. 65) His subsequent marriage in 2012 and the birth of his first child \nin 2012 were also motivating factors. He has not sought out treatment or counseling for \nhis use of alcohol other than what he went through after he was charged with driving \nunder the influence (DUI) in January 2018, as discussed below. (Tr. 63, 69-70)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged and Applicant admitted a police record of five alcohol-related \nincidents away from work. Four of the incidents occurred during 2010-2012. The most \nrecent incident was a DUI arrest following a single-car accident in January 2018. He has \nnever had an alcohol-related incident at work. In addition to his admissions, the factual \nallegations in the SOR are established by the documentary evidence. (Exhibits 1, 4, 5, \nA, and B) Pertinent details about the five incidents are discussed below. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in \nOctober 2010 while living in State T. The FBI Identification Record reflects that \nApplicant pleaded no contest and the charge was dismissed. (Exhibit 4) Applicant \nexplained that he was stopped by the police after leaving a sports bar where he had \ndrunk beer. (Tr. 37-38) He also explained that the charge was dismissed under a \nprogram for returning military veterans with combat experience. The DWI charge was \ndismissed when he showed proof of his Combat Action Badge.  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for and charged with public intoxication in November \n2010 while living in State T. The FBI record reflects that Applicant was charged with \nunlawful carrying a weapon, the disposition of which was a no bill. (Exhibit 4) Applicant \nexplained that he was stopped by the police while walking to a store. (Tr. 38-39, 57-60) \nHe may have declined to perform a field sobriety test, but he told the police he was \ncarrying a firearm, which he then assisted them in locating on his person. He went to \nthe scheduled court appearance intending to contest the public intoxication offense, but \ndecided to plead guilty and pay a $100 fine so he could avoid waiting and get back to \nwork. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for and charged with DWI in September 2011 while living \nin State T. The FBI record reflects that the charge was dismissed. (Exhibit 4) Applicant \nexplained that he believes he was charged because he refused to perform a \nbreathalyzer test. (Tr. 39-40, 60-61) He stated he had previously taken and passed the \nfield sobriety tests. He had not consumed alcohol that night, as he was the designated \ndriver.  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication in March 2012, a few \nmonths after relocating to State A. Applicant explained this incident stemmed from his \nattempt to buy a piece of furniture via Craigslist and the resulting misunderstanding and \nconflict between him and the seller. (Tr. 40-41, 61-62; Exhibit 5 at 4) Applicant had one \nor two beers at a sports bar before meeting with the seller. The seller called the police, \nand Applicant ended up arrested for public intoxication. He sought legal advice because \nhe was soon to be married and wanted to dispose of the matter. Per his lawyer\u2019s advice, \nhe pleaded no contest and paid a small fine.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe fifth and most recent incident occurred in January 2018, when he was \narrested for and charged with DUI. Applicant explained this incident stemmed from a \nsingle-car accident while driving home after a poker game at a friend\u2019s house where he \nhad a couple of beers. (Tr. 41-42, 63, 74-75). He stopped on the way and bought a 12-\npack of beer. Resuming his trip, he hit a deer about three miles from his home, entered \nthe ditch next to the road, and then hit a tree. He broke a rib, fractured his leg, and was \nlaying alongside the road when the authorities arrived. The 12-pack of beer had \nexploded during the accident. The police wanted him to perform a field sobriety test, \nwhich he refused due to his injuries. He was subsequently arrested.  \n \nIn February 2018, the State Driver License Division concluded the available \ninformation about the incident was not sufficient for an administrative suspension, and \ndecided not to administratively suspend his driving privilege based on his refusal. \n(Exhibit B) For the DUI case, with assistance of counsel, Applicant completed a type of \npre-trial diversion program over the course of several months requiring him to submit to \nrandom drug and alcohol tests and attend classes on substance abuse. The major \nlesson he learned from the program was that \u201cit\u2019s just easier to not live life on that side.\u201d \n(Tr. 74-75) Applicant complied with all requirements, including payment of $370 in court \ncosts, and the state court dismissed the DUI charge in November 2018. (Exhibit A)  \n \n \nAt the time of the accident, Applicant had already reduced his level of alcohol \nconsumption. After the accident, Applicant abstained from alcohol during the months he \nwas in the program, from about March through October 2018. (Tr. 73) He then resumed \ndrinking beer, but only on weekends as described above.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.2 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d3 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.4 The DOHA Appeal \n                                                          \n2 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 484 U.S. at 531. \n\n \n7 \n \nBoard has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed \nunder the substantial-evidence standard.5 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.7 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \n                                                          \n5 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n7 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are related to \nthe unexpected DFAS action to recoup a bonus he received for his service in the \nNational Guard. The recoupment action was for $7,100, which is not a minor sum of \nmoney. The recoupment action was in late 2012 and early 2013, it followed his marriage \nand the birth of his first child in 2012, and it proved to be a financial setback. He acted \nreasonably under the circumstances by voluntarily surrendering a vehicle he could no \nlonger afford. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.    \n \n \nApplicant has made a good-faith effort to resolve some of his delinquent \naccounts. He paid or settled three of the smaller debts and he paid a minor medical \ncollection account too. But there are also three accounts for which he has taken no \naction and had no plan to do so. One of those three he was under the mistaken \nimpression that the account is invalid. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition \nat AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor to a limited extent.  \n \n \nApplicant has also provided sufficient evidence, through his vivid testimony and \ndocumentation, that he has a legitimate basis to dispute the $4,480 collection account \nstemming from the apartment lease he signed in 2010. He probably has a legitimate \nclaim of constructive eviction, in that the landlord\u2019s act of making the apartment unfit for \noccupancy resulted in Applicant being compelled to leave. In any event, the debt is \nnearly ten years old, and it is no longer reflected in the Government\u2019s most recent credit \nreport from 2019. Given all the circumstances, it is no longer of security significance. \nAccordingly, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to this particular debt.  \n \n \nUnder Guideline G for alcohol consumption, the suitability of an applicant may be \nquestioned or put into doubt because, as set forth in AG \u00b6 21, excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and it can raise questions about a person\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of excessive \nconsumption of alcohol that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline G. \nFor the reasons discussed below, the disqualifying and mitigating conditions noted \nabove apply here.  \n \n \nThe key facts are not in dispute. Applicant was involved in five incidents, as \nalleged in the SOR, which resulted in a police record. He admits that he consumed \nalcohol in four of the five incidents. The incidents cover a period of years; the first four \noccurred during a period of less than two years from October 2010 to March 2012. The \nfifth and most recent occurred in January 2018, about 18 months before the record \nclosed in this case. The three incidents resulting in DWI or DUI charges ended in \ndismissal, while he pleaded guilty or no contest to two charges of public intoxication and \npaid a small fine for each offense.  \n \n \nApplicant reports that he has reduced and modified his beer drinking. He limits \nhimself to a six-pack on the weekends and does not drink during the work week. He has \nfollowed that pattern of consumption since his relocation to State A in December 2011. \nHe abstained from alcohol for a period of several months following the January 2018 \nincident. He did so as part of the pre-trial diversion program, which he successfully \ncompleted and had the DUI charge dismissed in November 2018.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service also deserves consideration. The award of \nthe Air Medal on two occasions and the Combat Action Badge for his service in Iraq are \nsignificant matters. A bit of leeway or forgiveness or both is appropriate for a soldier \nwho risked his life for our Nation, and I have credited him accordingly.       \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant impressed me as a no-nonsense person. He was \ncandid and direct with answers in response to questions. He made admissions (e.g., \ncrawled into a bottle and functioning alcoholic) about his history of alcohol consumption \n\n \n10 \n \nthat demonstrated self-awareness, insight, and self-reflection about his use of alcohol. It \nwas also an acknowledgment of his abuse of alcohol.  \n \n \nFinally, I considered the history of Applicant\u2019s financial problems and alcohol-\nrelated incidents together. A good part of his problems, but not the entirety, took place \nyears ago. His financial position is much improved and he is earning enough income to \nprovide for his family and pay his creditors. His pattern of alcohol consumption has also \nmuch improved, as he reduced and modified his beer drinking to a point where it is not \nexcessive. Overall, I am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems and \nalcohol-related incidents are now safely in the past and will not recur in the future. \nAccordingly, given the totality of facts and circumstances, I conclude that Applicant is an \nacceptable security risk within the meaning of \u00b6 2(a) of Appendix A to the Directive. \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for a public trust position is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on August 23, 2018, seeking eligibility for a public trust position. On June 10, 2019, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR), citing \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F. DOD acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 25, 2019, admitted the two allegations, \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was \nready to proceed on August 1, 2019, and the case was assigned to me on January 9, \n2020. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a notice of hearing \non January 14, 2020, scheduling the hearing for February 4, 2020. I convened the \n\n2 \n \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nI, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nFebruary 13, 2020. \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file her federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016. At the end of the hearing, I granted \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion to amend the SOR to allege that she failed to timely file \nfederal and state income tax returns for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. I kept the record \nopen until February 19, 2020, to enable Applicant to respond to the amendment. She \ntimely submitted AX J, which was admitted without objection. Department Counsel \nsubmitted comments concerning AX J, which are included in the record as GX 5. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old site manager employed by a defense contractor since \nJanuary 2014. She served on active duty in the U.S. Army from January 1992 to \nSeptember 1994 and received an honorable discharge. She has worked for defense \ncontractors since March 2004. She received eligibility for a public trust position in \nNovember 2010. \n \nApplicant married in August 1994 and has two daughters, ages 19 and 23. Her \nolder daughter is in college and lives away from home, and her younger daughter lives \nwith her. (Tr. 31.)  \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 1996, and she is currently enrolled \nin graduate school, working toward a master\u2019s degree in information systems \nmanagement. (Tr. 32.) She also completed training as a massage therapist in 2011 and \nincurred significant student loans for her training, but she has never earned any income \nas a massage therapist. (Tr. 33, 45.) Credit reports from September 2018 and June \n2019 reflected six delinquent student loans totaling $21,247. Three of the past-due \nloans totaling $8,747 were reflected as paid collections, having been paid in December \n2016. The remaining student loans were reflected as assigned to the government. (GX \n2 at 3-4; GX 3 at 5-6.) She increased her income tax liability by filing separately so that \nher husband\u2019s tax refunds would not be seized to pay her delinquent student loans. (Tr. \n61-62.) In 2014, she received a pay raise from $75,000 per year to $95,000, but she did \nnot increase the amount of tax withholding until 2015. The combination of her pay raise \nand the decision to file separately increased the amount of taxes due. She testified that \ndid not timely file her federal and state income tax return for 2014 because she knew \nshe owed income taxes for that year. (Tr. 36-38.)  \n \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in September 2018, \nshe told the investigator that she did not file her returns for 2014, 2015, and 2016 \nbecause she could not afford to pay the taxes due. She also told the investigator that \nshe thought she had a three-year grace period to file her returns. (GX 4 at 1.) In her \n\n3 \n \nresponse to the SOR, she stated that she was advised about the three-year grace \nperiod by a \u201ctax professional.\u201d At the hearing, she did not repeat her claim of relying on \na three-year grace period. When asked who told her about a three-year grace period, \nshe responded that she did not remember who it was. (Tr. 62.) \n \n \nApplicant did not rely on a three-year grace period. She had not filed the past-\ndue returns when she answered the SOR in June 2019. She filed her 2014 federal and \nstate income tax returns in August 2019, after she received the SOR, and she filed her \n2015 returns in September 2019. As of the date of the hearing, she had not filed her \nreturns for 2016 and 2017. (Tr. 40, 42-43; AX B with note attached.) She testified that \nshe did not have a reason for not having filed her 2016 returns, except that she was \n\u201cpreparing them [herself] and just fine-tuning \u2013 you know, refining it and making sure \nthat everything was correct.\u201d (Tr. 41.) She offered the same explanation for not filing her \n2017 returns. (Tr. 43.) She timely filed her federal income tax return for 2018 and \nreceived a refund. (Tr. 44.)  \n \n \nAfter Applicant filed her federal returns for 2014 and 2015, she received a bill \nfrom the IRS. She made an installment agreement with the IRS to pay the taxes due for \n2014 and 2015, totaling about $20,610. The agreement provides for monthly $292 \npayments. She made the first monthly payment on December 13, 2019. (AX E at 2; Tr. \n27-28.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current annual salary is about $101,000. Her husband is a police \nofficer and earns about $64,000 per year. (Tr. 48.) She has worked for her current \nemployer for about 15 years. She provided no evidence of the quality of her \nperformance, but her substantial pay raise in 2014 indicates high-quality performance. \nHer February 2020 credit report reflects that she has resolved the delinquent student \nloans that made her unable to pay her taxes. (AX I.)   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nSEAD 4, \u00b6 E.4. A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. An \n\n4 \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of national security. The Government must \npresent substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by \nsubstantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate \nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or \ncontinue eligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR as amended alleges that Applicant failed to timely file federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The past-due federal \nreturns are alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and past-due state returns are alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nShe admitted both allegations in her answer to the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely pay the taxes due is not alleged. Conduct not alleged \nin the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a \nparticular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered the evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax debts for these limited purposes. \n \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible \nmay also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding \n\n5 \n \nclassified or sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s failures to timely file federal and state \nincome tax returns were recent, frequent, and did not occur under circumstances \nmaking recurrent unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were largely due to \nher financial mismanagement, and they did not prevent her from timely filing her returns \nor requesting extensions of time to file. She did not begin to file her past-due tax returns \nuntil tax year 2018, when she was entitled to a refund of federal taxes.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant claimed that she was advised by a \u201ctax \nprofessional\u201d that she had three years to file her tax returns without penalty, but she \nwas unable to identify that person at the hearing. She submitted no documentary \nevidence of financial or tax advice. Furthermore, her tax problems are not yet under \n\n6 \n \ncontrol, because she had not yet filed her federal tax returns for 2016 and 2017 as of \nthe date of the hearing. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established for 2014 and 2015, for which she has filed her returns \nand is making payments pursuant to a payment agreement with the IRS. It is not \nestablished for 2016 and 2017, for which she had not filed her returns as of the date the \nrecord closed.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s eventual compliance with her tax obligations for 2014 and 2015 does \nnot end the inquiry. A public trust adjudication is not a tax-enforcement procedure. It is \nan evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The fact that \nApplicant has filed some of her past-due returns \u201cdoes not preclude careful \nconsideration of her trustworthiness based on longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). She did not begin \nfiling her past-due returns until she received the SOR. An applicant who begins to \naddress trustworthiness concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her \neligibility for a public trust position is in jeopardy may lack the willingness to follow rules \nand regulations when his or her personal interests are not at stake. ADP Case No. 15-\n03696 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2019).

Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961) \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \npublic trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and I have applied the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns \n\n7 \n \nbased on her repeated failure to timely file her federal and state income tax returns. \nAccordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to continue her eligibility for a public trust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position.

National security eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 30, 2018, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86). On June 7, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG), effective on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on June 27, 2019, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. On September 16, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On September 24, 2019, DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing setting the case for November 13, 2019. The case was heard \nas scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 into \nevidence. Applicant testified. He offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C. All exhibits \nwere admitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 22, 2019. The \nrecord remained open until December 6, 2019, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit \nadditional exhibits. No other exhibits were submitted. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nPrior to the commencement of this case, Department Counsel withdrew Paragraph \n1.d in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied the remaining eleven debts alleged in the SOR. He asserted none \nof the debts were his, but were the result of his former wife\u2019s forging his signature on \ncredit card applications and student loans documents for his stepdaughter. \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old. He was married to his first wife from 2001 to 2015. During \nthat time, he adopted her two daughters who were in their teens. He married his second \nwife three months ago. (Tr. 25-27, 40) He attended college, but did not earn a degree. He \nused student loans for his education and paid them. (Tr. 30) \n \n \nApplicant has been working for a federal contractor since April 2017. For three \nyears prior to obtaining his position, he worked as a truck driver. He worked for a federal \ncontractor from 2005 to 2010, during which time he deployed overseas for periods of time. \nHe also worked for federal contractors from October 2013 to May 2014. He has held a \nsecurity clearance while employed by federal contractors. (Tr. 28; GE 1)  \n \n \nIn February 2015, while separated from his first wife, Applicant emailed her about \ndelinquent debts on his credit report that he asserted were not his and wanted her to \nresolve. He specifically mentioned 16 credit accounts that totaled $6,474, and student \nloans that totaled $70,438. In response, she asked him to give her a list of the credit card \ndebts that he believed to be her responsibility. She stated that the only student loans in \nhis name were related to one daughter\u2019s Parent Plus Loans, which she said would be \npaid by their daughter. (AE C) Applicant said he subsequently discussed the debts with \nhis former wife, but never provided a written response to her with the account names and \nnumbers. (Tr. 69) Their marital settlement agreement did not address the distribution of \ntheir debts. (Tr. 77) \n \n \n \nIn March 2015, Applicant and his first wife were divorced. In September 2015, he \nfiled a police report, over the telephone, alleging that his former wife had opened credit \ncards in his name that he had not authorized. He told the police that some credit cards \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nhad been in default since 2007. He could not supply the account numbers of the cards \nbecause he did not have them. He did not mention the outstanding student loans alleged \nin this case. (Tr. 45, 52-53; Answer)  \n \n \nApplicant stated that prior to contacting the police in September 2015, he sent 10 \nto 12 handwritten letters to various creditors, including the Department of Education \n(DOE), inquiring about the delinquent accounts and loans, and claiming that he was not \nresponsible for the debts. He said every creditor replied to his inquiry and asserted that \nhe was responsible for the debts. (Tr. 55-56) \n \n \nIn his 2018 SF 86, Applicant disclosed delinquent debts that were listed in his \nname, and again asserted they were accounts opened by his former wife without his \nconsent or authorization. He noted that he requested copies of the signature page \nopening the accounts from the creditors, but never received them. He indicated that he \nnever signed for any purchase on the accounts. He said he filed a report with the local \npolice department but never received updates on his report. He also stated that he called \nvarious law enforcement agencies, but did not receive assistance in resolving this issue. \n(GE 1)  \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR), dated November 2019, April 2019, and \nAugust 2018, the June 7, 2019 SOR alleged 11 debts. Five of them were delinquent \nstudent loans that totaled $89,655. They were opened between 2011 and 2013 and \nbecame delinquent between 2015 and 2018. Six debts were retail or consumer accounts \nand totaled $6,220. They were opened between 2009 and 2011 and became delinquent \nbetween 2014 and 2018. (GE 2, 3, 5) \n \nAccording to GE 4, in July 2011 Applicant executed a promissory note as a parent \nand agreed to be financially responsible for his daughter\u2019s student loans. GE 4 lists \nApplicant\u2019s typewritten name as a guarantor, but the exhibit does not contain the \nsignature page to the promissory note, which Applicant asserted his former wife forged. \nApplicant denied that he signed that agreement and stated that he would not have done \nso because he had a strained relationship with his daughter. The last time he spoke to \nher was when he separated from his former spouse in 2014. Although Applicant disputed \nthe student loans with the DOE, it informed him that he was financially responsible. For \nthe past two years, DOE has intercepted his Federal tax refunds, which have totaled \nbetween $3,000 and $4,000. He assumed that DOE will continue to do that until the \nstudent loan debt is paid. (Tr. 64-67)  \n \n \nAfter receiving the SOR in June 2019, Applicant contacted an attorney about the \nforgery and delinquent debts. The attorney was unable to help him. (Tr. 59) In October \n2019, he filed an amendment to his September 2015 police report, in which he included \nthe name of the student loan lender and the account number. (Tr. 59-60; AE A) In \nNovember 2019, he filed an identity theft report with the Federal Trade Commission \n(FTC). He listed two fraudulent accounts: one credit card account for $484, and \neducational loans for $70,436. He stated in the report that he learned of the fraud in \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nSeptember 2015. He said he did not know that he could file an identity theft claim on-line \nwith the FTC. (Tr. 62; AE B) \n \n \nAll of the allegations in the SOR remain unresolved, except one. In October 2019, \nApplicant paid the $1,131 judgement alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. (GE 5 at 1) He acknowledged \nthat he had an account with the jewelry store alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, but claimed he paid \nthe $1,239 debt. He did not provide proof that it was resolved. The debt was charged-off \nin October 2019. He continued to assert that his former wife is responsible for the unpaid \ndebts because she fraudulently opened the accounts without his consent. (Tr. 73-74; GE \n5) \n \n \nApplicant stated that his former wife handled their finances while he was away, \nsometimes six months out of a year. (Tr. 43) Applicant earns about $85,000 annually. His \nwife earns about $58,000 annually. (Tr. 33-34) He estimated that he has about $2,300 \nremaining each month after paying some expenses. (Tr. 38) He did not submit a written \nbudget or proof of credit or financial counseling. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of not resolving financial obligations that he became aware \nof in 2014 and are listed in his 2018 and 2019 credit reports. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out five conditions that could potentially mitigate those \nfinancial security concerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issues. \nIn 2014, Applicant became aware of delinquent debts and student loans that \ncreditors determined to be his financial obligation after his inquiry. None of those debts \nare resolved. The evidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant did \nnot provide sufficient documentation to prove that the debt problems were beyond his \ncontrol. Although there is evidence that his former wife indicated that their daughter would \nrepay her school loans, she did not, and the DOE determined that he is responsible in the \nevent she did not pay. Subsequently, it intercepted two of his federal tax refunds. There \nis insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nApplicant has not participated in credit or financial counseling, and there is \ninsufficient evidence to find that the SOR allegations are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does \nnot apply. He paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, showing a good-faith effort to resolve it. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) applies to that debt, but not to the other ten delinquencies. \n \nIn 2014, Applicant wrote creditors listed on his credit report and disputed the \nreported debts on the basis that he never authorized his wife to open the accounts. He \nalso wrote DOE, disputing his responsibility for the delinquent student loans. He stated \nthat all creditors replied and stated that that he was responsible. While he may have a \nvalid basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debts, he did not present documented \nproof of his assertions or sufficient evidence of the actions he has taken to resolve the \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nmatters. He filed a police report in September 2015, in which he alleged his wife\u2019s forgery, \nbut did not provide the police with the necessary details to investigate the complaint \nfurther. In October 2019, five years later, he filed an amended police report and listed one \nretail debt and the specific student loans that he was disputing. The evidence does not \nestablish sufficient mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(e).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 49 years old and has held a security clearance at times during the \nyears when he was employed by federal contractors. In 2014, he learned that his credit \nreport contained delinquent consumer debts and student loans, which he claimed were \nnot his responsibility and had been opened by his former wife without his authorization. \nAbout a month prior to his divorce in March 2015, he raised the issue with her, and she \nrequested details of the accounts in question. He said he spoke to her about the accounts, \nbut never detailed them in writing. Later in 2015, he wrote to the creditors about the issue \nand they responded, telling him he was responsible. In September 2015, he filed a police \nreport that lacked specific details about the alleged fraudulent debts. After that, he took \nminimal actions to resolve the delinquent debts. After receiving the June 2019 SOR, he \ninitiated some additional efforts. \n \nThe record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under the Financial Considerations guideline.  \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \n    \nAgainst Applicant \n                  Subparagraph 1.d: \n \n \n \n        Withdrawn \n       Subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f:  \n \n        Against Applicant \n                  Subparagraph 1.g: \n \n \n \n        For Applicant \n       Subparagraphs 1.h through 1.l: \n \n        Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on August 15, 2016. \nOn November 26, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 4, 2020, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case \non April 3, 2020. On April 6, 2020, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), \nwhich included Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4, was sent to Applicant, who was \ngiven an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate \nthe Government\u2019s evidence. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \n\n \n2\ntransmittal letter is dated April 6, 2020, and Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated April 22, 2020. \nThe DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she had 30 days after receiving it to \nsubmit information. She did not file a response. The DOHA transmittal letter and receipt \nare appended to the record as Administrative Exhibit (Admin. Ex.) 1. The case was \nassigned to me on July 2, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her Federal \ntax returns for tax years 2012 through 2018. Applicant admits this allegation. Applicant \ndisclosed her failure to timely file her tax returns on her e-QIP and discussed it during her \npersonal subject interview (PSI) and in her responses to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories. (GX 3; \nGX 4.) Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 62, is a financial analyst working for a defense contractor since 1987. \nShe graduated from a vocational technical college in 1980. She married and divorced \ntwice and has three adult children. She was first granted a security clearance in 2006. \n(GX 3.)  \n \nApplicant was diagnosed with a serious medical condition in 2010. As a result, she \nwas out of work on medical leave for eight months during which time she received short-\nterm disability payments that were less than her regular pay. She incurred significant \nmedical debt during this period and has suffered subsequent medical issues where she \nincurred additional medical debts. She attributes her financial difficulties to her health \nissues, the related medical debts, and expensive monthly prescription costs. She stated \nduring her PSI that she was concerned that she would be unable to afford to pay any \ntaxes she owed and did not timely file her Federal tax return for 2010. (GX 4.) On her e-\nQIP, Applicant also listed the first year she failed to timely file as 2010. In her responses \nto DOHA\u2019s interrogatories, she stated that she is \u201cuncertain\u201d as to whether or not she filed \nher returns for 2011, 2012, and 2013. After the first year of failing to timely file, the problem \n\u201csnowballed\u201d and she did not timely file her Federal tax returns through tax year 2018. \n(GX 2; GX 3; GX 4.) Applicant lives in a state where there is no state income tax. \n  \nOn her August 2016 e-QIP, Applicant estimated that she owed $3,000 for 2012 \nand also for 2013, and $4,000 for 2014 and also for 2015. She stated that she \u201cmust take \nimmediate action and contact the IRS for a plan of action.\u201d During her November 2018 \nPSI, she confirmed the amounts listed on her e-QIP and estimated that she owed $5,000 \nfor 2016 and also for 2017. She stated that she knew she needed to contact the IRS but \nwas afraid to do so, stating that it could \u201ctake the rest of her life\u201d to pay off her tax debts \nand described her overall financial situation as \u201cstressed.\u201d However, she asserted her \nintention to contact the IRS to establish a repayment plan before the end of 2018.  \n \nIn her July 20, 2019 responses to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories, Applicant stated that \nshe filed her 2018 Federal tax return on July 19, 2019, and that she owed $4,640 for tax \nyear 2018. She further stated that she was sending an $800 payment towards the 2018 \ntaxes owed. Additionally, she stated that she would make monthly payments to the IRS \n\n \n3\nto satisfy all her delinquent taxes, but had not yet contacted the IRS to make payment \narrangements. Applicant did not provide any documentation supporting her assertions \nthat she filed her 2018 Federal tax return or that she paid $800 towards her 2018 tax debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a has not been resolved. There is no evidence that Applicant has participated in \nany financial counseling. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n\n \n4\nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n \n \nThe record establishes the following disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal . . . income tax returns or failure \nto pay annual Federal . . . income tax as required. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n \n5\ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are recent, ongoing, and unresolved. Applicant\u2019s failure \nto timely file her Federal tax returns as required from at least tax year 2012 through 2018 \nmay have been due, in part, to circumstances beyond her control. Specifically, she \nsuffered from a serious medical condition in 2010 that resulted in a sustained period of \nreduced income and significant medical debt. She initially did not timely file her return \nbecause she was unable to pay the taxes she owed. She did not file the subsequent years \nthrough 2018 because she did not have the money and because she was afraid. Since \n2010, she has experienced other medical issues that resulted in additional medical debts, \nand her monthly prescription costs are high.  \n \nDespite her unexpected medical issues and their impact on her overall finances to \ninclude her ability to pay her taxes, Applicant did not act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant was given notice that the Government was concerned about \nher unfiled Federal tax returns, first when she completed her e-QIP in August 2016, again \nwhen she answered questions about the unfiled returns during her November 2018 PSI, \nand yet again when she received and responded to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories in July 2019. \nAlthough she asserts that she filed her 2018 tax return and made an $800 payment to the \nIRS the day before she submitted her interrogatory responses, she did not provide any \ndocumentary evidence to support this assertion. However, even if she did take these \nactions, it is simply too little too late. She has not contacted the IRS to establish a \nrepayment plan.   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file her Federal tax returns for at least seven \nconsecutive years, while aware that the Government was concerned about this conduct \nsince at least 2016, raises concerns about her willingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, and about her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. She has not \nparticipated in any financial counseling. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\n\n \n6\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).  \n \n \n \nI have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) and incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. While the SOR does not allege that Applicant \nowes a significant amount in delinquent Federal taxes, I have considered this in my whole-\nperson analysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her failure to comply with \nFederal tax filing requirements. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

He is currently \non probation for the last offense, and stopped drinking only one month before the record \nclosed. Based on a review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, national security \neligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on July 1, 2014. (Government Exhibit 1.) On June 26, 2019, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nConsumption). An \u201cAmendment to the Statement of Reasons\u201d (Amendment) was \nsubmitted to Applicant by Department Counsel in this case on September 30, 2019. The \nactions were taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the \nDepartment of Defense after June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the initial SOR in writing (Answer) with attachments on August \n6, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. He answered the \nAmendment on October 7, 2019. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nSeptember 30, 2019. The case was assigned to me on October 4, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on October 4, 2019. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled on November 7, 2019. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 9, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits A and B (originally attached \nto his Answer), which were also admitted without objection. Applicant requested that the \nrecord remain open for the receipt of additional documentation. No additional information \nwas submitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 19, 2019.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 55, and widowed. He does not have any children. Applicant has a \nBachelor of Science degree and is employed by a defense contractor as a software \nengineer. He is seeking to retain a national security eligibility in connection with his work \nwith the DoD.  \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he uses intoxicants to excess. Applicant admitted allegations 1.a through 1.d in \nthe SOR under this guideline, with explanations. He denied allegation 1.e. Allegations 1.a \nthrough 1.d will be discussed in chronological order: \n \n \n1.d. Applicant was first arrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) on June 29, \n1987. He was 23 at that time. Applicant pled guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced \nto three years of probation, a fine, to serve a suspended jail sentence, and was ordered \nto attend a first conviction program. Applicant was fulfilling the requirements of his \nsentence when he was arrested for DUI a second time, as set forth below. (Government \nExhibits 8 and 9; Tr. 44-45.)  \n \n \n1.c. Applicant was arrested for a DUI on December 12, 1988. He pled guilty to DUI \nwith a prior conviction. His sentence included five years of probation, his driver\u2019s license \nwas restricted for one year, a fine and jail time. Applicant successfully completed all the \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nterms of this sentence. His probation ended in approximately March 1994. Applicant did \nnot drink during his time on probation. (Government Exhibits 7 and 9; Tr. 40, 45-47.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant was arrested a third time for DUI in August 1995. He plead guilty to \nDUI. His sentence included seven years of probation, a fine, community service, his \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for eighteen months, and he had to attend an eighteen-\nmonth alcohol awareness class. Applicant successfully completed all of the requirements. \n(Government Exhibits 6 and 9; Tr. 47.)  \n \n \nApplicant met his wife in 1998. They were together until her death on July 8, 2017. \nDuring that time Applicant continued to drink alcohol, but he stated his use was primarily \nrestricted to home and sporting events with friends. Applicant\u2019s alcohol use increased \nafter her death, as he would drink when he got home to help him sleep. His alcohol use \ncontinued at sporting events. He also had a heart attack a short time after his wife died. \nAfter about a year Applicant decided he needed to get out and socialize. This resulted in \nhis fourth DUI arrest, described below. (Tr. 30-31, 47-50.) \n \n \n1.a. Applicant was arrested for DUI on August 19, 2018. Applicant had been out at \nan event and had too much to drink. On the way home he decided to park his truck and \nsleep it off, but left his engine running. Police woke him up and arrested him after receiving \na report from a concerned citizen. According to court records, Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol \nlevel was 0.14%. He plea guilty and was sentenced to five years of summary probation, \nand fined. He was also required to attend a first conviction program that included several \ntypes of counseling, and a Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD) program. Applicant \nremains on probation until 2023, but has completed the rest of the sentencing \nrequirements. Applicant stated that he will never drink and drive again. (Government \nExhibits 3 and 5; Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 19-29, 51-60, 64, 67.)   \n \n \n1.e. Applicant has been a habitual alcohol user for many years, starting in \napproximately 1982. Applicant continued to drink after his most recent arrest, primarily on \nsocial occasions, occasionally to excess and intoxication. He testified that he last used \nalcohol when he drank approximately five glasses of whiskey at a football game about a \nmonth before the hearing in this case. Applicant\u2019s testimony about his future use of \nalcohol was unclear. He appeared to state that he had stopped drinking completely. Yet, \nApplicant also testified, \u201cI hope that I\u2019m trending towards not drinking, but I\u2019m not there \nyet.\u201d He also stated that his goal was to stop drinking irresponsibly. He is not currently \nattending any alcohol treatment, including Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). (Government \nExhibit 3; Tr. 37-39, 43-44, 60-62.)  \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J: Criminal Conduct) \n \n \n \n2.a. The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nnational security eligibility because he will remain on probation until approximately \nOctober 2023 as a result of the conviction set forth under allegation 1.a. Applicant \nadmitted this allegation. \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant has had a successful career, as shown by his resume. (Applicant Exhibit \nB.)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven disqualifying conditions that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions possibly apply to the facts \nin this case: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \nApplicant has a long history of drinking to excess, as shown by the four alcohol-\nrelated incidents set forth in the SOR and discussed above. The last incident was in \nAugust 2018, one year before the record closed in this case. Applicant stated he last \ndrank alcohol about a month before the record closed. He is on probation until 2023. Both \nof the cited conditions apply.   \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate alcohol \nconsumption security concerns:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or \njudgment; \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions were established in this case. Applicant had four \nalcohol-related arrests, the last in August 2018. As stated, Applicant will be on probation \nuntil 2023, and continued to drink until one month before his hearing. He appears to have \nmade recent strides towards sobriety, but his problem is of long duration, and he has not \nparticipated in any formal alcohol counseling or treatment programs. Considering all the \navailable evidence, I find that not enough time has passed without an incident to establish \nconfidence that he will not resume drinking and acting irresponsibly while under the \ninfluence. The Alcohol Consumption guideline is found against Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J: Criminal Conduct) \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. One condition was alleged in the SOR \nAmendment to apply to this case: \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \nApplicant is on probation until 2023 for his last DUI conviction. \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense;  \nand \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant had gone about a year without an alcohol-related criminal incident as of \nthe date of his hearing. However, as stated above, he has only recently made the decision \nto stop drinking. Based on the available record, it is not possible to say with any certainty \nthat alcohol-related criminal incidents will not happen in the future. Of particular concern \nis the fact that this recent period of good behavior occurred while he remains on probation \nand potential revocation of his national security eligibility is pending. Not enough time has \npassed to make a positive decision concerning Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness. Guideline J is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity significance of his alcohol use and related criminal conduct. The recent death of \nApplicant\u2019s wife was a terrible blow, and has been considered in this case as a possible \nmitigating factor. However, the evidence shows that Applicant is not yet ready to \nacknowledge the long-term adverse effects of his drinking. Not enough time has passed \nto establish confidence that recurrence is unlikely. Overall, the record evidence does \ncreate substantial doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n                                                \n \n \n \n \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n",
