Petcher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/13/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant used marijuana from November 2012 to at least December 2017. He \npurchased marijuana from 2012 through at least September 2016. He denies any intention \nof using marijuana in the future, but he continues to associate with friends who use \nmarijuana, including at times in his presence. The risk of Applicant using marijuana in the \nfuture cannot be discounted. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 23, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct, which explained why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, to all \nadjudications for national security eligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n\n2 \n \nOn June 11, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On July 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On August 6, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for September 17, 2018. \n \nApplicant failed to show for his hearing. On subsequent contact with Applicant, he \nindicated that he had not received the notice scheduling the hearing. He explained that he \nhad moved, but also that he had failed to inform the DOD of his current address. On \nSeptember 26, 2018, I notified Applicant that I would not default him for failure to appear \nunder the circumstances and that his hearing would be heard on a date yet to be \ndetermined. \n \nOn January 15, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for February 12, 2019. With the \nagreement of the parties, on February 6, 2019, I issued an Amended Notice of Hearing \nchanging the start time for the hearing. At the hearing on February 12, 2019, two \nGovernment exhibits (GEs 1-2) were admitted into evidence. A June 25, 2018 letter \nforwarding discovery of the GEs and a list of the Government exhibits were incorporated in \nthe record as hearing exhibits (HE I-II), but not admitted as evidence. Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on February 27, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is alleged under Guideline H (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and cross-alleged under \nGuideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.a) to have used marijuana with varying frequency from \napproximately November 2012 to at least December 2017, and to have purchased \nmarijuana with varying frequency from approximately November 2012 to at least December \n2017 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a). When he answered the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted that \nhe had used marijuana as alleged and that he had purchased marijuana, but that his last \npurchase was in 2016 or perhaps January or February 2017. After considering his \nresponse to the SOR, the exhibits, and the hearing transcript, I make the following findings \nof fact: \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old systems engineer. He has Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s \ndegrees in mechanical engineering, and has been employed by a defense contractor since \nJune 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 21-22.) He has never held a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 25.) \n \nApplicant started college in September 2012. He began using marijuana in \nNovember 2012 because he wanted to try it. He performed well on his mid-terms, and so \nhe decided to continue to use a drug that he enjoyed, even though he knew that it was \nillegal. He used marijuana throughout college until January 2017, at a frequency that \n\u201cvaried quite a bit.\u201d At one point during his freshman year, he may have used marijuana \n\u201cfive times a week.\u201d Other times, he went five to six months without using marijuana. He \nused marijuana primarily while socializing with close friends, and the marijuana was usually \nprovided to him at no cost. He used marijuana in all kinds of forms\u2014joints, bongs, pipes, \nand edibles\u2014depending on what his friends had. He purchased marijuana in small \n\n3 \n \nquantities at a cost of less than $50 on a handful of occasions, about once a year, to at \nleast September 2016. Applicant purchased the marijuana from friends of friends. He \nestimates that he spent $200 to $300 for marijuana over five years. He shared with friends \nsome of the marijuana he purchased. He drove a vehicle after smoking marijuana only \nonce, which was either during his junior or senior year of college. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 26-33, 45.) \n \nAfter earning his Master\u2019s degree in May 2017, Applicant began working for his \ncurrent employer. He passed a pre-employment drug screen, and received training about \nhis employer\u2019s policies, including that illegal drug use is prohibited. (Tr. 23.) On July 12, \n2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) on which he disclosed that he had used and purchased \nmarijuana. He indicated that he was an \u201cinfrequent user\u201d of marijuana between November \n2012 and January 2017, but he had stopped using the drug. He denied any intention to use \nmarijuana in the future but then explained: \n \nThe state of [name omitted] has made it legal despite it currently being illegal \nunder federal law. I do not have any plans to smoke in the near future. I, \nhowever, might if it is made legal under federal law. \n \n \nApplicant also responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning any illegal purchase \nof a drug or controlled substance in the last seven years. He indicated that he bought \nmarijuana between February 2013 and September 2016 in small amounts, \u201cless than $50 \nworth, on a handful of occasions throughout college.\u201d He denied any intention to purchase \nmarijuana in the future. (GE 1; Tr. 26.) Applicant understood that his use of marijuana \ncould be an issue for his security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 26.) \n \n \nOn January 30, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM), primarily to discuss his marijuana use and \npurchase. Applicant explained that he smoked marijuana in college with friends, but he \nalso experimented with edibles. Most of the time, he obtained his marijuana free of charge \nfrom friends who had it, but that once a year, he purchased marijuana from friends of \nfriends. Applicant stated that he stopped using marijuana because he got bored of it, but \nhe also volunteered that he used marijuana at the party hosted by four of his former \nroommates on December 31, 2017. He took some puffs from a marijuana joint passed to \nhim by friends of friends.1  Applicant acknowledged that he knew using marijuana was \nillegal under federal law and that his employer had a policy prohibiting illegal drug \ninvolvement. However, he expressed his belief that marijuana should be legalized. \nReminded by the investigator that drug use violates not only federal law but also his \nemployer\u2019s policy, he expressed a belief that his employer should not be able to infringe on \nhis personal use. Applicant stated that he has no current intentions of using marijuana but \nhe may in the future. He reportedly acknowledged that he still associated with persons \ninvolved with marijuana and named nine individuals, including one of the character \nreferences he named on his SF 86 and a friend from college (friend X) with whom he \nsmoked marijuana in the past. Applicant explained that his friends knew of his marijuana \n                                                 \n1 At his hearing, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana at the party but not with his former roommates. He \ndenied ever using marijuana with the friends who hosted the party. (Tr. 35-36.) \n\n4 \n \nuse but his family did not. Applicant admitted that he had not notified security officials at \nwork about his recent marijuana use. (GE 2.) \n \n \nDOHA sent interrogatories to Applicant in March 2018 about his drug use. Asked to \ndetail his use of marijuana from November 2012 to date, Applicant responded that he used \ncannabis from November 2012 to December 2017. He denied ever purchasing marijuana. \nRegarding his future intentions, Applicant stated, \u201cNot interested in smoking. Does not \nprovide me any benefits. My friends don\u2019t smoke. Impacts my workouts. Waste of money.\u201d \nApplicant was given the summary of the OPM investigator\u2019s report of his January 2018 \ninterview and was advised he could make corrections to the report. With regard to his \nreported continued association with drug users, Applicant indicated on March 21, 2018,2 \nthat the names listed \u201cdo not reflect people involved in drug activity.\u201d Instead, he named \nthose persons with whom he socializes on a regular basis and he added, \u201cAll of them \ncurrently have no drug activity to the best of my knowledge. Some have never taken a drug \nillegally.\u201d In a separate handwritten statement, he listed eight of the nine persons identified \nin the interview summary (including the four former roommates that hosted the December \n2017 party at which he used marijuana but not college friend X) and expressed his belief \nthat they would all pass a drug test today. Applicant explained that he omitted friend X \nbecause he lives outside the area, and indicated that he was unaware about friend X\u2019s \ncurrent relationship with marijuana. Applicant added, \u201cI have not smoked marijuana since \nthe year 2017. I do not intend to [use marijuana] in the future.\u201d (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant has not told security officials at work about his marijuana use. He testified \nthat the OPM interviewer told him security would be notified through the security process. \n(Tr. 24, 40-41.) Applicant briefly discussed with his co-workers and managers the issue of \nhis drug use \u201cbut not in maybe a full disclosure kind of sense.\u201d He is not currently required \nto possess a security clearance to maintain his employment. (Tr. 23-24.) \n \n \nApplicant last used marijuana at the party held on December 31, 2017, perhaps \nduring the early hours of January 1, 2018. (Tr. 27.) To his recollection, he last purchased \nmarijuana in September 2016. (Tr. 28.) As to why he used marijuana at the New Year\u2019s \nEve party, Applicant testified that he was frustrated that he had not heard back about his \nclearance eligibility, particularly where he knew of some co-workers who had either lied on \ntheir clearance forms or continued to smoke marijuana while employed, and he had been \n\u201chonest and upfront\u201d about his marijuana use. Also he was considering leaving his job with \nthe defense contractor because he did not have very interesting work, and he had \u201ca \ncarefree attitude\u201d in that he \u201cfelt as though it would not matter and it wouldn\u2019t come back to \nbite [him].\u201d (Tr. 33-34.) Applicant disagrees with his employer\u2019s prohibition against illegal \ndrug use by its employees, but he has followed it since his last use at the New Year\u2019s Eve \nparty. (Tr. 38.) \n \n \nApplicant has friends who smoke marijuana. In the six months preceding his \nFebruary 2018 hearing, Applicant has been in the presence of others using marijuana \napproximately six times to as recently as late 2018 or early 2019. Some of the friends who \n                                                 \n2 Applicant\u2019s response was returned to him on April 4, 2018, to obtain a notarized signature. Applicant signed \nthe document before a notary on May 3, 2018. (GE 2.) \n\n5 \n \nused marijuana in his presence were named in his March 2018 response to interrogatories \nas persons who he claimed would pass a drug screen because they were not then using \nmarijuana.  When asked to explain the discrepancy, Applicant indicated that those friends \nhad not used marijuana in several months as of March 2018, but that he knows them to \nhave used marijuana since then. He then indicated that it was \u201cprobably not accurate\u201d for \nhim to have stated in March 2018 that he was not associating with any known drug users. \nHe meant to state that the friends with whom he spent most of his time were not using \ndrugs. He denied knowing whether they currently use marijuana but acknowledged that the \nfriends have used marijuana in his presence in the last six months; that he continues to \nsocialize with them; and that they have offered him some marijuana, including after he had \ntold them that he cannot smoke marijuana because of his job. He indicated that he has \nmade it clear to them that he is \u201cnot looking to smoke.\u201d (Tr. 41-45, 48-49.) When asked \nwhy he continued to associate with known drug users while a hearing was pending for his \nclearance eligibility, Applicant responded: \n \nSo oftentimes, I do leave the room, if there\u2019s a specific room. I would say I \nnow have family members that grow marijuana, a cousin of mine,3 you know, \nthat they\u2019ve been\u2014I would say, they\u2019re\u2014it\u2019s\u2014if I had to disassociate myself \nentirely, where there was any possibility that someone smoked weed, I would \nhave to have significant social change. (Tr. 48.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \n                                                 \n3 Applicant denied ever being around a family member that was smoking marijuana, however. (Tr. 50.) \n\n6 \n \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency while in college and graduate \nschool from November 2012 to January 2017. After going to work for his employer in June \n2017, and completing an SF 86 in July 2017 on which he indicated that he did not intend to \nuse marijuana in the future, Applicant used marijuana at least once, on December 31, \n2017, or January 1, 2018. Applicant purchased marijuana on occasion, spending about \n$200 to $300 total, between November 2012 and September 2016. Disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse (see above definition),\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(c), \n\u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d are \nestablished. Moreover, during his subject interview on January 30, 2018, Applicant \nindicated that he had no current intention of using marijuana, but that he may use it in the \nfuture. He expressed his disagreement with the federal government\u2019s and his employer\u2019s \n\n7 \n \nprohibitions of marijuana use. He used marijuana at least once after he expressed an \nintention not to use it in the future. Under the circumstances, I find that AG \u00b6 25(g), \n\u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly \nand convincingly commit to discontinue such use,\u201d also applies. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) provides for mitigation when the drug involvement and substance misuse \n\u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was part of his recreational \nlifestyle in college and, by his own admission, something that he enjoyed while socializing \nwith friends. He used marijuana with friends of friends on December 31, 2017, or January \n1, 2018. His marijuana use was too recurrent and too recent for mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n26(a). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) provides for mitigation when an individual acknowledges his or her drug \ninvolvement and has no intention of future drug activity: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \nApplicant indicated in response to DOHA interrogatories in March 2018 and at his \nhearing in February 2019 that he does not intend to use any marijuana in the future. His \nstatement in that regard does not include an acknowledgement of revocation of any \nsecurity clearance eligibility for any violation, but he clearly understands the consequences \nfor any future illegal drug use. There is no evidence that he has used any marijuana since \nDecember 31, 2017, or January 1, 2018, and his forthright disclosure of his marijuana use \nat that party is viewed favorably. However, AG \u00b6 26(b) cannot reasonably apply because \nApplicant continues to associate with some friends who use marijuana. He claims he has \nmade it abundantly clear to his friends that he cannot use marijuana for his job, and yet six \ntimes in the last six months or so, some friends smoked marijuana in his presence. \nApplicant acknowledged that, to completely disassociate himself from the possibility of \nsomeone smoking marijuana, he would need significant social change. The risk of \nApplicant using marijuana in the future cannot be adequately discounted. The drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are not sufficiently mitigated. \n\n8 \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \nConcerning the Government\u2019s case for disqualification under the personal conduct \nguideline because of Applicant\u2019s marijuana uses and purchases (SOR \u00b6 2.a), the Appeal \nBoard has held that security-related conduct can be considered under more than one \nguideline, and in an appropriate case, be given independent weight under each. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-06672 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2012). Applicant exercised \u201cquestionable judgment\u201d \nwithin the general security concerns set forth in AG \u00b6 15 when he repeatedly used \nmarijuana and purchased it in knowing disregard of its illegality. Separate from the risk of \nphysiological impairment associated with the use of a mood-altering substance, which is a \nGuideline H concern, Applicant had an obligation as a defense-contractor employee \nseeking a security clearance to comply with the DOD\u2019s and his employer\u2019s policies \nprohibiting illegal drug use, and he used marijuana at least one time after he had applied \nfor a DOD clearance. AG \u00b6 16(d) provides:  \n  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself of an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of:  \n  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.  \n  \nApplicant admitted to an OPM investigator in January 2018 that he was aware that \nhis marijuana use only thirty days or so prior was contrary to his employer\u2019s policy \nprohibiting illegal drug use. His explanation for that drug use is that he was frustrated that \nhe had not obtained his clearance, and he was dissatisfied with his job duties. Even \nassuming that he knew of co-workers who had lied about their drug use on their security \nclearance applications or continued to use drugs in contravention of federal law and their \nemployer\u2019s policy, it does not excuse or mitigate his own disregard of law and policy. \n \nApplicant exhibited some reform under AG \u00b6 17(d) by volunteering to the OPM \ninvestigator that he had used marijuana while a defense-contractor employee after he \nsubmitted his SF 86. AG \u00b6 17(d) provides: \n\n9 \n \n  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n \nThe government has a reasonable expectation of candor from those persons who \nseek to be granted access to the Nation\u2019s secrets, and in that regard, his voluntary \ndisclosure against self-interest does not entitle him to a clearance. In assessing his reform \nof his drug involvement, I cannot ignore that he continues to socialize with some persons \nwho use marijuana. Applicant may have no control over his friends\u2019 decisions to use \nmarijuana, but he chooses his own associates and recreational activities. He may never \nhave used marijuana with two of his closest friends, but on at least six occasions in the last \nsix months or so, he has been in the presence of other friends while they were smoking \nmarijuana. Some of those friends were named by him in March 2018 as persons not \ncurrently involved in drug activity to his knowledge. Applicant has expressed his belief that \nmarijuana should be legalized under federal law. He testified that to eliminate \u201cany \npossibility that someone smoked weed, [he] would have to have significant social change.\u201d \nUnder the circumstances, it is difficult to find under AG \u00b6 17(d) that his marijuana use is \nunlikely to recur. The personal conduct security concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).4 Applicant can disagree with federal drug law and policy without negative \nconsequences for his security clearance eligibility provided he does not act to violate the \nlaw or policy. By using marijuana in knowing disregard of federal law and the DOD\u2019s and \nhis employer\u2019s policies, Applicant cast serious doubt about whether he can be counted on \nto comply with the requirements for handling classified information. \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended to punish applicants for past \ntransgressions. Yet it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). The \nGovernment must be able to rely on those persons granted security clearance eligibility to \nfulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, regulations, and policies, and without regard \n                                                 \n4 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows:  \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n10 \n \nto their personal interests. For the reasons discussed, Applicant has raised enough doubt \nin that regard to where I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for a security clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He filed his federal and state tax \nreturns for tax years 2016 and 2017 after he received the statement of reasons (SOR). \nGuidelines D (sexual behavior), J (criminal conduct), F (financial considerations), and E \n(personal conduct) security concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified information \nis denied.      \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 13, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On May 21, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive \n5220.6, and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \n02/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

On September 27, \n2018, the case was assigned to me. On October 10, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for November 15, \n2018. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDepartment Counsel offered 11 exhibits; there were no objections to the \ndocuments; and they were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 19-21; Government Exhibit (GE) \n1-11) Applicant did not offer any exhibits at his hearing. (Tr. 16) I received emails and \ndocuments after Applicant\u2019s hearing, which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-\nAE I. On December 7, 2018, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the hearing.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 2.a, \n2.b, 3.a, 3.c, and 4.a. He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 48 years old, and he is employed by a defense contractor as a cyber-\nsecurity specialist and penetration tester. (Tr. 6, 24; GE 1) He has worked in this area for \nthe defense contractor for three years. (Tr. 7) In 1988, he graduated from high school. \n(Tr. 6, 24) In 2005, he graduated from a university and received a bachelor\u2019s degree; \nhowever, the physical diploma was lost, and despite \u201cback and forth\u201d between Applicant \nand the university, he was unable to get another copy of the diploma.

(Tr. 25) He \nintends to complete another \u201cyear or so\u201d of classes so he can receive another bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. (Tr. 6; AE B; AE H) In 2007, he received an on-line master\u2019s degree; however, \nhe later discovered the degree program was fraudulent, and his degree was \u201cnullified.\u201d \n(Tr. 6, 30-32; AE A) He established a cyber-security business in 2010, and he received \nseveral awards. (Tr. 112)  \n \nApplicant served in the Army from August 1988 to August 1991. (Tr. 7) His Army \nmilitary occupational specialty (MOS) was encrypted signal interceptor. (Tr. 7-8) While he \nwas in the Army, he held a top secret clearance with access to sensitive compartmented \ninformation. (Tr. 8) He served in Panama during Operation Just Cause. (Tr. 113) In 1991, \nhis security clearance was revoked. (Tr. 8)  \n \nApplicant has never married. (Tr. 32) His four children are ages 16, 17, 20, and 21. \n(Tr. 32-33, 109) In November 2018, his 22-year-old son was shot and killed. (Tr. 17, 33)  \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nSexual Behavior \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges in April 1991, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment (NJP) \nfor four acts of voyeurism, in violation of Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice \n(UCMJ). A military police report indicates a person generally fitting Applicant\u2019s description \nwas inside the female shower area looking at female soldiers coming out of or inside the \nshowers on four occasions from December 26, 1990, to January 17, 1991. (GE 11 at 5-\n7) He received company grade NJP of forfeiture of 7 days of pay, reduction from specialisr \nto private first class, 14 days of restriction, and 14 days of extra duty. (GE 11 at 4) In May \n1991, Applicant wrote a statement addressed to his company commander in which he \nadmitted he had a problem with voyeurism; he traced his problem to sexual abuse when \nhe was a child and unresolved anger; he wanted therapy; and he requested a discharge \nfrom the Army. (GE 11 at 2-3) At his hearing, he said he was outside someone\u2019s room \nlooking in, and he viewed people inappropriately on two or three occasions. (Tr. 58) He \nsaid he was caught each time he did it. (Tr. 58) He received some therapy before he was \ndischarged from the Army. (Tr. 60) In August 1991, he received a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions for misconduct. After he was discharged from the Army and \ncontinuing until the middle of 1993, he received therapy to recognize and resist triggers \nfor voyeurism. (Tr. 62) The triggers to his desire for voyeurism were emotional extremes \nsuch as becoming too angry, hungry, or lonely. (Tr. 62) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges in April 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with four \ncounts of aggravated sexual battery. Applicant said that because he was angry about his \nlife, particularly his lack of financial success and low-paying employment, he \u201cgraduated\u201d \nfrom voyeurism to \u201cfrottage.\u201d (Tr. 63) According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, \nfrottage is \u201cthe act of obtaining sexual stimulation by rubbing against a person or object.\u201d \nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frottage. Applicant said he was in a club, \nand someone touched a woman inappropriately on her rear. (Tr. 64) He may have \nbumped her. (Tr. 64) She accused Applicant of touching her inappropriately, and he was \narrested and charged with sexual assault. (Tr. 64) Applicant pleaded guilty to sexual \nassault. (Tr. 64) In his SOR response, he said, \u201cAgainst my own desire, I touched a \nwoman inappropriately in a public place.\u201d At his hearing, he denied that he touched her \ninappropriately. (Tr. 65) He subsequently admitted he touched one woman \ninappropriately; however, he denied that he touched the other three women. (Tr. 66) He \nsaid that \u201c[o]ut of camaraderie, they all said that I did.\u201d (Tr. 66)1 He conceded that he \npleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault on four women. (Tr. 67-68) He claimed he \nonly touched one woman, and the touching was unintentional and not sexual. (Tr. 67-68) \nHe pleaded guilty because the prosecutor reduced the four felony-level aggravated \nsexual battery charges to four misdemeanor-level sexual battery charges. (Tr. 68-69) He \n                                            \n1 In his August 1, 2016 Officer of Personnel Management personal subject interview (OPM PSI), \nApplicant said in 1992 or 1995, he was walking on the street and touched a woman\u2019s breast. (GE 2 at 15) \nHe did not realize he touched the woman\u2019s breast. (GE 2 at 15) In his November 15, 2016 OPM PSI, he \nsaid that the act was not intentional or conscious. (GE 2 at 21) He was arrested for sexual assault. (GE 2 \nat 15) A 1992 police report indicates Applicant was riding a bicycle and he reached out and grabbed a \nwoman\u2019s breast. (GE 3) He was charged with sexual assault. (GE 3) The disposition of this allegation is \nunknown. It was not addressed during his hearing, and it was not alleged in the statement of reasons (SOR). \nNo adverse inference is made against Applicant because of this allegation.  \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nserved 30 days for each misdemeanor-level conviction and paid a substantial fine \n(between $1,000 and $2,000). (Tr. 69-70) He was on probation for three years. (Tr. 70)          \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges in September 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nsolicitation of prostitution. Applicant went with an undercover police woman to a motel, \nand when he arrived, some police came out of the bathroom and arrested him. (Tr. 74-\n76) He was found guilty of soliciting a prostitute and fined $335. (Tr. 75) He denied that \nhe offered the undercover police woman any money. (Tr. 75-76) The police report states, \n\u201cThe subject wanted to commit a sex act for $30.00.\u201d (GE 5 at 3) He said he pleaded \nguilty without admitting that he offered her money for sex. (Tr. 75) \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6 1. SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that in \nDecember 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with petit larceny. (GE 4) An \nemployee of a drug store said Applicant picked up two items and walked out of the store. \n(Tr. 80) The police accused Applicant of stealing. (Tr. 78) Applicant pleaded not guilty \nand told the judge he purchased the items earlier from a different store. (Tr. 79) The judge \nfound him guilty of petty larceny, and Applicant believed he was convicted because he \nwas unable to produce the receipts for the items. (Tr. 79) He was sentenced to 12 months \nin jail with 10 months suspended. (Tr. 81) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that in July 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with petty \ntheft. Applicant said he was in a store and someone left their wallet at the register. (Tr. \n82) Applicant took the wallet and attempted to return it to its owner who was outside the \nstore. (Tr. 83) The wallet was returned to the owner. (Tr. 83) The owner said $200 was \nmissing from his wallet. (Tr. 83) Applicant was convicted of \u201cpetty larceny.\u201d (Tr. 84-85) He \nreceived a $200 fine and was required to pay $150 in court costs. (Tr. 84)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from August 2012, to June 2014, and from November \n2014 to December 2015. (Tr. 45-46, 49) He lived in a homeless shelter for two months, \nand he lived in his car for a time. (Tr. 48-49) He used the unemployment time to burnish \nhis credentials and earn information technology certifications. (Tr. 46) He recently \nreceived several salary increases, and his current salary is around $104,000. (Tr. 45, 100) \nHe receives 30 percent disability pay ($497 monthly) from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. (Tr. 108) \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges the following financial issues: \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges his student loan for $2,272 was charged off. Applicant is \ncurrently enrolled in college, and he believed the correct loan status should be deferred. \n(Tr. 40) He has about $12,000 in student loans that are not deferred because he \u201ctook a \npause at school.\u201d (Tr. 73) He owes approximately $46,000 in student loans and they are \nin deferment because he has been enrolled in a bachelor\u2019s degree program since 2016. \n(AE B) This debt is mitigated. \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.b alleges a collection debt for $350. Applicant was unaware of the source \nof the debt, and he used a credit repair company to dispute his responsibility for it. (Tr. \n42-43) This is the only SOR debt in collections. Applicant is credited with mitigating this \ndebt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.c alleges a delinquent child-support debt for $55,584 owed to a state \ndepartment of social services. Applicant said he started paying child support in 1996 or \n1997. (Tr. 36) He said he consistently made child-support payments for the past three \nyears, and whenever possible he pays extra to reduce the arrearage. (Tr. 87) In his \nNovember 15, 2016 Officer of Personnel Management personal subject interview, \nApplicant said his child-support arrearage was $46,715. (GE 2 at 21) His current \narrearage is about $48,000. (Tr. 72) In October 2018, he owed the following amounts for \nfour children: $22,613; $9,988; $3,900; and $11,728, for a total of $48,229. (Tr. 71; AE \nG) He currently pays $475 through a wage withholding or garnishment2 for one child and \n$475 for his arrearage or a total of $950 per two-week pay period. (Tr. 36-37, 100) He \nsaid this amounts to $1,400 or $1,400 monthly. (Tr. 100) He said he pays extra each \nmonth in addition to the wage withholding. (Tr. 38) His November 16, 2018 child-support \nstatement indicated he paid $760. (AE G) In June 2018, he ended the garnishment and \nis voluntarily paying his child-support debt. (AE A; AE G) This debt is not mitigated. \n \nApplicant was unsure when he filed his federal income tax returns for tax years \n2014 and 2015. (Tr. 114) He said he had not \u201ccompletely\u201d filed tax returns for the last five \nyears. (Tr. 113, 115) He said, \u201cI have not filed taxes for 2017 yet, but I have filed taxes \nfor \u201915 and \u201914.\u201d (Tr. 114) He said he filed his 2016 tax return. (Tr. 114) I asked him to \nprovide his Internal Revenue Service Form 1040s for the previous three years. (Tr. 116) \nApplicant did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s proposed amendment of the SOR to \nadd SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.d through 3.g.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.d and 3.e allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2016 and 2017. (Tr. 117) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.f and 3.g allege Applicant failed \nto timely file his state income tax return for tax years 2016 and 2017. (Tr. 117) \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s hearing, he provided documentation depicted in the following \ntable for tax years 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017 (not 2015). \n \n                                            \n2 Of course, Applicant loses some mitigating credit because his child support payments were made \nthrough garnishment of his salary even though his opportunity to establish a payment plan may have been \nlimited at times because of unemployment, lack of income, and other financial commitments. Payment of a \ndebt \u201cthough garnishment rather than a voluntary effort diminishes its mitigating force.\u201d Compare ISCR \nCase No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, \n2006) (payment of two of four debts through garnishment did not bar mitigation of financial considerations \nconcerns). See also ISCR Case No. 09-05700 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011) (garnished payments towards \ndelinquent tax debts is not mitigating information in light of other factors); ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009) (remanding the case to the administrative judge and stating when addressing an \nInternal Revenue Service garnishment, \u201cOn its face, satisfaction of a debt through the involuntary \nestablishment of a creditor\u2019s garnishment is not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of \nrepayment by the debtor.\u201d). \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nTax Year \nDate Filed  \n Adjusted Gross \nIn come \nFederal Income \nTax Refund \nSource \n2013 \nDec. 14, 2018 \n$7,4813 \n$209 \nAE C, F \n2014 \nDec. 14, 2018 \n$50,311 \n$2,165 \nAE D, F \n2016 \nDec. 14, 2018 \n$66,935 \n \nAE F \n2017 \nDec. 14, 2018 \n$84,804 \n$1,007 \nAE F \n  \nApplicant\u2019s state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, 2016, \nand 2017 did not indicate that he owed any federal or state income taxes. (AE C-AE F) \nApplicant said he did not need to file a tax return for tax year 2012 because his income \nwas too low, and he said his tax preparation service said he did not need to file tax returns \nif it was more than six years ago. (AE A) If the IRS wants to pursue tax evasion or related \ncharges, it must do this within six years from the date the unfiled return was due. This six-\nyear time limit does not remove the requirement to file tax returns prior to 2012. No \nadverse inference is made about whether Applicant has failed to file or timely file tax \nreturns other than those for tax years 2014, 2016, and 2017.   \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nSOR \u00b6 4.a alleges that Applicant was terminated from his employment in January \n2016 for viewing inappropriate material on a computer while at work. (Tr. 51-57) While at \nwork, he was on a website where women do \u201csilly things\u201d such as \u201ctwerking\u201d or \u201cshaking \ntheir butts.\u201d (Tr. 53) He said not all of the videos on the website are sexually oriented. (Tr. \n55) He was working at the front desk of a hotel, and another employee saw the \ninappropriate video and reported him to management. (Tr. 53) He said the problem was \nhe walked away from the desk, and he failed to close out the video. (Tr. 53) The time he \nwas caught on the website at work was not the first time he viewed material from that \nwebsite at work. (Tr. 56-57) SOR \u00b6 4.b cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 \nand 2. \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant provided 19 pages of letters and emails positively describing his work \nand contributions to his community from 1996 to 2011. (AE I) The statements laud his \nintegrity, responsibility, dependability, and intelligence. (AE I) He worked numerous hours \nas a volunteer and often helped others with computer problems. (AE H) He presented \ncertificates and diplomas, dated from 1996 to 2015, documenting his training and \neducation accomplishments.   \n \n \n \n                                            \n3 The income threshold for filing his 2013 tax return was $10,000 (filing status single under age 65), \nand Applicant was not required to file a tax return for tax year 2013. See IRS Publication 501, Cat. No. \n15000U, Exemptions, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information For use in preparing 2013 Returns at 2 \n(Dec 03, 2013), https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p501--2013.pdf. \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n  \n \nSexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 describes the security concern raised by sexual behavior as follows: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress \ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \nIn 1991, while Applicant was in the Army, he engaged in four acts of voyeurism, \nwhen he viewed female soldiers in showers. He received nonjudicial punishment and a \ngeneral discharge under honorable conditions for misconduct. In 1994, Applicant touched \nfour women in an inappropriate sexual manner. He was arrested and charged with four \ncounts of aggravated sexual battery. He was convicted of four counts of misdemeanor-\nlevel sexual battery.  In 2005, he solicited a sex act for money from an undercover police \nwoman, and he was convicted of solicitation of prostitution. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d) \nare established and consideration of potential mitigating conditions is required. \n  \nAG \u00b6 14 describes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and  \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c) \npartially apply. Applicant received some therapy in 1992 and 1993. He has a good \nunderstanding of emotions that may trigger sex crimes. His most recent conviction for a \nsex crime was in 2005, and his sex crimes are not recent. He provided multiple character \nletters attesting to his good behavior and contributions to his employer and community. \nDesire for self-improvement is exemplified by the numerous certifications and diplomas \nhe earned. His good work performance is shown by a series of raises he has received \nfrom his current employer.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Additional sexual crimes \noccurred after he received therapy. There is a lingering concern that future criminal sexual \nbehavior will occur because he committed multiple sexual offenses, and he failed to \naccept full responsibility at his hearing for his criminal conduct. He committed four \nvoyeurism criminal offenses against female soldiers when he was in the Army, and after \nhe left the Army, he received five misdemeanor-level convictions in civilian court (four \nsexual assaults and one solicitation of prostitution crimes). He essentially claimed that he \nwas not criminally responsible for any of the offenses of which he was convicted. Sexual \nbehavior security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) are established for the reasons stated in the previous \nsection. In addition, Applicant committed thefts in 2005 and 2010, and he was convicted \nof \u201cpetty larceny.\u201d    \n \nAG \u00b6 32 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant receives partial mitigation credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) for the \nsame reasons that AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c) in the previous section partially apply. Criminal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated as explained in the sexual behavior section. \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 describes the security concern about personal conduct as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying as follows: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources; \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are established for the reasons stated in the previous sexual \nbehavior and criminal conduct sections. In addition, Applicant viewed inappropriate \nmaterial on a computer at work and was terminated from his employment.     \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case as \nfollows: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant receives partial mitigation credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) for \nthe same reasons that AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c) in the sexual behavior section partially \napply. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated as explained in the sexual \nbehavior section. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) \na history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns as required . . . .\u201d Applicant admitted that he failed to timely \nfile his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017.  He owes about $48,000 \nin delinquent child support. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability \nof mitigating conditions.  \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \nSeven mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;4   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nNo mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some mitigating \ninformation. He had variations in his income, and periods of unemployment after leaving \nthe Army. These unusual circumstances were beyond Applicant\u2019s control and caused or \ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s financial problems. In June 2018, he ended the garnishment of \n                                            \n4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n  \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \nhis pay for child support, and in the last three years, he had decreased his child-support \ndebt arrearage by several thousand dollars. He is credited with mitigation of the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.c. Applicant receives significant mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(g) \nbecause there is no evidence that he owes any federal or state income taxes, and he filed \nhis overdue tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017. His income over the \nlast three years has increased, and his annual income is now around $104,000.    \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2014, 2016, and 2017. 5 The DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the \napplicant\u2019s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent \nsuch problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness in light of [applicant\u2019s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case \n                                            \n5 Applicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that he did not timely file his federal and state tax returns for tax \nyear 2014. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd.

Oct. 26, 2006)).  \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file his state and federal tax returns for tax year 2014 will not be considered \nexcept for the five purposes listed above.  \n\n \n15 \n                                         \n \nNo. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d \napproach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d \nanalysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus \non timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant receives substantial credit for getting his federal and state \ntax returns filed in December 2018, and establishing he does not owe any taxes. \nHowever, he failed to timely file his tax returns for 2014, 2016, and 2017. Financial \nconsiderations concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D, J, F, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is 48 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor as \na cyber-security specialist and penetration tester for three years. In 2005, he graduated \nfrom a university and received a bachelor\u2019s degree. In December 2011, he received a \ntechnical information technology certification. He intends to complete another \u201cyear or so\u201d \nof classes so he can receive another bachelor\u2019s degree. In 2007, he received an on-line \nmaster\u2019s degree; however, he later discovered the degree program was fraudulent, and \nhis degree was \u201cnullified.\u201d He established a cyber-security business in 2010, and he \nreceived several awards.  \n \nLetters and emails positively describe Applicant\u2019s work and contributions to his \ncommunity. He worked numerous hours as a volunteer and often helped others with \ncomputer problems. He diligently endeavored to improve his knowledge and credentials.   \n \nApplicant served in the Army from August 1988 to August 1991. His Army MOS \nwas encrypted signal interceptor. While he was in the Army, he held a top secret \n\n \n16 \n                                         \n \nclearance with access to sensitive compartmented information. He served in Panama \nduring Operation Just Cause.    \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of failing to timely file his federal and state income tax returns \nwhen due raises unresolved financial considerations security concerns.6 When an issue \ninvolving taxes is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how long an \napplicant waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax returns, and \nhow long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete making \npayments.7 It is a positive development that Applicant filed his federal and state tax \nreturns for tax years 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017. However, the primary financial \nconsiderations problem here is that Applicant did not timely file his federal and state tax \nreturns for tax years 2014, 2016, and 2017 until December 2018.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person.

Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents \nan obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets.

July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance \nand stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only \nafter his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd.

Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except \nfor $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income \nof over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse\u2019s medical \nproblems. The Appeal Board emphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first \nplace stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and \nsystems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, \nGuideline H, drug involvement and substance abuse, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86)1 on \nMay 12, 2014. On March 21, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guidelines G, H, and J.2 \n1 Also known as a Security Clearance Application (SCA). \n2 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n02/26/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 16, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of \nhearing on August 1, 2018, and the hearing was convened on August 29, 2018. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were offered, however based on Applicant\u2019s \nobjections, GE 2 through 4 (Personal Subject Interview summaries) were not admitted. \nGE 1, and 5 through 7 were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE) A \nthrough C were admitted in evidence without objection. The record was held open after \nthe hearing to permit Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence in mitigation. \nApplicant submitted AE D, which was admitted without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on September 7, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline G, that Applicant has a history of excessive \nalcohol consumption, including after treatment. Applicant was also charged with alcohol-\nrelated offenses including: two charges in 1997 for underage possession of alcohol, and \ndriving while intoxicated (DWI) with a minor under 15 years old. The SOR cross-alleged \nthe DWI arrest under Guideline J, criminal conduct. Additionally, the SOR alleges under \nGuideline H that Applicant used marijuana from 1993 to at least 2015, including while \nholding a security clearance in 2015, and misused two prescription medications from \nSeptember to October 2011, while holding a security clearance. In Applicant\u2019s answer, \nshe admitted all of the allegations with explanations, except she denied the extent of her \nalcohol use after treatment, and denied use of marijuana after 2000, except for one time \nin May 2015. The record evidence substantially supports the SOR allegations. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old software engineer, employed by a defense contractor \nsince 2001. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2001. She married in 2005 and divorced \nin 2013. She has two children, ages 12 and 17. She has held a security clearance since \n2003. \n \nApplicant was twice cited for underage possession of alcohol in 1997, while a 19-\nyear-old college student, and also used marijuana on occasion until 2000. Applicant \nbegan working for her current employer after graduating from college in 2001. She was \nmarried in 2005 to a recovering alcoholic. Applicant struggled with her weight, and in \n2010, she had gastric bypass surgery and was getting knee injections for arthritis. She \nwas prescribed pain medications because she could no longer use over-the-counter pain \nmedication after surgery. At times, she used the medications even after the pain \nsubsided, so it was not in compliance with the prescription directions. \n \nApplicant considered herself a social drinker, but her beer and wine use also \nincreased after bypass surgery as a substitute for food. She stopped drinking in \nSeptember 2011, but had increased anxiety and depression. She was having difficulty in \nher marriage and her children had behavioral issues. She stopped drinking in September \n2011, sought counseling in October 2011 for anxiety and depression, and was \n\n \n3 \n \nrecommended to include treatment for alcohol abuse. She was tapered off the \nprescription medications as they were not permitted during treatment, and began \ntreatment for alcohol abuse, anxiety, and depression. She denied ever receiving a \ndiagnosis. She reported her treatment to her employer, continued with Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA), and successfully abstained from her self-imposed alcohol use until she \nrelapsed in 2015.  \n \nIn 2013, Applicant and her spouse divorced, and, at the same time, her employer \ntransferred her job to another state. She moved as a single mother of two children, with \nno friends, family, or other support. In 2015, Applicant\u2019s parents were visiting and helped \nher move from a rental property. After the move was completed, her father offered her \nalcohol. She had two mixed drinks, and, without feeling any effects, drove to a drug store \nfor bath products when she suddenly felt the effects of the alcohol. Her nine-year-old son \nmet her outside and insisted on riding to the store with her. She ran a red light, and was \nstruck by another car. She was cited for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and was convicted \nof misdemeanor DWI, fined, ordered to complete community service, probation for two \nyears, and required to use an ignition interlock device. One month later, after returning \nfrom work, Applicant stopped at a friend\u2019s house, drank, and used marijuana offered by \nthe friend. This was her first and only use of marijuana since 2000, and was related to her \ndrinking on that day. \n \nOn advice of her friend, Applicant checked herself into a hospital outpatient eight-\nweek alcohol treatment program with a psychiatrist, and reported that she was suffering \nfrom anxiety, stress, and being counseled at work for taking too many sick days. In 2015, \nApplicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent but met criteria for early partial remission. \nShe was advised to stop drinking, and was prescribed Antabuse to assist her with \ncravings. She stopped using alcohol, has successfully continued Antabuse without \nincident, successfully completed the two-year ignition interlock program without incident, \nand regularly attends AA and counseling with a therapist. Her psychiatrist and therapist \nprovided positive letters of support, indicating that she has been compliant with her \nmedications, attendance at AA and church. She has an AA sponsor and she is making \nimprovements in her mental health. Her AA sponsor wrote of her daily work with Applicant \nsince 2015, and despite a one-day relapse at a cookout in July 2017, Applicant \nreestablished sobriety immediately and reported her relapse in her AA meeting and to her \ncounselor. \n \nApplicant\u2019s friend testified on her behalf, was aware of her history and relapses, \nand noted her efforts at sobriety as discussed above. Her friend, was very supportive of \nher recovery. Her psychiatrist noted Applicant has developed better insight and is using \ngood judgment. With continued compliance with recommended treatment, Applicant\u2019s \nprognosis is \u201cvery good.\u201d   \n \nApplicant was straightforward, open and honest in her testimony. She \nacknowledged her struggle with alcohol, but was encouraged by her efforts at sobriety, \nabstinence, and treatment. She has made friends, and now has personal support that has \nsubstantially reduced her stress and anxiety. Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse, neighbor, friends, \n\n \n4 \n \nchurch members, and employment team leader strongly support her, noting Applicant\u2019s \nfriendship, love for her children, loyalty, and honesty. \n \nSince 2017, Applicant noted that she has performed well at work, winning several \nawards, including a prestigious, global company-wide award from the company\u2019s chief \nexecutive officer. This award noted Applicant\u2019s energy, ingenuity, and integrity. She has \nexceeded performance standards, and has a history of receiving monetary awards. She \nbelieves her home-life is stable, understands how to deal with stress, regularly uses her \nAntabuse medication and meets with her counselor and sponsor, and vowed to continue \nto abstain from any further alcohol or drug use. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n\n \n5 \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drinking history, which includes alcohol-related offenses in college, a \nDWI in 2015, and relapse after treatment, meets the conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \n(c), (d) and (f). \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23, including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \nApplicant acknowledges her history of struggles with alcohol. Her recognition of \nconditions that require intervention have resulted in her seeking treatment on two \noccasions. The first was in 2011 to address anxiety and depression, much of which was \nrelated to her marriage, and the second was in 2015 after her DWI and one-time use of \nmarijuana. As a result of her 2015 treatment, she was diagnosed as alcohol dependent, \nand proceeded with an intense treatment regiment. She had a brief, one-day relapse in \nJuly 2017, but quickly recovered her sobriety and it has continued to date. She now has \ntremendous support and has had exceptional performance at work. She continues her \nmedication, counseling, and AA participation. She keeps daily contact with her sponsor, \nand has vowed to remain abstinent. \n \n \nI find that sufficient time has passed since her last alcohol-related incident and \ndespite a one-day relapse, she has maintained substantial abstinence from alcohol and \nmarijuana since 2015. I am persuaded that her life changes, counseling and abstinence \nsupport serve to mitigate her past behavior. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related issues appear to \nbe under control, and no longer cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment as long as she maintains her compliance with her treatment regiment. I \nfind AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b) apply, and (c) and (d) partially apply. \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in  \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 25. \nThe disqualifying condition applicable in this case is: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \nApplicant reported her occasional use of marijuana in her youth, mostly while in \ncollege, and again one time in 2015 while drinking alcohol. She also reported her misuse \nof two prescription pain medications that she said were used outside of the label \ndirections. These incidents implicate the disqualifying condition noted above. \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n  (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n  (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n \n  (3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n\n \n8 \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended. \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who reported in her misuse of prescription medication \nin her SCA, and self-reported her one-time use of marijuana while drinking in 2015. She \nacknowledged that her incidents of drug misuse were likely related to her alcohol abuse \nproblem and from post-surgery and knee treatments. She has since abstained from any \nfurther illegal drug use or prescription misuse, and no longer associates with the person \nthat supplied marijuana in 2015. She expressed her regret for her lapse in judgment, and \nprovided a statement of intent to refrain from drug use or substance misuse. Applicant\u2019s \n2011 misuse of prescription medication and one-time use of marijuana in 2015 while \nrelapsing with alcohol was a temporary lapse in judgment that has not recurred. I am \nconvinced Applicant does not desire to use marijuana again, and that her promise to \nrefrain from future use and misuse of prescription medications is sincere. Her past use \nno longer reflects on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a), (b), and (c) apply. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, prosecuted or convicted. \n \nApplicant\u2019s DWI arrest and conviction is sufficient evidence of criminal conduct. \nAG \u00b6 31 (b) applies. \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n\n \n9 \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s DWI arrest and misdemeanor conviction occurred in 2015 and is an \nunusual circumstance. She has not had a similar offense before or after that incident. \nSince then, she has actively participated in group and individual counseling with a positive \nprognosis, completed a two-year ignition-interlock device program without violation, \nsuccessfully completed probation, and has substantially abstained from alcohol use. She \nused her DWI incident with her son in the car as a wake-up call to change her behavior \nthat led to criminal activity, and recognizes the impact that alcohol abuse has had on her \nlife and her family. She continues to attend AA meetings and counseling, and stresses \nthat alcohol use and resultant criminal conduct is behind her. I conclude that Applicant \nhas shown successful rehabilitation through the actions she has taken to regain control \nover her life, and as long as she continues to completely abstain from further alcohol use \nand counseling recommendations, additional criminal activity is unlikely to recur. Her past \ncriminal behavior no longer casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a) and (d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s stellar work \nperformance over the past two years, and her alcohol-abuse treatment and follow-on \nassistance through active participation in AA and counseling. Gaining control over her \nalcohol problem has resulted in disuse of marijuana and drunk driving. Although Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \nhas struggled with her behavior when alcohol is involved, she appears to be on the right \ntrack with help from her substantial support network and counseling. I am convinced that \nApplicant has sincerely changed her behavior, has learned from her past transgressions, \nbenefited from counseling, medication, and the prolonged use of the ignition-interlock \ndevice, and is committed to complete abstinence now and in the future. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guidelines G, H, and J. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 27, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 8, \n2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non January 14, 2019, scheduling the hearing for February 11, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 7, which \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and called one \nwitness, his wife. Applicant offered eight documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AppXs) A through H, and admitted into evidence. The record was left open \n\n \n2 \n \nuntil March 11, 2019, for receipt of additional documentation. On March 11, 2019, \nApplicant offered AppXs I through O, which were also admitted into evidence. \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel also \u201cProposed\u201d four additional exhibits, AppXs J, and P~R, but \nsubmitted nothing further in this regard. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(TR) on February 26, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in the SOR with explanations. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 54 line \n13 to page 60 line 1, and GX 1 at pages 5~6.) He has been employed with the defense \ncontractor since 2003, and has held a security clearance since 2004. (TR at page 54 \nline 13 to page 60 line 1, and GX 1 at pages 15~16.) He is respected in the workplace. \n(AppXs E~G.) \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nAlthough Applicant had some health issues, as attested to by his wife (TR at \npage 23 line 12 to page 25 line 19), they attribute their financial difficulties to an inability \nto handle a sudden abundance of wealth, about $200,000 from his mother-in-law\u2019s trust \nfund. (TR at page 18 line 5 to page 19 line 25, and at page 61 line 6 to page 62 line 2.) \nThey began living beyond their means. (TR at page 61 line 6 to page 62 line 2.)  \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits that he failed to file his state income tax return for tax year \n2014. (GX 3 at page 22.) He has offered nothing further in this regard. This allegation is \nfound against Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. Applicant initially admitted that he failed to pay his state income taxes for tax \nyears 2011~2014. However, the Government has offered evidence that Applicant has a \n\u201c$0.00\u201d balance for tax years 2011 and 2013. (GX 3 at pages 25 and 27.) It also \nappears that Applicant has a payment plan with the state for tax years 2012 and 2014. \n(TR at page 86 line 8 to page 89 line 20, and GX 3 at pages 28~32.) This allegation is \nfound for Applicant. \n \n \n1.c. Applicant initially admitted that he failed to file his Federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2011~2016. However, he has offered evidence that he has now filed his \nFederal tax returns for tax year 2016. (TR at page 65 line 24 to page 66 line 5, and \nAppX B.) As the filings for tax years 2011~2015 still remain outstanding, this allegation \nis found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.d.~1.g. Applicant admits that he owes the Federal government about $38,271 \nin past-due taxes for tax years 2011~2014. (TR at page 95 line 1 to page 96 line 13, \nand Answer at attachments B~E.) Although he averred that he would submit post-\nhearing documentation showing a payment plan with the Internal Revenue Service \n\n \n3 \n \n(IRS) in this regard, Applicant has offered nothing further. These allegations are found \nagainst Applicant. \n \n \n1.h. Applicant initially admitted that he failed to pay his past-due Federal income \ntaxes for tax year 2015. In his Answer, Applicant has offered evidence showing this debt \nhas been paid. (Answer at attachment F.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.i. Applicant admits that he has past-due student loans totaling about $55,818. \nHe has now set up a payment plan by which he will make monthly payments of $332, \nbeginning in February of 2019, towards this admitted past-due debt. (TR at page 76 line \n21 to page 81 line 20.) This is evidenced by documentation submitted by Applicant. \n(AppX I.) I find that Applicant is making a good-faith effort to address his past-due \nstudent loans; and as such, this allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.j. Applicant admits that he has a past-due medical debt for $331, but has \nsubmitted nothing further in this regard. (TR at page 81 line 21 to page 83 line 14.) This \nallegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.k., 1.l and 1.q. Applicant admitted that he had additional past-due medical \ndebts totaling about $126, but has offered documentation that he has successfully \ndisputed these medical debts. (TR at page 81 line 21 to page 83 line 14, and AppXs K \nand L.) These allegations are found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.m. Applicant initially admitted that he had a past-due debt to Creditor M in the \namount of about $242, but has submitted post-hearing documentation that he is \naddressing this debt. (TR at page 83 line 15 to page 84 line 3, and AppX M.) This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.n. Applicant initially admitted that he had a past-due debt to Creditor N in the \namount of about $179, but has submitted post-hearing documentation that he is \naddressing this debt. (TR at page 84 lines 4~12, and AppX N.) This allegation is found \nfor Applicant. \n \n \n1.o. Applicant initially admitted that he had a past-due debt to Creditor O in an \nunspecified amount, but has submitted post-hearing documentation that he is \naddressing this debt. (TR at page 84 line 13 to page 85 line 9, and AppX O.) This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.p. Applicant admits that he has a past-due to Creditor P in the amount of $29, \nbut has submitted nothing further in this regard. (TR at page 85 lines 10~17.) This \nallegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.q. This allegation has been discussed, above. \n \n \n1.r. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt to Creditor R in the amount of \n$763, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. (TR at page 85 line 18 to page 86 \nline 7.) This allegation is found against Applicant. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Five are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant has failed to file both Federal and state income tax returns, has \nsignificant past-due tax debt, and other past-due debts. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n7 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is respected in the workplace. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c~1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h. and 1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j.  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k~1.o: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Lear, Esq., Applicant\u2019s Counsel \n \nJuly 2, 2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision on Reconsideration \n______________ \n \n \nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge: \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 4, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 27, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 8, \n2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non January 14, 2019, scheduling the hearing for February 11, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 7, which \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and called one \nwitness, his wife. Applicant offered eight documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AppXs) A through H, and admitted into evidence. The record was left open \n\n \n2 \n \nuntil March 11, 2019, for receipt of additional documentation. On March 11, 2019, \nApplicant offered AppXs I through O, which were also admitted into evidence. \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel also \u201cProposed\u201d four additional exhibits, AppXs J, and P~R, but \nsubmitted nothing further in this regard. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(TR) on February 26, 2019. \n \nOn May 7, 2019, the undersigned issued a Decision denying Applicant\u2019s access \nto classified information. On May 22, 2019, Applicant submitted a Motion for \nReconsideration (Motion) of the undersigned\u2019s Decision. Appended to that Motion are \nseven post-hearing exhibits (PH Xs) marked as PH Xs A~G. On June 13, 2019, \nDepartment Counsel opposed Applicant\u2019s Motion, averring \u201cthe appropriate remedy was \nto timely appeal the decision to the Appeal Board.\u201d Pursuant to Additional Procedural \nGuidance (APG) E3.1.10, I will consider Applicant\u2019s Motion and PH Xs A~G. Under \nAPG E3.1.10 the undersigned \u201cmay rule on questions on procedure, discovery, and \nevidence and shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely and orderly fashion.\u201d \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in the SOR with explanations. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 54 line \n13 to page 60 line 1, and GX 1 at pages 5~6.) He has been employed with the defense \ncontractor since 2003, and has held a security clearance since 2004. (TR at page 54 \nline 13 to page 60 line 1, and GX 1 at pages 15~16.) He is respected in the workplace. \n(AppXs E~G.) \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nAlthough Applicant had some health issues, as attested to by his wife (TR at \npage 23 line 12 to page 25 line 19), they attribute their financial difficulties to an inability \nto handle a sudden abundance of wealth, about $200,000 from his mother-in-law\u2019s trust \nfund. (TR at page 18 line 5 to page 19 line 25, and at page 61 line 6 to page 62 line 2.) \nThey began living beyond their means. (TR at page 61 line 6 to page 62 line 2.)  \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits that he failed to file his state income tax return for tax year \n2014. (GX 3 at page 22.) He has now offered documentation from his state \ndemonstrating that Applicant has made this filing. This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. Applicant initially admitted that he failed to pay his state income taxes for tax \nyears 2011~2014. However, the Government has offered evidence that Applicant has a \n\u201c$0.00\u201d balance for tax years 2011 and 2013. (GX 3 at pages 25 and 27.) It also \nappears that Applicant has a payment plan with the state for tax years 2012 and 2014. \n(TR at page 86 line 8 to page 89 line 20, and GX 3 at pages 28~32.) This allegation is \nfound for Applicant. (See also PH Xs B and F.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.c. Applicant initially admitted that he failed to file his Federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2011~2016. However, he has offered evidence that he has now filed his \nFederal tax returns for tax year 2016. (TR at page 65 line 24 to page 66 line 5, and \nAppX B.) As to the filings for tax years 2011~2015, Applicant has additionally offered \nPH Xs C and D demonstrating he has also made these filings. This allegation is found \nfor Applicant. \n \n \n1.d.~1.g. Applicant admits that he owes the Federal government about $38,271 \nin past-due taxes for tax years 2011~2014. (TR at page 95 line 1 to page 96 line 13, \nand Answer at attachments B~E.) Applicant has submitted PH Xs showing a payment \nplan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (PH Xs C, E and G.) These allegations \nare found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.h. Applicant initially admitted that he failed to pay his past-due Federal income \ntaxes for tax year 2015. In his Answer, Applicant has offered evidence showing this debt \nhas been paid. (Answer at attachment F.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.i. Applicant admits that he has past-due student loans totaling about $55,818. \nHe has now set up a payment plan by which he will make monthly payments of $332, \nbeginning in February of 2019, towards this admitted past-due debt. (TR at page 76 line \n21 to page 81 line 20.) This is evidenced by documentation submitted by Applicant. \n(AppX I.) I find that Applicant is making a good-faith effort to address his past-due \nstudent loans; and as such, this allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.j. Applicant admits that he has a past-due medical debt for $331, but has \nsubmitted nothing further in this regard. (TR at page 81 line 21 to page 83 line 14.) This \nallegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.k., 1.l and 1.q. Applicant admitted that he had additional past-due medical \ndebts totaling about $126, but has offered documentation that he has successfully \ndisputed these medical debts. (TR at page 81 line 21 to page 83 line 14, and AppXs K \nand L.) These allegations are found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.m. Applicant initially admitted that he had a past-due debt to Creditor M in the \namount of about $242, but has submitted post-hearing documentation that he is \naddressing this debt. (TR at page 83 line 15 to page 84 line 3, and AppX M.) This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.n. Applicant initially admitted that he had a past-due debt to Creditor N in the \namount of about $179, but has submitted post-hearing documentation that he is \naddressing this debt. (TR at page 84 lines 4~12, and AppX N.) This allegation is found \nfor Applicant. \n \n \n1.o. Applicant initially admitted that he had a past-due debt to Creditor O in an \nunspecified amount, but has submitted post-hearing documentation that he is \naddressing this debt. (TR at page 84 line 13 to page 85 line 9, and AppX O.) This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n1.p. Applicant admits that he has a past-due to Creditor P in the amount of $29, \nbut has submitted nothing further in this regard. (TR at page 85 lines 10~17.) This \nallegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.q. This allegation has been discussed, above. \n \n \n1.r. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt to Creditor R in the amount of \n$763, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. (TR at page 85 line 18 to page 86 \nline 7.) This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nPolicies \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n5 \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Five are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n  \nApplicant had failed to file both Federal and state income tax returns, had \nsignificant past-due tax debt, and had other past-due debts. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. Applicant has yet to address a medical debt, and two other past-due \ndebts. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is respected in the workplace. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a~i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.j.  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k~1.o: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a service technician with his current employer since October 2016. A 1997 high school graduate, Applicant received an associate\u2019s degree in 2011. He never served with the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant was married in October 1999, and separated in June 2011. He has been cohabiting since July 2014. He has two children, born in 1999 and 2009. Financial Considerations1 During his enhanced subject interview conducted by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in September 2017, Applicant attributed his financial issues to his separation from his spouse after he found out about her infidelity; child support payments; and several periods of unemployment. He had previously reported in his e-QIP that he had been unemployed from July 2009 until June 2010; from December 2010 until March 2011; from June 2011 until September 2011; and from 1 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (e-QI",

Connelley, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 31, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On January 22, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a set of interrogatories. He \nresponded to those interrogatories on February 19, 2018. On April 18, 2018, the DOD \nCAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), (December 10, 2016), National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or \ncontinued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive \nposition, effective June 8, 2017.  \n12/17/2018\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIt is unclear as to when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the \ncase file. In a sworn statement, dated June 11, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on August 2, 2018, and he was afforded \nan opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as \nwell as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM \non August 8, 2018. Applicant\u2019s response was due on September 22, 2018. Applicant \napparently chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of December 14, 2018, he has not \ndone so. The case was assigned to me on December 13, 2018.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments all of the factual \nallegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.i.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a service technician with his current employer since October 2016. A 1997 high school \ngraduate, Applicant received an associate\u2019s degree in 2011. He never served with the \nU.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant was married in October \n1999, and separated in June 2011. He has been cohabiting since July 2014. He has two \nchildren, born in 1999 and 2009. \n \nFinancial Considerations1 \n \nDuring his enhanced subject interview conducted by an investigator from the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) in September 2017, Applicant attributed his \nfinancial issues to his separation from his spouse after he found out about her infidelity; \nchild support payments; and several periods of unemployment. He had previously \nreported in his e-QIP that he had been unemployed from July 2009 until June 2010; from \nDecember 2010 until March 2011; from June 2011 until September 2011; and from \n                                                          \n1 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: Item 2 (e-QIP, dated March 31, 2017); Item 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated \nSeptember 28, 2017); Item 6 (Answers to Interrogatories, dated February 19, 2018); Item 4 (Combined \nExperian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated May 18, 2017); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, \ndated December 20, 2017); Item 1 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated June 11, 2018).  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nDecember 2011 until August 2012. During his periods of unemployment, Applicant was \nsupported financially by unemployment compensation, his father, or by his personal \nsavings, and he spent his time hunting for a job, doing chores on the family farm, or \nattending school.2 Those combined factors made it difficult for him to remain current on \nhis bills and child support, and some accounts became delinquent, and he developed a \nchild support arrearage. The arrearage was resolved in August 2013 when the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) applied his tax refund to the debt, and he borrowed $3,000 from \nhis family to make the final payment.3 \nThe SOR identified nine delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection \nor charged off as generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s May 2017 or December 2017 credit \nreports. Applicant claimed that some of the accounts may have been generated by his \nwife, or because she broke their informal agreement that he would work to earn the \nmoney, and she would stay home and pay the bills.4 He acknowledged that he has not \nentered into any agreements or made any payments to the creditors, although he said in \nhis Answer to the SOR that he hoped to start doing so by July 2018.5 Those debts, totaling \napproximately $38,625, are described below: \n There are seven delinquent student loans (SOR \u00b6 1.a., for $7,745); (SOR \u00b6 1.b., \nfor $6,863); (SOR \u00b6 1.c., for $6,646); (SOR \u00b6 1.d., for $4,938); (SOR \u00b6 1.e., for $4,306); \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f., for $3,277); and (SOR \u00b6 1.h., for $3,211), that remain unresolved, with no \nevidence of any efforts by Applicant to either contact the creditor(s), enter into  repayment \narrangements, or make even small periodic payments. There are also a satellite television \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.g., for $401), and a cellular telephone account (SOR \u00b6 1.i., for $1,238), \nthat remain unresolved, although Applicant previously indicated the former would be paid \noff by July 2018, and the latter would be paid off by November 2018.6  \nApplicant failed to indicate his monthly net pay, monthly expenses, debt payments, \nor if he has any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or \nsavings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. \nApplicant offered no evidence to indicate that his financial situation has improved, or that \nit is now under control.  \n                                                          \n2 Item 3, supra note 1, at 5-7. \n \n3 Item 3, supra note 1, at 10. \n \n4 Item 3, supra note 1, at 10. \n \n5 Item 1, supra note 1; Item 6, supra note 1. \n6 It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts \nin the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting \nin a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d7 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d8   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d9 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.10  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n                                                          \n7 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n8 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n9 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate \nto support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. \nBd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less \nthan a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n10 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d11  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d12 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n                                                          \n11 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n12 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant had nine delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection or \ncharged off. Although he was questioned about those delinquent accounts in September \n2017, to date, he has not made any efforts to address them. He acknowledged having an \ninability to meet his financial obligations over a period of years since 2011. It is unclear if \nhis avoidance of his financial obligations is associated with an unwillingness to satisfy his \ndebts or merely an inability to do so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but \nAG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;13 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;14 and \n                                                          \n13 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \n14 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the remaining mitigating conditions \napply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties \nmake it difficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it \nis \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to his separation from his \nspouse; child support payments; and several periods of unemployment. However, during \nhis periods of unemployment, Applicant was supported financially by unemployment \ncompensation, his father, or by his personal savings. He also claimed to have insufficient \nfunds to maintain his financial responsibilities.  \nThere is no documentation to reflect that Applicant made any efforts, much less \n\u201cgood-faith\u201d efforts, before or after he was interviewed by OPM in September 2017; before \nor after the SOR was issued in April 2018; or even after he was sent the FORM in August \n2018, to: obtain financial counseling from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-\nprofit credit counseling service; dispute his delinquent accounts with the credit reporting \nagencies or the creditors themselves; contact his creditors to set up repayment plans; or \nindicate that payments had been made to his creditors.15 An applicant who begins to \nresolve his financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her security \nclearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules \nand regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own \ninterests.16 In this instance, to date, there is no evidence that any corrective actions have \nbeen taken by Applicant. There is no evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s finances are \nunder control. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \n                                                          \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.17  \n  \nThere is very little evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 39-year-\nold employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a service technician with \nhis current employer since October 2016.  \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant has nine delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection or charged off, \ntotaling $38,625. He has made no efforts to resolve them. Applicant has not obtained \nfinancial counseling. There is no evidence of a budget, and he offered no evidence to \nindicate that his financial situation has improved, or that it is now under control. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:18 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \n                                                          \n17 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n18 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor, if not non-existent, track record of \ndebt reduction and elimination efforts, seemingly avoiding the debts in his name. Overall, \nthe evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant is a 50-year-old foreman and has worked for a defense contractor since November 1999. He holds a confidential clearance, which is required for him to perform his job. From September 1987 through September 1990, he honorably served in the U.S. Army. (Item 2) His rank while serving is not contained in the record. In April 2004, he married his wife. He had previously been married from December 1989 through July 1993. (Item 2) His son, who lives with him, is 17 years old and he has two adult step-children. (Item 3) The record does not reveal if his wife is currently working, what her income is if working, his income, the amount of the household\u2019s income, or what their monthly expenses are. In 2012, Applicant purchased a truck with monthly loan payments of $520. In 2014, the truck was repossessed when his payments were three months delinquent. He became delinquent on his payments when his adult step-children moved in with him, and he started paying their bills. Following the repossession, a $12,710 (SOR 1.a) debt resulted. (Item 3) The debt has been transferred from the original creditor to a collection agency. (Item 3) As of October 2017, he had not made any payments on the debt because he asserts he has 4 not been contacted by the original creditor since the repossession.

The \nobligations remain unpaid. He provided no documentation showing any efforts to address \nthe past-due debts. He provided false answers on his January 20, 2016 Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). He failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct, \nexplaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue security clearance eligibility for him. The DoD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \n01/29/2019\n\n2 \n \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, for all adjudications for \nnational security eligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n \nOn April 4, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision on the written record by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). On May 30, 2018, the Government submitted a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), consisting of six exhibits (Items 1-6). DOHA forwarded a copy \nof the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. On July \n2, 2018, Applicant\u2019s response was received. There being no objection to the response, it \nwas admitted as Item A. On October 26, 2018, I was assigned the case to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant.  \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 3 a summary of a personal subject interview \n(PSI) of Applicant conducted on April 4, 2017. The summary was part of the DoD Report of \nInvestigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DoD personnel \nbackground report of investigation may be received in evidence and considered with an \nauthenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of \nEvidence. The interview summary did not bear the authentication required for admissibility \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her \nopportunity to object to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; \nand there is no indication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, \nApplicant was provided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit \nobjections or material that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In a footnote, \nthe FORM advised Applicant of the following: \n \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interview (PSI) is being provided to the Administrative \nJudge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this case. In your \nresponse to this File of Relevant Material (FORM), you can comment on \nwhether the PSI summary accurately reflects the information you provided to \nthe authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the summary clear and \naccurate. Alternatively, you can object on the ground that the report is \nunauthenticated by a Government witness. If no objections are raised in your \nresponse to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, the \nAdministrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections to \nthe admissibility of the summary and may consider the summary as evidence \nin your case. \n \n\n3 \n \n \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. He was \nadvised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was \nadvised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not \nspecifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on \nsufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of the interview summary, to \ncomment on the interview summary, and to make any corrections, deletions, or updates to \nthe information in the report. Applicant is a college graduate, who can reasonably be held \nto have understood the footnote, and he did not object to the PSI or indicate that it \ncontained inaccurate information. Accordingly, I accepted Item 3 in the record, subject to \nissues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that, as of January 3, 2018, Applicant had an unsatisfied \njudgement and six delinquent obligations which together totaled $15,649. In his answer to \nthe SOR, he admitted the delinquent obligations listed in SOR 1.a ($12,710) and SOR 1.b \n($305), but disputed the amounts owed. He denied the remaining allegations. His SOR \nresponse provided no explanation about the delinquent accounts. He denied falsifying his \nJanuary 20, 2016 e-QIP stating he had not reviewed his credit report prior to completing his \ne-QIP because he does not use credit.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the FORM, Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, and his response \nto the SOR (Item 1), I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old foreman and has worked for a defense contractor since \nNovember 1999. He holds a confidential clearance, which is required for him to perform his \njob. From September 1987 through September 1990, he honorably served in the U.S. \nArmy. (Item 2) His rank while serving is not contained in the record. In April 2004, he \nmarried his wife. He had previously been married from December 1989 through July 1993. \n(Item 2) His son, who lives with him, is 17 years old and he has two adult step-children. \n(Item 3) The record does not reveal if his wife is currently working, what her income is if \nworking, his income, the amount of the household\u2019s income, or what their monthly \nexpenses are.  \n \n \nIn 2012, Applicant purchased a truck with monthly loan payments of $520. In 2014, \nthe truck was repossessed when his payments were three months delinquent. He became \ndelinquent on his payments when his adult step-children moved in with him, and he started \npaying their bills. Following the repossession, a $12,710 (SOR 1.a) debt resulted. (Item 3) \nThe debt has been transferred from the original creditor to a collection agency. (Item 3) As \nof October 2017, he had not made any payments on the debt because he asserts he has \n\n4 \n \nnot been contacted by the original creditor since the repossession. (Item 3) In his PSI, he \nindicated he intended to satisfy this debt, but did not provide a date for doing so. (Item 3) \nThis delinquent obligation appears on his February 2016, January 2018, and July 2018 \ncredit reports. (Item 4, Item 5, Item A) \n \n \nApplicant, in his January 20, 2016 e-QIP, failed to list the 2014 repossession even \nthough Section 26 specifically asked him to list any repossession that occurred in the \nprevious seven years. (Item 2) He stated he did not list the debt on his e-QIP due to an \noversight.  \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s PSI, he indicated the $61 medical collection debt (SOR 1.g) may \nhave been his copayment on one of his children\u2019s medical bill. He intended to look into the \naccount and satisfy it at some future date. (Item 2) He believes the $176 collection account \n(SOR 1.f) was the final bill for his cable service. He intended to satisfy the debt at some \nfuture date. He had no knowledge about the $305 cable collection debt (SOR 1.b). This \ndelinquent obligation appears on his February 2016, January 2018, and July 2018 credit \nreports. (Item 4, Item 5, Item A) He incurred a $1,026 delinquent obligation (SOR 1.d) on a \nrental agreement that was charged off in January 2014. (Item 4) He had a $388 credit card \ndebt (SOR 1.e) charged off in August 2009. (Item 4)  \n \n \nDuring the November December 2008 time period, Applicant became behind on his \n$800 monthly rent when his wife lost her job. (Item 3) He answered \u201cno\u201d on the question on \nhis e-QIP that asked if during the previous seven years he had been evicted for non-\npayment of rent. The record is insufficient to show that an eviction occurred only that he \nbecame delinquent on his rent payments. Based on the amount owed the landlord, he was \nmore than six months behind on his rent. In February 2009, the landlord obtained $5,231 \njudgement against Applicant. (Items 3 and 6) A garnishment of $450 to $500 every two \nweeks was obtained against Applicant. (Item 3) As of July 2010, $4,536 was yet owed on \nthe $5,231 garnishment. (Item 6) As of October 2010, $2,990 was yet owed on a $3,331 \ngarnishment. It is not clear from the record if these garnishments were the same obligation. \nIn March 2003, a garnishment of $2,919 was obtained by a different creditor. In February \n2012, another creditor obtained a garnishment of $1,998. (Item 6) In November 2013, a \njudgment action was filed against Applicant in the amount of $983 (SOR 1.c). (Item 4) The \njudgment remains unsatisfied. In his SOR response, he asserted he did not list his \ngarnishments on his e-QIP because he asserts the garnishments had occurred before \n2010. (Item 1) He provided no documentation supporting the garnishments occurred prior \n2010, which was the seven-year period of concern in the e-QIP.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed his January 20, 2016 e-QIP, he answered \u201cno\u201d when \nasked if during the past seven years he had any property repossessed, had his wages \ngarnished, had bills turned over to a collection agency, had accounts charged off, \nsuspended or canceled, or had ever been more than 120 days delinquent on any debt. He \nhad had accounts turned over for collection, other accounts that had been charged off, and \nother accounts that were more than 120 days delinquent. Additionally, he answered \u201cno\u201d \nwhen asked if a judgment had been entered against him during the previous seven years. \nThe November 2013 judgment had been entered against him only three years earlier. He \n\n5 \n \nalso answered \u201cno\u201d when asked about his wages being garnished during the previous \nseven years even though garnishment actions had been entered against him in March \n2010, July 2010, October 2010, and February 2012. (Item 6)  \n \n \nApplicant in his July 2018 SOR response, he denied falsifying his e-QIP or any other \ndocument. (Item A) Included with his SOR response were copies of his July 2018 credit \nreports. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \n\n6 \n \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by \nknown sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result \nfrom criminal activity, including espionage. \n \n \nApplicant is not required to be debt free, but he is require to manage his finances in \na way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The concern under Guideline F is \nbroader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise classified \ninformation in order to raise money to address debts. It encompasses concerns about an \nindividual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. \n \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established by Applicant\u2019s unpaid judgment and \nsix delinquent obligations totaling $15,649. Disqualifying conditions 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply. In October 2017, during his subject interview, Applicant indicated he \nintended to pay some of these obligations, but provided no anticipated date for payment. \nThere is no documentation that the past-due debts have been paid.  \n \n \nFinancial delinquencies are potentially mitigated under one or more of the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n7 \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because there are numerous unpaid obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to take any steps to repay the debt following the repossession of his \ntruck, his cable account debt, and other credit card accounts continues to cast doubts on \nhis judgment and reliability.  \n \n \nApplicant asserted his rental debt was due to his wife losing her job, which would be \na factor largely beyond the person\u2019s control. However, he failed to explain when this \noccurred or how it impacted on the household finances. Also his adult children moved in \nwith him and he started paying their bills. Adult children living with him and his decision to \npay their debts is not a factor beyond his control. There is no indication that he \ncommunicated with his creditors or attempted to repay any of the debts. There is no \ndocumented payments of even the smaller debts of the $61 medical debt or the $176 cable \nbill. For AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply he must have acted responsibly under the circumstances \nand there is no evidence he has done so.  \n \n \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) is established without some effort on his part to \naddress the debts. There is no evidence of financial counseling or evidence of him having \nmade any payments on SOR delinquent obligations. Some of his delinquent debt has been \ncharged off by the creditors. A creditor charge-off is an account transfer made when a \ncreditor no longer expects to be repaid. Debts may continue to be legally enforceable even \nafter they are charged off.  \n \n \n \nAppeal Board precedent requires that \u201ca person acts in such a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d1 In the past, \n                                                 \n1 The DOHA Appeal Board stated in ISCR Case No. 07-06482, decided on May 21, 2008, in part: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the concept of \n\u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \npayment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). \nHowever, an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off \n\n8 \n \nsome of his financial delinquent obligations not listed in the SOR have been paid through \ngarnishment. However, a garnishment does not constitute a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to pay his \ndebts. Payment of a debt \u201cthough garnishment rather than a voluntary effort diminishes its \nmitigating force.2 Satisfaction of a debt through the involuntary establishment of a \ncreditor\u2019s garnishment is not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment \nby the debtor.  \n \n \nApplicant denied some of the SOR delinquent obligations, but for the mitigation of \nAG \u00b6 20(e) to be established he must provide documented proof to substantiate the basis \nof the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. The only documents he \nprovided were copies of his credit reports. The copies of the credit reports do not \nsubstantiate the basis of his denials of the debts. Concerns persist about his financial \njudgment. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe concerns about personal conduct are articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct, of special \ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance \nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant\u2019s concealment of relevant and material information demonstrates a lack of \ncandor required of cleared personnel. The Government has an interest in examining all \nrelevant and material adverse information about an applicant before making a clearance \ndecision. The Government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse \ninformation in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived to be prudent or convenient. \nFurther, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about himself provides \nsome indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other security \nconcerns in the future, something the government relies on to perform damage \nassessments and limit the compromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s conduct \nsuggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interest.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate[s] that he has \u201c. . . \nestablished a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). \n \n2 Compare ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (payment of two of four debts through garnishment did not bar mitigation of financial \nconsiderations concerns). \n\n9 \n \n \nOf primary concern in this case is Applicant\u2019s demonstrated lack of trustworthiness \nin deliberately concealing his repossession, garnishments, charged-off accounts, accounts \nturned over for collection, and accounts more than 120 delinquent when he completed his \nJanuary 20, 2016 e-QIP. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to his falsification, as follows:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed his January 20, 2016 e-QIP he answered \u201cno\u201d when \nasked if during the previous seven years he had any property repossessed, had his wages \ngarnished, had bills turned over to a collection agency, had accounts charged off, \nsuspended or canceled, or had ever been more than 120 days delinquent on any debt. \nWhen he completed the e-QIP he had accounts that had been charged off, turned over for \ncollection, were more than 120 delinquent. He had four garnishments during the previous \nseven years. In 2014, within two years of him completing his e-QIP, his truck was \nrepossessed. \n \n \nApplicant indicated he did not use credit and had not checked his credit report \nbefore completing his e-QIP. This explanation may explain why he did not list some of his \ncharged-off and collection accounts. However, it does not explain why he failed to list the \nrepossession and garnishment actions. One may forget about a past due debt, but his \nclaims of a lack of memory are not credible when one day he was driving his truck and the \nnext day it was gone because it was repossessed. It is also difficult to forget that every two \nweeks $450 to $500 was being garnished from his wages. At a minimum, he should have \nrevealed the repossession and garnishments on his e-QIP.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors apply. AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-\nfaith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted \nwith the facts,\u201d does not apply. The omissions or concealments were not caused by legal \nadvice or by advice from another, AG \u00b6 17(b). AG \u00b6 17(c) provides: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nFalsifying a security questionnaire is not minor, it occurred three years ago, it did not \nhappen under unique circumstances, and it does cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. The mitigating conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d), 17(e), 17(f), and 17 (g) do not apply. Applicant exercised \u201cquestionable \njudgment\u201d within the general security concerns set forth in AG \u00b6 15 when he failed to give \ntruthful answer on his e-QIP. \n \n\n10 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication is not aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s \npersonal debts. Rather, it involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). At the same time, Applicant has the burden of presenting \nevidence of relevant facts and circumstances to show why he should be granted security \nclearance eligibility notwithstanding the delinquent debt information on his credit record. By \ncontinuing to ignore evidence of a financial judgment, Applicant places in doubt whether he \ncan be trusted to comply with rules and regulations regarding the handling and \nsafeguarding of classified information. \n \nApplicant has been aware of the Government\u2019s security concern about his \ndelinquent obligations since his January 20, 2016 interview when he was specifically \nconfronted about his delinquent obligations. Additionally, the March 2018 SOR and May \n2018 FORM put him on notice of the Government\u2019s concern about the delinquent \nobligations. The FORM specifically informed him there was little evidence that payment \nhad been made on the collection or the charged-off accounts. Since his October 2017 \ninterview, he has failed to provide documentation showing payment of even the smallest of \nhis delinquent accounts of $61 and $175. When questioned about his finances on his e-\nQIP, at a minimum, he should have remembered and revealed his truck repossession and \nhis wage garnishments. \n \nIn requesting a decision without a hearing, Applicant chose to rely on the written \nrecord. In so doing, however, he failed to submit sufficient information or evidence to \nsupplement the record with relevant and material facts regarding his circumstances, \narticulate his position, and mitigate the financial security concerns. He failed to offer \nevidence of financial counseling or provide documentation regarding his past efforts to \naddress the delinquent debt. By failing to provide such information, and in relying on only \nthe limited response in his SOR Answer, financial considerations and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns remain.  \n \n \n \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid\u2014it is \nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(c)) He has not documented payment on his delinquent obligations \nnor provided an explanation that mitigates his false answers on his January 20, 2016 e-\nQIP.  \n \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \n\n11 \n \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Based on the evidence before me, I am unable to \nconclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance \neligibility for Applicant. Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations and \npersonal conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nClaude R. Heiny \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted both of the SOR allegations. She is 48 years old. She was born in Guyana. She immigrated to the United States in 1974 and became a U.S. citizen in 1985. She married in 2001. She has two children, one adult and one minor, and an adult stepchild. She has owned her home since 2001. (Tr. at 21-22, 77, 81, 123-124, 125-136; GE 1; AE M). Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1992 and a master\u2019s degree in 1993. She has worked for various U.S. Government contractors since approximately 1997. She was unemployed after the birth of her child from May to December 2007, and she was briefly unemployed in November 2015 and January 2017. As of the date of the hearing, she worked as a program analyst for her employer, a Department of State (DOS) contractor, since February 2017. She was first granted a security clearance in 1996. (Tr. at 6, 17-21, 62-63, 85-90, 100-101, 136-148; GE 1; AE T). The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2016, as required (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleges that she was delinquently indebted to the state tax authority for $6,230 in state income taxes for tax years 2012 and 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). She listed her failure to timely file and pay her federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2016 and her state income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2016 on her April 2017 security clearance application (SCA).

Williams, Esq., Department Counsel,  \nBenjamin Dorsey, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Nina Ren, Esq. \n08/30/2019 \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 26, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 13, 2018 and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 12, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing (NOH) \non September 24, 2018, scheduling the hearing for November 1, 2018. With no \n\n \n2 \n \nobjection, I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a hearing continuance to provide her with the \nopportunity to obtain counsel. DOHA issued a second NOH on December 17, 2018, \nrescheduling the hearing for January 17, 2019. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. \n \nI admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, called three witnesses, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough Y, which I admitted in evidence without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, and \nwith no objection from the Government, I left the record open until March 18, 2019. With \nno objection, I granted Applicant\u2019s March 14, 2019, request for an extension of time until \nApril 17, 2019 to submit additional documentation. Applicant timely provided additional \nevidence, which I collectively marked as AE Z and admitted in evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 28, 2019.  \n                                                                                                                                                        \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted both of the SOR allegations. She is 48 years old. She was \nborn in Guyana. She immigrated to the United States in 1974 and became a U.S. citizen \nin 1985. She married in 2001. She has two children, one adult and one minor, and an \nadult stepchild. She has owned her home since 2001. (Tr. at 21-22, 77, 81, 123-124, \n125-136; GE 1; AE M). \n \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1992 and a master\u2019s degree in 1993. \nShe has worked for various U.S. Government contractors since approximately 1997. \nShe was unemployed after the birth of her child from May to December 2007, and she \nwas briefly unemployed in November 2015 and January 2017. As of the date of the \nhearing, she worked as a program analyst for her employer, a Department of State \n(DOS) contractor, since February 2017. She was first granted a security clearance in \n1996. (Tr. at 6, 17-21, 62-63, 85-90, 100-101, 136-148; GE 1; AE T). \n \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2012 through 2016, as required (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleges that she was \ndelinquently indebted to the state tax authority for $6,230 in state income taxes for tax \nyears 2012 and 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). She listed her failure to timely file and pay her \nfederal income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2016 and her state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2014 through 2016 on her April 2017 security clearance application \n(SCA). She also listed her failure to timely file her state income tax returns for tax years \n2012 and 2013 on her 2017 SCA, stating that the state tax authority filed on her behalf \nas a result. December 2017 IRS account transcripts reflect that Applicant did not timely \nfile her federal income tax returns for tax periods 2012 through 2016, and though she \nwas given extensions until October 2013, October 2014, and October 2015 for tax \nperiods 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively, she failed to file the relevant tax returns by \nthe extension deadlines. (Tr. at 26-28, 90-91; GE 1, 2; AE B, C). \n \n \nApplicant attributes her untimely filing of her relevant federal and state income \ntax returns and her delinquent state taxes to unforeseen circumstances that began in \n2013, when her husband was fired from his job. His employer of approximately 19 years \nlost its contract to a new company that required her husband to provide proof of a \n\n \n3 \n \nbachelor\u2019s degree for continued employment. He had misled both her and his previous \nemployer to believe that he had such a degree. She unsuccessfully attempted, from \nJanuary to March 2013, to prevent her husband from losing his job as he was only a few \nclasses short and had worked in his field for nearly 20 years. Their household income \ndropped from $200,000 to $90,000, and he was unemployed from about March to \nAugust 2013 and April 2014 to April 2015. (Tr. at 26-27, 35-75, 91-101, 120-121, 125-\n136; GE 1). \n \n \nDuring this period, Applicant also assisted her stepson with paying an \nindeterminate amount in legal fees for his then-pending criminal charges. She incurred \nthe additional expense of housing both her stepson, after his apartment eviction, and his \nmother, after her incarceration release, when she temporarily permitted them to reside \nin her home until they became self-sufficient. (Tr. at 26-27, 35-75, 91-101, 120-121, \n125-136; GE 1; AE N).  \n \n \nFrom approximately late 2013 to November 2014, Applicant faced issues with \nher then-employer of nearly seven years, which in turn affected her health. She also \nexperienced issues involving her children from 2014 through 2018, to include three \nincidents in which one child was assaulted by school bullies and led to her pursuit of \ncriminal charges against the assailants, and behavioral incidents for her other child that \nled to an ADHD diagnosis and the implementation of a reasonable accommodation plan \nat that child\u2019s school. She testified that she notified both the IRS and the state tax \nauthority about her circumstances that impeded her ability to timely file her income tax \nreturns and of her intention to eventually file them. (Tr. at 26-27, 35-75, 91-101, 125-\n136, 148-155; GE 1; AE O, P, Q, R, S).  \n \n \nApplicant testified that at different times during this period: \n \nWhen I would try to sit down at different times, I would try to work on my \ntaxes, the weight of everything and knowing the importance of getting the \ntaxes done, but knowing everything that I had to look through and all of \nthe paperwork, it just was making me get -- I would start getting really \nanxious. And I couldn\u2019t really, like, be still to do what I needed to do, even \nthough I knew I needed to do it. And I was getting, like, really, most of the \ntimes, a lot of the times, these crying spells. I would have, like, when I felt \nreally overwhelmed, I\u2019d just go off somewhere and just really be crying . . . \nI kind of feel like I was fighting depression, but I never really went to a \ndoctor or anything like that, to get diagnosed with depression. \n \n(Tr. at 73). \n \n \nWhile Applicant asked her husband for help, his efforts were also stymied by his \nstruggle, then, with depression. Though she understood she had a legal obligation to file \nher tax returns, she did not prioritize doing so, in part because of her perception that \nshe did not believe she would owe any taxes and she was \u201cbasically holding up my own \nrefund.\u201d She also testified that she did not think about the impact that failing to file her \ntax returns would have on her security clearance. In her SCA, she listed that she \n\n \n4 \n \ntraveled for pleasure to the Bahamas in December 2014 and to the Dominican Republic \nin November 2015. (Tr. at 73, 93-120, 125-136; GE 1). \n \n \nApplicant filed her 2012 through 2017 state and federal income tax returns in \nJanuary 2019. She hired a tax advisor in February 2018 to assist her, though she \npersonally sorted through \u201cseven to ten boxes\u201d of paperwork to support the exemptions \nand deductions that both she and her husband claimed for their home office. She \nacknowledged that her 2017 SCA prompted her to file her relevant tax returns. (Tr. at \n22-35, 68, 93-120; GE 1; AE A-F, H, J, V, W, X, Z). \n \n \nIRS account transcripts from March 2019 reflect that she has a zero balance for \ntax periods 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. An April 2019 letter from the IRS reflects \nreceipt of her federal income tax return for tax year 2014, but necessary documentation \nthat was missing needed to be received before her return was processed.  (Tr. at 22-35, \n68, 93-120; GE 1; AE A-E, H, V, W, Z). \n \n \nApplicant testified that when the state tax authority filed her 2012 and 2013 state \nincome tax returns on her behalf in 2016, after she had failed to timely file them, the tax \nauthority gave her the option of paying her outstanding state taxes of approximately \n$8,000 to $9,000 in full or through a payment plan. She elected the payment plan and \nbegan payments accordingly in December 2016. In approximately late 2018, the state \ntax authority notified her that it had also filed her 2014 and 2015 state income tax \nreturns on her behalf after she failed to timely file them and tacked on her outstanding \nstate taxes for these tax years to her existing payment plan. (Tr. at 22-35, 68, 93-120; \nGE 3; AE D, F, G, I, J, W, Y, Z). \n \n \nA January 2018 state tax authority record reflects that Applicant\u2019s outstanding \nbalance for tax years 2012 and 2013 was $6,230; she established a monthly payment \nplan in July 2017 of $235 for 36 months; her first installment was due in August 2017; \nand she was in good standing. January 2019 records from the state tax authority reflect \nthat Applicant has no outstanding state tax income liability after her filed returns for tax \nyears 2012 through 2017 were processed. The records state that such a determination \ncould be subject to change if the IRS made any adjustments that would, in turn, \nnecessitate adjustments to her state income tax returns. (Tr. at 22-35, 68, 93-120; GE \n3; AE D, F, G, I, J, W, Y, Z). \n \n \nApplicant received an extension of time to file her 2018 federal and state income \ntax returns and she filed them on April 17, 2019. She testified that prior to tax year \n2012, she timely filed all of her federal and state income tax returns. She described her \ncurrent financial health as \u201cpretty good.\u201d She stated that her husband recently changed \nemployers in October 2018, but he previously worked for the same employer since \n2015, and his salary was approaching the amount he earned prior to 2013; he was also \ncompleting his courses towards his bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2019. She also stated that \ntheir household annual salary was approximately $200,000, they have $6,200 in \nsavings, $140,000 in equity in their home, and they intend to resume setting aside \nmoney in their 401(k) retirement accounts. They do not have any other delinquent \n\n \n5 \n \ndebts. They have not sought financial counseling, but they received tax assistance from \ntheir tax advisor. (Tr. at 71, 75-85, 121-136; AE K, L, M, Z). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s U.S. Government supervisor from January 2017 to the date of the \nhearing testified that he interacted with her daily. He testified that she told him about her \ntax issues in late 2018 and he considered them a \u201cblip within her career.\u201d He described \nher as a straightforward, astute, and trustworthy individual who observes rules and \nexercises good judgment. He testified that \u201cshe really keeps us between the lines on \nfinancial issues\u201d and adheres to government finance regulations. He has provided input \nto her contract supervisor that he considers her an excellent employee. (Tr. at 136-148). \n \n \nA friend, who previously worked with Applicant from 2012 to 2014, testified that \nshe was aware of the issues Applicant faced with their previous employer, and her \naccompanying health issues. The witness also testified that she was aware of \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues. She described Applicant as a dedicated worker and a reliable, \nlaw abiding individual with sound judgment. This witness testified that she was aware of \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues. (Tr. at 148-155). \n \n \nApplicant was selected as \u201cStaff of the Month\u201d in 2009 for her outstanding work. \nHer performance appraisals from 2010 through 2014 reflect that she was a highly- \nregarded employee. She received a commendation in 2016 from an employer for whom \nshe was on a one-year contract. Her employer noted in her 2017 to 2018 performance \nreview that she has continued to demonstrate exemplary work performance. (Tr. at 59-\n63; AE T, U). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 \nthrough 2016, as required. She failed to timely file her state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2012 and 2013, as required, and consequently owed approximately $6,230 in \nback taxes. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f) as disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant hired a tax advisor in February 2018 to assist her with filing her 2012 \nthrough 2016 federal and state income tax returns and resolve her outstanding 2012 \nand 2013 state tax liability. She filed her relevant tax returns in January 2019. She is \nworking on completing her 2014 federal income tax return by providing the IRS with the \nnecessary missing documentation. In filing her relevant tax returns, she resolved any \npreviously outstanding state tax liability for tax years 2012 and 2013. She demonstrated \nthat she also filed her federal and state income tax returns for 2017 in January 2019 \nand she filed her federal and state income tax returns for 2018 by the extension \ndeadline. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) are established. \n \nIt is well established that failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has difficulty with abiding by government rules and regulations. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). It is also well established that \nthe mere filing of past-due returns or resolution of delinquent tax debts does not compel \na favorable security-clearance adjudication. ISCR Case No. 17-01907 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, \n\n \n8 \n \n2018). The timing of corrective action is an important factor in determining whether \nsecurity concerns raised by tax delinquencies are mitigated. Applicants who wait until \ntheir clearances are in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment \nexpected of those with access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. \nBd. May 30, 2018). \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file her 2012 through 2016 federal income tax returns and \ntimely pay her state income taxes for tax years 2012 and 2013. Thus, the first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence \nthat she acted responsibly under her circumstances. She did not hire a tax advisor to \nassist her with filing her relevant delinquent tax returns until February 2018, after she \ncompleted her 2017 SCA, and she did not file her delinquent tax returns until January \n2019. Only then did the state tax authority determine that she does not have any \noutstanding tax liability. Prior to that, though she made payments on her state income \ntaxes for tax years 2012 and 2013, she only did so in December 2016, after the state \ntax authority notified her that it had filed her state income tax returns on her behalf, \nbecause she had failed to timely do so and gave her the option of payment in full or a \npayment plan. As such, AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file her 2012 through 2016 federal income tax returns \nand timely resolve her previously delinquent state taxes for tax years 2012 and 2013. I \nfind that such behavior did not happen so long ago, was not infrequent, and did not \noccur under such circumstances that are unlikely to recur. It continues to cast doubt on \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n\n \n9 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Her job title is security officer, and she does not currently possess a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 20-21; GE 1) Financial Considerations Applicant encountered financial issues when she became pregnant with her son in 2015. She was underemployed at the time, and she did not have adequate health insurance coverage. She required medical care throughout the pregnancy due to serious medical complications. Immediately after her son\u2019s birth, her son also required medical care. She did not make sufficient income to pay for the medical bills, as she was making just enough to pay her monthly expenses. She applied for Medicare twice, but she was denied both times. Her medical bills were referred for collection. (Tr. 20-23; AE B; SOR Response) The SOR alleges 16 delinquent debts totaling $42,683.

She made significant progress resolving her delinquent debts and is \nclearly committed to repaying all of her outstanding medical accounts. Her finances are \nunder control, and future financial problems are unlikely to recur. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted.            \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 5, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). On \nAugust 31, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nOn September 14, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, attached five pages of \nsupporting documentation, and requested a hearing. On February 28, 2019, the case \nwas assigned to me. On March 5, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for March 20, 2019. Applicant\u2019s \nhearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits, Government \nExhibits (GE) 1-3, and Applicant offered four exhibits, Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-D. There \nwere no objections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. On April 1, \n2019, DOHA received the hearing transcript. Applicant timely submitted a monthly \nbudget, (AE E), and the record closed on April 22, 2019.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. She denied owing the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.p, claiming these debts had been paid. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 36 years old. She is married and has one child, age three. She \ngraduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004. She started working for her current employer \nin June 2017. Her job title is security officer, and she does not currently possess a DOD \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 20-21; GE 1) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant encountered financial issues when she became pregnant with her son in \n2015. She was underemployed at the time, and she did not have adequate health \ninsurance coverage. She required medical care throughout the pregnancy due to serious \nmedical complications. Immediately after her son\u2019s birth, her son also required medical \ncare. She did not make sufficient income to pay for the medical bills, as she was making \njust enough to pay her monthly expenses. She applied for Medicare twice, but she was \ndenied both times. Her medical bills were referred for collection. (Tr. 20-23; AE B; SOR \nResponse) \n \nThe SOR alleges 16 delinquent debts totaling $42,683. One delinquent account is \nan unpaid utility account in the amount of $50, and the remaining 15 accounts are for \nunpaid medical services. Applicant makes approximately $4 an hour more with her \ncurrent employer, and the record establishes the status of her accounts as follows: (Tr. \n21) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.l, and 1.n allege medical accounts referred to the \nsame collection agency. The total amount of these debts is about $38,107. At the time \nshe responded to the SOR, the supporting documentation showed she had paid off \napproximately $3,000, with the total amount owed to the collection agency then \n$35,120.54. She also disclosed that the collection agency offered her a settlement if she \npaid $7,000. Applicant contacted this creditor to see if she could apply her anticipated \nincome tax refund towards the settlement amount. At the time of the hearing, she was \nuncertain how much her 2018 tax refund totaled. She intends to continue working with \nthis creditor until this debt is settled, or fully resolved. Sufficient evidence shows that these \nmedical accounts are currently being resolved. (Tr. 27-29; SOR Response) \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.h-1.k, and 1.m allege medical accounts referred to a different \ncollection agency totaling about $4,476. Applicant provided documentation that she had \nconsolidated all of these accounts under a repayment agreement. At the time she \nresponded to the SOR, supporting documentation showed the total amount owed to the \ncollection agency was $3,354.63. At the hearing, Applicant provided documentation \nshowing that she made consistent monthly payments in 2018, and she had reduced the \nbalance to less than $2,000. These debts are currently being paid. (Tr. 23-27; AE B, AE \nC, AE D; SOR Response) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o alleges an unpaid utility account in the amount of $50. Applicant denied \nthis allegation in her response to the SOR since she had paid this account in full. This \naccount has been resolved. (Tr. 29; AE B; SOR Response) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p alleges an unpaid medical account referred to a collection agency in \nthe amount of $50. Applicant denied this allegation in her response to the SOR since she \nhad paid this account in full. This account has been resolved. (Tr. 28-29; AE B) \n \nApplicant established a monthly budget to keep track of her family\u2019s monthly \nexpenses. She and her husband have also watched their spending habits; for example, \nif they go out to eat, they do not eat at an expensive restaurant. They are current on their \nmonthly expenses, and she is paying $200 monthly to one collection agency, and $100 \nmonthly to the other collection. Both she and her husband carry health insurance through \ntheir employers. They have not created any new debt, and they file their tax returns every \nyear. (Tr. 32-33, 35; AE E)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor provided a character reference letter for Applicant. (AE A) \nHe is aware of her financial troubles. He has known her for approximately two years, and \nhe finds her work ethic and integrity to be impeccable. She is a reliable employee and he \nfully supports her receiving a security clearance. (Tr. 34-35) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n  \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago,1 was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s complications from her pregnancy, underemployment, and insufficient \nhealth insurance caused her to experience financial difficulties. These are circumstances \nbeyond her control. It is important to note that she paid, is currently paying, or actively \nworking towards resolution all of the debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant made significant \nprogress resolving her delinquent debts, and it is clear that she is committed to repaying \nall of her outstanding medical accounts. Her finances are under control, and future \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) and 20(d) are established, \nand financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \n    \n                                            \n1 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions show financial responsibility and good judgment, and she has \nestablished her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See \nAG \u00b6 18. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nI conclude that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.p:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n       Conclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Pamela C. Benson \n \n \n \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n09/23/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 3, 2017. \nOn February 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 1, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing (SOR Answer 1). On May 29, 2019, the Government \namended the SOR to add an additional allegation under Guideline F. On June 5, 2019, \nApplicant answered the amended SOR, without objection, and admitted the additional \nallegation in his answer to the amended SOR (SOR Answer 2). On June 10, 2019, the \nGovernment sent Applicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 7. He was given an \n\n \n2 \n \nopportunity to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, \nextenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the \nFORM on June 19, 2019, and did not respond. Item 1 contains the pleadings in the \ncase, including the SOR and SOR Answers 1 and 2. Items 2 through 7 are admitted into \nevidence. SOR Answer 1 included documents that were evidentiary in nature, which \nwere admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C. Post-hearing email \ncommunications were collectively admitted as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The case was \nassigned to me on August 29, 2019. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nThe Government included Applicant\u2019s response to interrogatories (Item 4) among \nthe evidentiary items in the FORM. While the response was dated March 9, 2019, the \ninterrogatories were undated, leaving a question about whether they were sent to \nApplicant prior to the issuance of the SOR. On September 13, 2019, I sent an email to \nthe Government (with notice to Applicant) requesting certain information to answer that \nquestion. On September 17 and 18, 2019, the Government responded (with notice to \nApplicant) by providing the requested information. Based on that information, I \ndetermined that the interrogatories were sent to Applicant on February 13, 2019, which \nwas before the SOR was issued on February 15, 2019, as required by Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.2.2. Applicant signed the receipt of the transmittal letter for the February 15, 2019 \nSOR on February 27, 2019. (HE I) \n \nThe record did not specify nor could the Government proffer whether any \nextensions were granted to Applicant for his responses to the SOR and interrogatories. \nNevertheless, because no objections were made, I find that Applicant\u2019s responses were \ntimely. \n \nSOR Amendment \n \nOn May 29, 2019, the Government amended the SOR to add an additional \nGuideline F allegation under paragraph 1, as follows: \n \ni. For tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2016, you failed to file your Federal \nincome tax returns on time, as required.  \n \nThe amended allegation is supported by record evidence that was not known to \nthe Government when the original SOR was issued. (Item 4). On June 5, 2019, \nApplicant answered the amended SOR, without objection, and admitted the additional \nallegation.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I have \nextracted these findings of fact from SOR Answers 1 and 2 (Item 1), and Applicant\u2019s \n2017 SCA (Item 3). Applicant is 45 years old. He shares two children, ages 14 and 19, \nwith his ex-wife, whom he divorced in 2008. He married his current wife in 2011. He \n\n \n3 \n \nhonorably served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1995 through 2008, when he \nwas medically discharged. He earned his associate and bachelor\u2019s degrees in 2007, \nand his master\u2019s degree in 2008. He has been employed by a defense contractor as a \nprofessional services engineer since December 2016. He was previously granted DOD \nsecurity clearances in 1996 and 2005. Applicant submitted a SCA in 2009 (Item 2) for \nreasons not specified in the record.  \n \nApplicant experienced three periods of unemployment after his 2008 service \ndischarge: 1) March 2009 through May 2009, after his employment contract ended; 2) \nDecember 2014 through November 2015, when he voluntarily left his employment after \nhaving a conflict with his supervisor over a medical leave issue; and 3) May 2016 \nthrough December 2016, following a layoff. During his 2009 period of unemployment, he \nwas supported by his step-father, other family members, and his Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA) disability benefits. During his periods of unemployment in 2014 \nand 2016, he was financially supported by his wife\u2019s employment income and his VA \nbenefits. The record does not specify any dollar amounts for these alternate sources of \nincome. (Item 3 at 13-16, 15-23; Item 4 at 26-27) \n \nIn 2010, Applicant received a $62,000 lump-sum severance payment from the Air \nForce. In 2015, he received a $177,000 inheritance in the form of a distribution from a \nfederal retirement account. Applicant attributed the eight delinquent debts alleged in the \nSOR, which totaled $50,418 (including a $23,671 child-support arrearage and a $9,877 \nautomobile loan) to his 2016 period of unemployment.  \n \nApplicant admitted all but one of the eight delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. \nHis admitted debts totaled $44,429. He denied the $5,989 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.h) on the \nbasis that he was \u201cunable to find any evidence\u201d of it in his credit report or during a \nsearch of County A\u2019s judicial records. The judgment was reported in the 2017 credit \nreport provided by the Government in the FORM. It was issued by a court in County B, \nand remains unresolved. (Item 1; Item 5 at 3)  \n \nBetween February and April 2019, Applicant resolved each of the seven admitted \nSOR debts and paid off his federal student loans (which were not in delinquent status). \nHe paid a total of $35,105 to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.c through \n1.g. He paid all but one (SOR \u00b6 1.g/$737) of the seven debts after receiving the SOR. \nThe amounts he paid to resolve the automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and pay off his student \nloans were not specified in the record. (Item 1; Item 7 at 2; AE C)  \n \nIn 2014, Applicant borrowed money to pay for the university where he earned his \nbachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees via federal student loans totaling $47,278. In \nNovember 2017, when his loans were in deferment status, he promised to resume his \nloan payments in July 2018. The record did not specify the amount or duration of the \nloan payments that he made. However, the loans were paid in full in February 2019. \n(AE B; Item 4 at 32) \n \nApplicant admitted that he failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2010 through 2013, and 2016. He filed his 2010 through 2013 returns in \n\n \n4 \n \nAugust 2014, and his 2016 returns in February 2018. He timely filed his 2014, 2015, \nand 2017 returns. The status of his 2018 return was not specified in the record. (Item 4 \nat 7-22) \n \nApplicant also failed to timely pay his federal income taxes for tax years 2010 \nthrough 2015, and 2017, which was not alleged in the SOR. He owed approximately \n$22,293 (after withholding and exclusive of penalties and interest). He established \ninstallment agreements with the IRS to repay his delinquent taxes in August 2014 (for \ntax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014); in June 2016 (for tax year 2015); and in \nJune 2018 (for tax year 2017). The IRS account transcripts reveal a sporadic payment \nhistory and entries suggesting that Applicant received hardship accommodations. By \nMarch 2019, the tax delinquencies were resolved for tax years 2010 through 2017 \nthrough amounts paid directly by Applicant and tax refunds applied by the IRS from \nother tax years. Between 2014 and 2018, Applicant\u2019s payments totaled approximately \n$8,359 for tax years 2010 through 2015, with no payments for tax year 2017. Because \nthe SOR alleged only the failure to timely file his tax returns, I will consider his failure to \ntimely pay his taxes only for the purposes of mitigation and whole-person analysis. (Item \n4 at 7-22) \n \nApplicant did not specify the reason for his failure to timely file his tax returns. \nHowever, he attributed his failure to timely pay his taxes to having insufficient income \n(due to unemployment and a child-support arrearage) to cover the additional taxes \nassociated with unanticipated income earned in 2010 and 2015. He reported owing \nadditional taxes of $20,000 following the 2010 severance payment, and $15,000 \nfollowing the 2015 inheritance. (Item 3 at 42-43; Item 4 at 29) \n \n \nBy late 2017, Applicant asserted that he was financially stable and unlikely to \nhave a recurrence of financial difficulties. He promised to resolve his delinquent debts \nwhen he could \u201cafford to do so.\u201d He has not had any financial counseling. (Item 4 at 29-\n30, 31-32). \n \nThe record did not enumerate the income, including from the VA, that Applicant \nor his wife earned or their ongoing expenses (besides Applicant\u2019s child support \nobligation) since his 2008 discharge. Applicant reported his payments for child support \nas $2,200 monthly, and for the arrearage as $1,150 bi-weekly. He asserted that he used \nthe money received from his 2010 severance and 2015 inheritance for living expenses \nand debts caused by his 2008 divorce, without detailing any specific amounts. (Item 3 at \n13-16 and 44; Item 4 at 26-27 and 29; Items 5 through 7) \n \nApplicant disclosed a prior period of financial instability when he reported \ndelinquent debts totaling $38,344 on a November 2009 SCA. Applicant did not \nspecifically address the underlying cause of those debts in the record. However, his \n2008 divorce and 2009 unemployment could have been factors. (Item 2; Item 4 at 29) \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at \n3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a \ndisqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his credit reports establish the following disqualifying \nconditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required). \n \n \nThe following are potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \nApplicant filed his delinquent federal income tax returns and made arrangements \nto resolve his delinquent federal taxes before he received the SOR. His taxes were \nresolved by March 2009. AG \u00b6 20(g) is established. However, he did not initiate action \nto repay his admitted SOR debts until February 2019. He paid all but one $737 debt \nafter receiving the SOR. A $5,989 judgment remains unresolved. Because he \nsubstantially addressed the concerns of the SOR, the key consideration in evaluating \nhis security worthiness is whether he acted responsibly.  \n \nApplicant failed to establish justifiable reasons for failing to timely file his tax \nreturns, and for his delay in initiating action to repay his delinquent debts. The fact that \nhe could not afford to pay his taxes did not absolve him of the obligation to file his \nreturns. His repeated failure to timely file them over an extended period of time did not \ndemonstrate responsible action.  \n \nApplicant waited until after he was prompted by the SOR to pay the majority of \nhis debts, including his child-support arrearage. He repaid them with substantial funds \navailable to him within a relatively short period of time (even after also paying off his \nstudent loans), suggesting that he may have had prior access to them. He received a \n$177,000 inheritance in 2015, became gainfully employed in December 2016, and has \nbeen financially stable since at least late 2017. Exacerbated by his failure to respond to \nthe FORM, the record contains insufficient detail and documentation about Applicant\u2019s \nability to repay his debts and the reasons they persisted. Therefore, I am unable to \nunequivocally conclude that Applicant acted responsibly.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s failed to demonstrate facts sufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), \nor 20(d). His inexcusable delays in timely filing his tax returns and resolving his \ndelinquent debts leave me with doubts as to his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment that I must resolve in the Government\u2019s favor. In light of the record before me, \nI cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by his history of financial indebtedness and failure to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 45-year-old defense-contractor employee with a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in 1995 and a master\u2019s degree awarded in 1997. More recently, he took some online courses between October 2011 and May 2012 and night classes in person at a local private university. Applicant has worked for his employer since November 2017, initially learning electrical drafting. In April 2018, he transferred to detail planning for a full-time salaried position, and in December 2018, he was scheduled for another transfer to quality control. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 29-31.) Applicant has never previously held a DOD security clearance and understands that he does not need clearance eligibility to keep his current job. (Tr. 33.) 3 Applicant and his spouse married in 1998, and they have two children ages 13 and 16. (GE 1; Tr. 30.) Applicant\u2019s spouse has a bachelor\u2019s degree and also a law degree, which she earned in 1998. She practiced law for only about 1.5 years. In approximately February 2002, she stopped working while pregnant with their daughter and was a stay-at- home mom for the next 15 years. (Tr. 33-35.) In 2003, Applicant moved his family to their current state of residence for him to work at a new private boarding school as a teacher.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant owes approximately $241,503 in defaulted Federal student-loan debt, \ncharged-off credit-card debts totaling more than $5,000, and some collection debts. \nUnemployment and low income were factors in the delinquencies, but more progress is \nneeded toward resolving his debts to find that his financial problems are safely behind him. \nClearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 17, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n01/10/2019\n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 10, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On \nSeptember 7, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On October 5, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for November 16, \n2018. \n \nAt the hearing, five Government exhibits (GEs 1-5) were admitted. A May 31, 2018 \nletter (HE 1) and a November 5, 2018 email (HE II) forwarding the proposed GEs to \nApplicant, and a list of the GEs (HE III) were marked as hearing exhibits (HE) for the record \nbut not admitted in evidence. Five Applicant exhibits (AEs A-E) were admitted in evidence. \nApplicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on November 29, 2018. \n \nI held the record open for one month for post-hearing documentation from Applicant. \nNo documents were received by the December 16, 2018 deadline, and I closed the record \non that date. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of April 17, 2018, Applicant was \ndelinquent on Federal student loans totaling $189,722 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j); owed charged-off \ncredit-card debts of $3,252 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) and $2,743 (SOR \u00b6 1.l); a $1,086 collection debt \nfor music and arts (SOR \u00b6 1.m); and three medical collection debts for $447 (SOR \u00b6 1.n), \n$435 (SOR \u00b6 1.o), and $121 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). In his Answer to the SOR allegations, Applicant \nadmitted the debts without explanation with the exception of the $435 collection debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.o), which he indicated \u201cwas paid effective 3/6/2018.\u201d \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old defense-contractor employee with a bachelor\u2019s degree \nawarded in 1995 and a master\u2019s degree awarded in 1997. More recently, he took some \nonline courses between October 2011 and May 2012 and night classes in person at a local \nprivate university. Applicant has worked for his employer since November 2017, initially \nlearning electrical drafting. In April 2018, he transferred to detail planning for a full-time \nsalaried position, and in December 2018, he was scheduled for another transfer to quality \ncontrol. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 29-31.) Applicant has never previously held a DOD security \nclearance and understands that he does not need clearance eligibility to keep his current \njob. (Tr. 33.) \n \n\n3 \n \nApplicant and his spouse married in 1998, and they have two children ages 13 and \n16. (GE 1; Tr. 30.) Applicant\u2019s spouse has a bachelor\u2019s degree and also a law degree, \nwhich she earned in 1998. She practiced law for only about 1.5 years. In approximately \nFebruary 2002, she stopped working while pregnant with their daughter and was a stay-at-\nhome mom for the next 15 years. (Tr. 33-35.) \n \nIn 2003, Applicant moved his family to their current state of residence for him to \nwork at a new private boarding school as a teacher. His salary decreased by $10,000 to \nabout $30,000, but housing was provided. (Tr. 26-37.) In January 2009, Applicant and his \nspouse purchased their residence in a short sale for $175,000 to $180,000. (GE 1; Tr. 46-\n47.) \n \nWhile employed at the boarding school, Applicant began taking college classes part \ntime at night and also online. (GE 1; Tr. 57-59.) Between August 2009 and January 2014, \nhe obtained Federal student loans totaling approximately $115,951.1 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j). \n(GEs 2-5.) In August 2011, Applicant left his employment at the boarding school. (GE 2.) \nHe taught at a magnet school for the next academic year with a temporary teacher \ncertification. His contract was not renewed after the school year because he had not \nfinished his schooling for his teacher certification. (GE 1; Tr. 36-39.) Applicant was \nunemployed during the summer of 2012, but then taught at another school from August \n2012 to June 2014. (GE 1.) In July 2013, his vehicle was repossessed for nonpayment of a \ncar loan obtained for $20,497 in October 2007. With funds obtained from his parents, he \npaid off the debt and redeemed the vehicle in January 2014. (GEs 2-5.) \n \nIn August 2014, Applicant began teaching in a public school system. He was allergic \nto the mold in the building and resigned for health reasons when the school year ended in \nJune 2015. Applicant began working as a teacher for another public school system in July \n2015, but he left the job in February 2016 because his daughter had been diagnosed with \na disability. Over the next 21 months, he worked on and off as a substitute teacher for \nseveral school districts earning $75 to $85 an hour. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 36-42.) Due to lack of \nincome and medical bills (Tr. 71), he did not make any payments on his Federal student \nloans which he was obligated to repay starting in July 2015. Nine of his student loans were \nrated as seriously delinquent as of October 2016. (GEs 2-5.) Applicant and his spouse \nbecame delinquent on their mortgage loan in October 2015, and foreclosure proceedings \ncommenced in approximately April 2016. (GEs 2-3; AE A.) A lien was placed on their home \nin July 2017 for nonpayment of a medical judgment debt of approximately $360. (AE E; Tr. \n25, 53-54.) \n \nIn April 2017, Applicant\u2019s spouse began working during the day as a school para-\nprofessional 18 hours per week at $17 an hour and nights and weekends at a public library \nfour to eight hours per week at $11 an hour. (Tr. 27-28, 44-45.) In September 2017, \n                                                 \n1 Applicant testified that one or two of his student loans are consolidated loans for his undergraduate \neducation, but that most of his loans were incurred for his graduate school and his education coursework. (Tr. \n57, 60.) Two of his student loans are consolidated loans obtained on July 6, 2012. (GEs 3-5.) The loans \nconsolidated in 2012 may be from his undergraduate education. \n\n4 \n \nApplicant began working as a part-time math teacher at a night school three hours per \nweek at $60 an hour. (Tr. 33.) He was otherwise unemployed. (Tr. 42.) \n \nOn August 16, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to an inquiry concerning \nany financial delinquency involving enforcement in the last seven years, Applicant indicated \nthat a lien was against his house for nonpayment of a medical debt that had been brought \nto judgment. He indicated that he had arranged to pay $150 by the end of August 2017 and \nto pay the $157 remaining by the end of September 2017. He disclosed no other past-due \ndebts. (GE 1.) \n \nAs of September 12, 2017, Applicant\u2019s student loans were $119,910 past due and in \ncollection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j). A credit-card account opened in February 2013 was past due \nand in collection for $2,743 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). A second credit card with the same creditor, \nobtained in December 2014, was in collection for $3,252 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). A music and arts \ndebt for $1,086 was in collection as of August 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.m). Medical collection debts \nof $435 from July 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.o), $121 from August 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.p), and $447 \nassigned in May 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.n) were also outstanding. (GE 2.) \n \nOn September 27, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant explained about the medical debt \ndisclosed on his SF 86 that he and his spouse could not pay the bill because they were \nunemployed at the time. When asked whether he owed any other delinquencies, Applicant \nvolunteered that his home loan was in foreclosure, and that he had several other \noutstanding past-due balances. When confronted with the details of his debts, Applicant \naverred that he thought his student loans were in deferment because of his unemployment. \nHe acknowledged the outstanding credit card and music debts, and explained that the \nmusic debt was for a saxophone for his son. Applicant acknowledged that he owed medical \ndebts, and that one medical provider had obtained a judgment lien on his home. He \nindicated that he had paid $187.70 toward the debt but still owed $180.15. As for the \nmortgage, Applicant admitted that his mortgage loan was in foreclosure for the last 18 \nmonths, but that he was in mediation to resolve the delinquency.2 He indicated that he was \nseeking full-time employment for the income to allow him to begin repaying his delinquent \ndebts. (GE 2.) \n \nIn November 2017, Applicant began his defense-contractor employment at an hourly \nwage of approximately $16 while continuing to work nights as a math teacher until June \n2018. (GE 2; Tr. 31-33.) Applicant was re-interviewed by the investigator on November 13, \n2017. He was unable to provide any update to his financial situation other than to indicate \nthat he could try to pay off his debts now that he had full-time employment. (GE 2.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on January 9, 2018, revealed no progress toward \nresolving his Federal student loans, which totaled $189,722 and were $134,911 past due. \nThe credit card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l had been charged off. Applicant also owed \n                                                 \n2 Applicant testified that he was paying an attorney $500 a month until December 2018 to assist him and his \nspouse in obtaining a modification of their home mortgage loan. (Tr. 65-66.) \n\n5 \n \nthree medical collection debts for $435, $326, and $121. Applicant was making payments \non six consumer credit accounts with balances totaling $2,465. (GE 4.) On March 6, 2018, \nApplicant paid the $435 medical collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.o). \n \nIn April 2018, Applicant underwent a department transfer at work for a salaried \nposition at $48,000 annually (approximately $23 per hour). He routinely works five to ten \nhours per week in overtime. (Tr. 31-32.) During the summer of 2018, Applicant\u2019s spouse \nfilled in for several employees at the library, and she worked extra hours. (Tr. 44.) \n \nOn July 20, 2018, Applicant agreed to pay $5 per month for nine consecutive \nmonths as a trial rehabilitation for his defaulted Federal student loans. His first payment \nwas due September 15, 2018. Under the agreement, Applicant agreed to continue to make \nmonthly payments after the minimum nine payments until he is notified in writing by the \nloan servicer that the rehabilitation has been completed. The loan servicer would then \nestablish a new monthly payment amount based on the balance owed at the time the loans \nare rehabilitated. (AE C.) In September 2018, Applicant made a payment of approximately \n$249 that was disbursed among his Federal student loans. (GE 5.) As of November 2018, \nhis Federal student loans totaled $241,503. (AE C.) \n \n \nOn September 27, 2018, Applicant entered into a Federal Housing Authority Trial \nRepayment Plan for his delinquent mortgage loan with a principal balance of $177,110. \nUnder the terms, Applicant agreed to make monthly payments of $1,703 from October 1, \n2018, through December 1, 2018. Should Applicant miss a payment, the state housing \nauthority reserved the right to a foreclosure action. Applicant made a $1,703 payment \nposted on October 11, 2018. The housing authority acknowledged receipt of the payment \nbut issued a delinquency notice billing Applicant for the $57,205 past due on the loan. \nApplicant was informed that failure to pay the $57,205 by November 1, 2018, could result \nin fees and foreclosure. (AE B.) Applicant testified that he made a second payment of \n$1,703 in the week preceding his November 16, 2018 hearing (Tr. 48-49), but he provided \nno documentation of that payment. \n \n \nThe creditor owed the balances in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l filed to garnish Applicant\u2019s \nwages to recover a judgment awarded for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k. On October 3, 2018, \nApplicant asked for a modification to repay the debt at $75 per week. The creditor agreed \nto the modification on October 22, 2018. (AE D.) After the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k is satisfied, \nApplicant intends to have the garnishment continue until his other debt with the creditor \n(SOR \u00b6 1.l) is paid off. (Tr. 66-69.) \n \n \n As of early to mid-October 2018, Applicant had not paid the $121 medical collection \ndebt from August 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). He contacted the provider and was referred to the \ncollection entity that has no record of the debt. (Tr. 75.) Two open credit-card accounts for \ngasoline were past due in amounts of $111 on a balance of $608 and for $120 on a \nbalance of $607. He contacted the creditor owed the $608 debt and has initiated a plan to \naddress the delinquency in three installment payments. A retail charge card obtained in \nAugust 2015 was $27 past due on a balance of $361. Applicant has a plan in place to \naddress that delinquency by January 2019. (Tr. 82-83.) He had made no payments on the \n\n6 \n \naccount in SOR \u00b6 1.l since February 2017, and the past-due balance had accrued to \n$2,743. After a September 2018 payment on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k, he owed $3,329 on \nthat delinquent account. Applicant was making timely payments on four open consumer \ncredit accounts with balances totaling $1,783. (GE 5.) The music debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 \n1.m) was no longer on Applicant\u2019s credit report. Applicant recalls that he may have mailed \nthe creditor a check for $700, but he provided no documentation to corroborate the \npayment even though I left the record open for post-hearing submissions. (Tr. 73-74.) The \nmedical collection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n was no longer on his credit record as of November \n2018. (GE 5.) Applicant believes that he made a payment to his daughter\u2019s psychologist \n(Tr. 75), but he provided no proof.  \n \nApplicant estimated that he had only $3 in his bank accounts as of mid-November \n2018. He has retirement assets \u201cin the thousands\u201d in one account that he cannot access \nbefore age 59\u00bd. He recently applied to close out an $8,000 teacher\u2019s retirement account \nand was notified that it would be processed effective December 31, 2018. He plans to use \nthe funds to pay some bills. (Tr. 77-78.) Applicant owes approximately $580 in Federal \nincome taxes for tax year 2017. When the taxes were due in April 2018, he entered into a \nrepayment arrangement with the Internal Revenue Service to repay the debt in $50 \nmonthly installments, but there was a problem with debiting his account, so no payments \nhad been withdrawn from his account as of mid-November 2018. (Tr. 79-80.) Applicant\u2019s \nhousehold finances have improved since October 2017, as evidenced by the housing \nauthority\u2019s willingness to grant him the loan modification. He had previously been denied \nmodification because of insufficient income. (Tr. 80-81.) \n \nApplicant estimates that he paid \u201cthousands of dollars\u201d in medical expenses for \ntherapy visits for himself in 2005 and for his children since 2012 or 2013. His children see a \ntherapist once a month, but it has been at no charge for the past year. (Tr. 84-85.) \nApplicant was diagnosed with a form of high-functioning autism and asks that it be \nconsidered in mitigation. (Tr. 52.)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \n\n7 \n \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \n\n8 \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the available credit reports establish the delinquencies \nalleged in the SOR. Applicant defaulted on Federal student loans that were obtained for \napproximately $115,951 and have accrued to $241,503. Two credit-card accounts were \ncharged off for $3,329 and $2,743. Some medical debts and a $1,086 debt for his son\u2019s \nsaxophone were placed for collection. Moreover, although not alleged in the SOR, the \nevidence shows that Applicant\u2019s mortgage loan on his home loan was past due for $57,205 \nas of October 11, 2018. He had made only one payment on one loan since October 2015, \nof $1,703 under a loan modification plan in September 2018. That delinquency cannot be \nconsidered for disqualifying purposes because it was not alleged.3 Even without \nconsidering the mortgage, disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d \nand 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d clearly apply.  \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing matters in mitigation. One or more of the \nfollowing conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n                                                 \n3 In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in \nwhich conduct not alleged in a SOR may be considered, as follows: \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \n \nApplicant\u2019s handling of his mortgage loan is relevant in assessing his financial situation generally and matters \nin reform.  \n \n\n9 \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies are too extensive and recent for mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(a). His Federal student loans were first considered delinquent in July 2015. The credit-\ncard debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l first became delinquent in October 2016 and were placed \nfor collection in May 2017. Available credit reports do not show the date that the music debt \nwas initially incurred, but it was still in collection as of August 2017. The $121 and $435 \nmedical collection debts were assigned for collection in 2016 and were unpaid as of August \n2017. The $447 medical collection debt was assigned for collection in May 2017. \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused in part by low \nincome due to decisions that either he or his spouse made. An attorney by education, \nApplicant\u2019s spouse chose to stay at home to care for their children. She was unemployed \nfor approximately 15 years before obtaining part-time work in April 2017 as a school para-\nprofessional and at a library. Applicant lost his full-time teaching position at a magnet \nschool in 2012 because he failed to obtain his teaching certification. He resigned from his \nnext teaching job in June 2015 because of health issues caused by mold in the building. \nHe secured another full-time teaching position for the next academic year, but stayed only \nuntil February 2016 because his daughter was diagnosed with a disability. However, his \nspouse was unemployed at that time, so one has to question his financial judgment in \ngiving up the income needed to support his family. He then worked as a substitute teacher \non and off until November 2017 when he began his defense-contractor employment. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) has some applicability in that his income as a substitute teacher after February 2016 \nwas not enough to cover all of the household obligations, including non-discretionary \nmedical expenses for his children. However, Applicant did not show sound financial \njudgment in his handling of his Federal student loans. He told an OPM investigator in \nSeptember 2017 that he thought his student loans were deferred because he was \nunemployed. He had an obligation to keep himself apprised about the status of his sizeable \nstudent-loan debt, even if he could not afford to make payments. He has yet to resolve a \n$121 medical collection debt, despite the increase in his income with his transfer to a \nsalaried position in April 2018. He testified that the collection entity can find no record of \nthe debt, but he did not provide the documentation from which I could conclude that he has \ndone all he can to address the debt. He testified that he made payments toward the \ncollection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n but provided no proof. \n \n\n10 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s favor, he satisfied the medical collection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o in March \n2018. In July 2018, he made repayment arrangements toward rehabilitating his Federal \nstudent loans. A recent credit report of November 2018 shows that he paid $249 in \nSeptember 2018 toward his student loans. The charged-off credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k is \nbeing repaid through garnishment of his wages, although only after a judgment action was \nbrought by the creditor. The garnishment is likely to continue until the judgment debt is \nsatisfied. Yet, Applicant lacks a sufficient track record of timely debt repayments from \nwhich I could reasonably conclude that he can be counted on to continue to address his \nsubstantial delinquencies. \n \nStudent loans are considered an investment in one\u2019s future, but his $241,503 in \nstudent-loan debt is a significant burden in relation to his annual income of $48,000. While \nthe $5 monthly payments required of him through April 2019 are minimal, a new amount \nwill be established by the loan servicer once his student loans are rehabilitated. Applicant \ntestified that he is currently paying an attorney $500 a month for assistance in resolving his \ndelinquent mortgage loan, and that those payments to the attorney end in December 2018. \nHowever, even assuming that he will then have $500 available to put toward his financial \nobligations, other debts may well take priority. His handling of his trial modification for his \nmortgage provides little assurance of timely debt repayment. Applicant was required to \nmake three monthly payments $1,703 due on the first of the month from October 2018 \nthrough December 2018. His October 2018 payment was not received until October 11, \n2018. At his November 16, 2018 hearing, he testified that he mailed his second payment \u201ca \nweek ago,\u201d and so that payment would have been late as well. His application to withdraw \nretirement assets to pay off some debts is another indicator of financial stress. He was \nbehind on some open credit-card accounts as of September 2018, perhaps because he \npaid $249 toward his student loans that month. He estimated that he had only $3 in \nchecking deposits as of mid-November 2018. In April 2018, he entered into an installment \nagreement to repay his $580 in Federal taxes owed for 2017, but no payments had been \nmade as of November 2018 because of an issue with his automatic payments. Applicant\u2019s \nongoing failure to address that problem is another example of questionable financial \njudgment that is not adequately explained by his disability. Applicant has yet to make any \npayments on the credit-card delinquency in SOR \u00b6 1.l. He testified to his belief that he paid \napproximately $700 for his son\u2019s saxophone (SOR \u00b6 1.m), and that he made a payment to \nhis daughter\u2019s psychologist (SOR \u00b6 1.n), but he provided no proof. AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 \n20(d) are only minimally established. Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n\n11 \n \n \nApplicant incurred out-of-pocket medical expenses for his children in recent years \nthat strained his already tenuous finances. Due to factors outside of his control, but also to \nchoices that he or his spouse made with regard to employment, Applicant defaulted on his \nmortgage loan, his Federal student loans, and on two credit-card accounts. One year into \nhis employment with a defense contractor, Applicant has arrangements in place toward \nrehabilitating his student loans and his mortgage loan, but concerns persist about his \nfinancial stability and judgment. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nrenewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). For the reasons noted, I cannot find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant security-clearance eligibility at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.n: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n05/01/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to deny her \neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns raised by his history of marijuana use, including after \nbeing granted a security clearance and access to sensitive compartmented information \n(SCI) in 2011. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 11, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the drug involvement and substance misuse and personal \nconduct guidelines.1 DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that \n                                                          \n1 The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended \n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017.   \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nthe case be submitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nadministrative judge for a determination whether to deny his security clearance.  \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. At the hearing, \nconvened on November 28, 2018, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, \nwithout objection. Applicant testified at the hearing, as did two character witnesses. He \ndid not offer any additional documents for consideration. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on December 7, 2018.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 38, has worked for his employer, a federal contacting company, as a \nsoftware engineer since August 2013. He worked for another federal contracting from \n2011 to 2013. He initially completed a security clearance application in 2009 in \nanticipation of employment. However, the application was denied in January 2010 by \nanother government agency (OGA), citing Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana use and his \ndeliberate failure to disclose it on his security clearance application. Applicant reapplied \nfor access to classified information in early 2011, this time disclosing his previous \nmarijuana use. In February 2011, he signed OGA\u2019s security policy advisory about \nimproper drug use, confirming his understanding that use of illegal drugs was strictly \nprohibited and that failure to observe the policy could constitute grounds for \ndisqualification from access to OGA facilities and information. He completed a \npolygraph examination in March 2011 and expressed his willingness to comply with \nOGA\u2019s drug deterrence policy. In April 2011, OGA granted Applicant a top-secret \nclearance and access to SCI.2  \n \nApplicant completed his most recent security clearance application in January \n2016, disclosing marijuana use in July 2014 and again in July 2015. He confirmed the \ndetails of his marijuana use in an October 2016 subject interview. In May 2017, OGA \nsuspended Applicant\u2019s access to classified information and SCI.3  \n \n \nIn August 2013, Applicant began working for his current employer as a senior \nsoftware engineer. Although he was subject to urinalysis testing upon hiring, his \nemployer does subject its employees to random urinalysis. In the summer 2014, he was \npromoted to a director position, supervising 33 people. Shortly after assuming his new \nposition, Applicant used marijuana with his wife at the home of another couple. He used \nthe drug again under the same circumstances a year later. He claims he did not report \nthe marijuana use at the time of either incident because he did not know he had an \nobligation to do so. However, he acknowledged that he feared disclosure would result in \nthe loss of his job. When OGA suspended Applicant\u2019s clearance in May 2017, his \nemployer, moved him to another director level position that does not require access to \nclassified information. While his employer acknowledges Applicant\u2019s lapse in judgment, \nthey do not believe his actions were malicious or done with the intent to compromise \n                                                          \n2 GE 1 - 2.  \n \n3 Tr. 33, 38, 46-52. \n\n \n3 \n \nnational security. The company continues to endorse Applicant\u2019s ongoing access to \nclassified information. 4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of illegal drug use began in college. Applicant admits to using \nmarijuana at least twice each semester between 1999 and 2002. He abstained from \nillegal drug use for the next six years because the drug no longer appealed to him. He \nbegan using the drug again between 2008 and 2009, while he was self-employed. He \nand his wife used the drug together, at least once per month, at home. In 2008, he also \nattempted to grow marijuana plants from seeds, citing an interest in horticulture. \nApplicant described his use in 2014 and 2015 as a single puff on a marijuana cigarette. \nHe admits that each time he used marijuana, he recalled the OGA drug policy advisory. \nApplicant admits stress management has motivated his use of marijuana over the \nyears. In September 2017, Applicant sought a substance abuse evaluation. Based on \nthe in-person evaluation and the results of a battery of tests, the psychologist \ndetermined that Applicant did not have a substance abuse problem or any other mental-\nhealth problem that would significantly impair his judgment.5  \n \n \nIn addition to the psychological evaluation, Applicant also attended two additional \nsessions with the psychologist. Applicant believes that he has learned how to better \nidentify and handle his stress levels. He believes he has implemented habits to support \nhis sobriety, such as regular exercise. Applicant\u2019s wife obtained a medical marijuana \ncard from a friend who is a physician. He believes that she continues to use marijuana \nin their home at least once per month. Applicant claims that he does not intend to use \nmarijuana in the future, and provided a signed statement to that effect.6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 34-35; 58-59, 69-70; Answer. \n \n5 Tr. 38-40, 42-46, 53-56, 66, 71-73; Answer.  \n \n6 Tr. 40-42, 54, 60-65, 68-69, 75; Answer.  \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness, because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.7 Applicant admits a history of \nmarijuana use, with varying frequency, from 1999 to 2009 that resulted in his being \ndenied a security clearance in 2010. He also admits to using marijuana on two \noccasions after being granted access to classified information and SCI in 2011. His \nconduct invokes drug involvement and substance misuse disqualifying conditions \u00b6 \n25(a) and \u00b6 25(f). Furthermore, Applicant used marijuana after signing the OGA drug \npolicy advisory, which clearly stated that violation of the policy could result in the \nrevocation of access to OGA facilities and information, both of which he required for his \nposition at the time. Personal conduct disqualifying condition \u00b616(f) applies. None of the \ndrug involvement or personal conduct mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nOGA granted Applicant access to classified information in 2011 after he gave \nwritten and verbal assurances that he would not use illegal drugs in the future. He \n                                                          \n7  See, AG \u00b6 24.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nvoluntarily and willfully made this commitment. He then reneged on his promise and \nchose not to disclose his misconduct to OGA to protect his self-interests. This is not \nmitigated by the favorable facts in the record: the passage of time since his last known \nuse of illegal drugs; his understanding and management of his triggers; the changes he \nmade in his life to support sobriety; and the endorsement of his employer of his request \nfor continued access to classified information.  \n \nBased on the record, I have significant reservations about Applicant\u2019s current \nsecurity worthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). The purpose of the security clearance adjudication is to \nmake \u201can examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d8 Applicant engaged in \nconduct that supports a negative whole-person assessment of his judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. His behavior also casts doubt on his ability to follow rules and \nregulations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and  \nSubstance Misuse:   \n \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nAGAINST APPPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n________________________ \nNichole L.

Schachter, Esq. \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant wants to resume linguist duties in a conflict area outside of the United \nStates. His half brother lives in Somalia, and his sister lives in Kenya. His contacts with \nthem are limited, and he has strong connections to the United States. He mitigated \nforeign influence security concerns relating to his connections to Somalia and Kenya. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nHistory of the Case \nOn January 5, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On March 28, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February \n20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.   \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \n04/04/2019\n\n \n2                                                                                                                                             \nfor Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the \nSOR set forth security concerns arising under the foreign influence guideline.  \n \nOn April 20, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 4) On October 1, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed. On October 4, 2018, the case was assigned to another administrative judge, \nand on February 7, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On February 21, 2019, \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel was notified of the date, time, and location of the hearing by email. \n(HE 5) On March 1, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na notice of hearing, setting the hearing for March 12, 2019. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing \nwas held as scheduled. (Transcript (Tr.) 13) Applicant waived his right to 15 days of \nnotice of the date, time, and location of his hearing. (Tr. 14-15)  \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits, Applicant \nsubmitted the six exhibits as attachments to his SOR response; there were no \nobjections; and all of Department Counsel\u2019s proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence.

(Tr. 13; GE 2-GE 5) Department Counsel also provided supporting \ndocumentation. (GE 2-GE 5) Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice \nof facts concerning Somalia and Kenya, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. \n(Tr. 15) Applicant requested administrative notice of the absence of evidence that the \ngovernments of Somalia and Kenya engage in the following activities: (1) spy on the \nUnited States or commit espionage against the United States; and (2) encourage or \nsponsor terrorism. (Tr. 17-18) There is no record evidence that terrorists use residents \nof Kenya or Somalia to coerce their relatives in the United States to breach U.S. \nsecurity. (Tr. 17-18) Department Counsel responded stating that the Government\u2019s \nadministrative notice materials provided a fair discussion of the security concerns \nrelating to foreign interest pertaining to Somalia and Kenya. (Tr. 19-20) I agreed to take \nadministrative notice of the absence of facts as outlined by Applicant.

(Tr. 27)   \n \nApplicant said he believed that he renounced his Somali citizenship; however, he \ndid not provide details about how or when he renounced his Somali citizenship. (Tr. 39, \n50) He took the Naturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America, which \nstates: \n \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and \nabjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \nsovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; \nthat I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will \n                                            \n1 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names \nof other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant\u2019s and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources \ncontain more specific information. \n \n\n \n4                                                                                                                                             \nbear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf \nof the United States when required by the law; that I will perform \nnoncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when \nrequired by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under \ncivilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation \nfreely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me \nGod.2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s half brother is about 66 years old, and he was a Somali police officer. \n(Tr. 31, 46; SOR response) His half brother supervised other police officers; however, \nApplicant was unsure whether his focus was on street-level crime or other crime. (Tr. \n48-49) Applicant has not met with his half brother since 2002. (Tr. 31) Applicant \nbelieves his half brother is retired because of his age; however, Applicant has not asked \nhis half brother about whether he is retired. (Tr. 40-42, 45) Applicant communicates with \nhis half brother every few months. (Tr. 31; SOR response) Most likely in the future, he \nwill communicate with his half brother less frequently. (Tr. 33)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister lives in a refugee camp in Kenya. (Tr. 32; SOR response) She \nis 51 years old. (Tr. 32; SOR response) He has not seen her since 1991, and he \ncommunicates with her \u201cperhaps once a year by telephone.\u201d (Tr. 32; SOR response)3 \nFor about three years, he has sent about $200 twice a year to his half brother, who then \nprovided the funds to his sister. (Tr. 42-43, 47-48) In the future, he does not intend to \ncommunicate with his sister. (Tr. 33) Applicant\u2019s half brother maintains contact with his \nsister, and Applicant learns about her situation from him. (Tr. 48) \n \nApplicant said if his relatives in Somalia or Kenya contacted him and asked for \nclassified or sensitive information, he would report the contact to his security officer or to \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation. (Tr. 34-36) \n \nSomalia \n \nIn 2012, Somalia was established as a federal parliamentary republic.4 The \nUnited States recognized the Federal Government of Somalia in January 2013. U.S. \nforeign policy objectives in Somalia are to promote economic and political stability, \npromote democratic reforms, oppose international terrorism, and alleviate humanitarian \ncrisis caused by conflict and bad weather. The United States supports the success of the \nAfrican Union Mission in driving al-Shabaab, a terrorist organization, out of strategically \n                                            \n2 The language of the current Oath of Allegiance is found in the Code of Federal Regulations \nSection 337.1 and is closely based upon the statutory elements in Section 337(a) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1448, https://www.uscis.gov/us-\ncitizenship/naturalization-test/naturalization-oath-allegiance-united-states-america. \n \n3 Later in his hearing, Applicant said he had not spoken to, contacted, or emailed his sister since \n1991. (Tr. 43) He clarified that he did not remember any conversations with her, and he could not confirm \nthat he spoke to her or communicated with her. (Tr. 44-45) From Applicant\u2019s responses to some \nquestions at the hearing, it is apparent that he has some difficulties communicating in English. \n \n4 The facts in this paragraph are from U.S. Department of State, U.S. Relations with Somalia Fact \nSheet (Aug. 13, 2018) (GE 2, Item 1). \n\n \n5                                                                                                                                             \nimportant population centers. The United States provided more than $3 billion in \nassistance to Somalia from 2006 to present. The United States supports and works \nclosely with Somalia to establish an effective and representative security sector including \nmilitary, police, and justice officials.   \n \nThe State Department has issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory for Somalia advising \nU.S. citizens not to travel to Somalia due to crime, terrorism, and piracy. Violent crime is \ncommon throughout Somalia, and criminals target foreigners in Somalia. Terrorism is an \nongoing threat throughout Somalia. The State Department designated Somali-based Al-\nShabaab as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Al-Shabaab has frequently attacked a \nvariety of targets in Somalia with a wide range of weapons and explosives. In four \nattacks in 2017, Al-Shabaab killed more than 100 people. The majority of those killed in \nthe four attacks were soldiers and police officers. \n \nIn Somalia, human rights abuses occur primarily because of Al-Shabaab\u2019s lawless \nbehavior. Some government officials have also engaged in rapes, extortions, and \nmurders with impunity.  \n \nKenya \n \n \nKenya is a republic with three branches of government: a president, who is \ndirectly elected by the people; a bicameral parliament; and a judiciary. After an election \nwhich was disputed in Kenya\u2019s Supreme Court, President Kenyatta took office on \nNovember 20, 2017.  The United States and Kenya have partnered in counterterrorism \nefforts. \n \n \nOn March 29, 2018, the State Department issued a Level 2 Travel Advisory for \nKenya \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d and indicated \u201cdo not travel\u201d to the Kenya-Somalia \nborder and some coastal areas due to terrorism.\u201d Violent crime and terrorism occur \nthroughout Kenya and are ongoing threats. Somali-based Al-Shabaab and ISIS operate \nin Kenya. Terrorists have frequently attacked a variety of targets in Kenya utilizing a wide \nrange of weapons and explosives. In 23 attacks in 2017, terrorists killed 80 people.  \n \nHuman rights problems continue to occur in Kenya, including corruption, \npolitically-motivated killings, forced disappearances, torture, and harsh prison conditions.  \nViolations of privacy, restrictions on freedom of the press and assembly, and violence \nagainst women continue to occur. \n \nSomalia and Kenya \n \nWhile Department Counsel has no burden or obligation to present such evidence, \nI agree with Applicant\u2019s observation that there is no evidence of record that the \ngovernments of Somalia and Kenya engage in the following activities: (1) spy on the \nUnited States or commit espionage against the United States; and (2) encourage or \nsponsor terrorism.  There is no record evidence that terrorists use residents of Kenya or \nSomalia to coerce their relatives in the United States to breach U.S. security. The \nprimary foreign influence security concern in Somalia and Kenya arises from terrorism \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \nand criminal activity and not from espionage from the governments of those two \ncountries.  Terrorists are known to conduct sophisticated and aggressive espionage. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant admitted that his half brother is a citizen and resident of Somalia, and \nhis sister is a citizen and resident of Kenya. There are widely documented safety issues \nfor residents of Somalia and Kenya primarily because of terrorists, criminals, and \ninsurgents, and Applicant\u2019s sister and half brother, like every other resident of those \ncountries, are vulnerable to those dangers. Applicant is willing to voluntarily serve in a \ndangerous location on behalf of the DOD in the future. Numerous linguists, supporting \nU.S. forces, have family living in countries such as Somalia, Kenya, Afghanistan, Iraq, \nPakistan, and Syria. Hundreds of United States and coalition armed forces and civilian \ncontractors serving in those countries are targets of terrorists, along with civilians and \nsoldiers who support the governments in those countries and cooperate with coalition \nforces.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in a country hostile \nto the United States or with a problem with terrorists and insurgents is not, as a matter \nof law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his or her spouse \nhas such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone \nis sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nDec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002)).    \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)). Another significant consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Somalia and Kenya with the United States, and the situation in those \ncountries with terrorists places a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to \ndemonstrate that his relationship with any family member living in or visiting those \ncountries does not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position \n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \nwhere he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire \nto assist a relative living in or visiting Somalia or Kenya.5  \n \nGuideline B security concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United \nStates. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. \nMay 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Somalia or Kenya seek or have sought classified or economic information \nfrom or through Applicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a \npossibility in the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Somalia or Kenya \nhave a significant problem with terrorism. Applicant\u2019s family in Somalia and Kenya \n\u201ccould be a means through which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek \nU.S. information or technology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d \nADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 \nat 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Somalia or Kenya or \nvisiting those countries create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could \nplace pressure on his family in Somalia or Kenya in an effort to cause Applicant to \ncompromise classified information. These relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department \nCounsel produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with his family in \nSomalia and Kenya and have raised the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential \napplication of any mitigating conditions.  \n \n                                            \n5 The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 n. 18 (App. \nBd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security significance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family members in \na foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on their prominence or personal \nsituation. Rather, the issue is whether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country raise security [or trustworthiness] concerns because \nthose ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an \napplicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance [or public trust position]. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure \nexerted on, or through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) and 8(c) apply. Applicant has \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has resided in the United States and since 1998, and \nin 2007, he became a U.S. citizen. His spouse and children are citizens and residents of \nthe United States. He swore an oath of allegiance to the United States as part of the \ncitizenship process. He is willing to serve as a linguist overseas supporting U.S. goals.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s willingness to support the DOD overseas as a linguist and cultural \nadvisor, including the dangers that service entails, weighs towards mitigating security \nconcerns. Applicant seeks a security clearance to enable him to continue to provide \nassistance to DOD possibly in a dangerous environment. He has offered to risk his life \nto support the United States\u2019 goals overseas. His offer of service in a dangerous area of \nthe world shows his patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United States: \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to \nsupport a favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR \nCase No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in \nsupport of U.S. forces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of \ndangerous high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant \ncontribution to national security.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n5, 2008); and ISCR Case No. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2012).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections to Somalia or Kenya are limited as the only family \nmembers living in those countries are his half brother and sister. He does not intend to \ntravel to those countries for personal visits. He does not have property in Somalia or \nKenya. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand residents of Somalia or Kenya. Like every other resident of Somalia or Kenya, his \nrelatives are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human rights violations of the \ngovernments in Somalia or Kenya. \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 historical investment of \nmanpower and money in Somalia and Kenya, and Applicant is willing to support U.S. \ngoals and objectives overseas. Applicant\u2019s relatives living in Somalia and Kenya are \npotential targets of terrorists, and Applicant\u2019s access to classified information could \ntheoretically add risk to his relatives living in those countries from lawless elements.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives living in Somalia and Kenya are \nlimited. His connections to the United States taken together, including his spouse and \nfive children who are U.S. citizens, and his willingness to support U.S. goals in a \n\n \n12                                                                                                                                           \ndangerous environment, are sufficient to overcome the foreign influence security \nconcerns under Guideline B.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuideline B are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old former linguist who wishes to return to linguist duties \noverseas. Pending approval of his security clearance, he is working as an ultrasound \ntechnician. In 1991, he left Somalia, and he has not returned to Somalia for personal \nreasons since then. In 1998, he immigrated to the United States, and in 2007, he \nbecame a U.S. citizen. In 2012, he received an associate\u2019s degree. He owns a home in \nthe United States.   \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Somalia and Kenya must take into \nconsideration the geopolitical situation and dangers there.6 Somalia and Kenya are \ndangerous places because of violence from terrorists, and the Somalia and Kenya \ngovernments do not respect the full spectrum of human rights. Terrorists continue to \nthreaten these governments, the interests of the United States, U.S. Armed Forces, and \nthose who cooperate and assist the United States. The United States, Somalia, and \nKenya governments are allies in the war on terrorism. \n \nApplicant\u2019s half brother is a citizen and resident of Somalia, and he is probably \nretired from the police. The police in Somalia have been the victims of terrorists. His \nsister is a citizen of Somalia and a resident of Kenya. Applicant rarely communicates \nwith his sister, and he communicates with his half brother every few months. He \nprovided about $1,200 to his sister in the last three years or so. He has not been to \n                                            \n6 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). \n\n \n13                                                                                                                                           \nSomalia on personal business in 28 years. His communications and support to his \nfamily in Kenya and Somalia are a manifestation of his care and concern for them. His \nrelationship with his half brother and sister in Somalia and Kenya raise important foreign \ninfluence security concerns. Those connections are balanced against his connections to \nthe United States. Applicant\u2019s spouse and five children are citizens and residents of the \nUnited States, and he owns a home in the United States. He swore allegiance to the \nUnited States and believes he offered to or did renounce his Somali citizenship. \n \nApplicant served U.S. interests as a linguist overseas. He made contributions at \npersonal risk on behalf of U.S. forces. All these circumstances increase the probability \nthat Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist \ngroup, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit him. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). His past honorable service overseas in an environment hostile \nto the United States weighs heavily towards mitigation of foreign influence security \nconcerns. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008) (affirming grant of \nsecurity clearance and commenting \u201cApplicant has served as a translator and as a \ncultural liaison between Americans and Afghan citizens, diffusing tensions and \nfacilitating transactions between the two groups. . . . Applicant put his life in danger on \nat least one occasion to protect American lives and interests in Afghanistan.\u201d). \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole \nperson. I conclude foreign influence security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \nMarch 6, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLokey Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 11, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline K. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 29, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on September 5, \n2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non November 15, 2018, scheduling the hearing for December 4, 2018. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits Government Exhibits 1 \nthrough 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf \nand presented five documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (TR) on December 13, 2018. \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in the SOR under this guideline.  After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old.  He is married, and has one minor son.  He has a \nMaster\u2019s degree in Systems Engineering.  He holds the position of System Test \nEngineer for a defense contractor.   \n \n \n \nApplicant was born in Vietnam in 1981.  He immigrated to the United States in \n1995 with his father and younger brother.  Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen \nin 2003.  (Tr. p. 22.)  He graduated from college with his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006, and \nreceived his Master\u2019s degree in 2012.  He has been employed with his current \nemployer, a defense contractor, since 2008 and has held a security clearance since \nthen.  Applicant testified that since obtaining his security clearance, he has received \nannual security briefings from his employer as a refresher.  (Tr. p. 23.)       \n \n \nWhile working for his current employer, since 2008, Applicant has committed \nthree security violations and/or infractions occurring in 2014, 2016, and 2017.  The first \none occurred in September 2014.  On this occasion, Applicant left classified information \nunattended in violation of his company\u2019s security regulations.  Applicant explained that \nhe had been working late, writing what he calls a test procedure, in a classified room \nwithin a safe lab, known as a secret area, when he wrote several numbers down on a \npiece of paper.  (Tr. p. 24-25.)  He left the piece of paper on the table.  Another \nindividual came in the following morning and found the piece of paper with the numbers \non it and reported it to company security department.  While conducting their \ninvestigation, they determined that no one had accessed the area since Applicant left.  \n(Tr. p. 26.)  Following this security infraction, Applicant was interviewed by the security \ndepartment and he was required to provide a written statement about the incident and \nreceived a security infraction that was placed in his company personnel file.  He was \nalso required to take and complete the annual security training immediately after the \nincident.  (Tr. p 27.)      \n \n \nThe second security violation occurred in November 2016.  Applicant stated that \nhe was the response engineer for a test procedure in an unclassified program \ndocument.  He had been working on the document for some time and had made several \nrevisions, updates to the procedures, and put numbers to the procedure.  At some point, \nit was discovered by the customer that Applicant had included classified information in \nthe document.  (Tr. p. 29.)  The customer sent it to their security department, and it was \ndetermined to be a Code Blue, where there was a mass data containment effort.  \nIndustrial security investigators later confirmed that the classified information in the \nprogram document was compromised.  Following this security violation, Applicant was \ninterviewed by the security department and was required to provide a written statement \nabout the incident, and he received a security violation that was placed his company\u2019s \npersonnel file.   Once again, he was required to take and complete the annual security \ntraining.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s third security violation occurred in or about April 2017.  This time, \nApplicant did not properly check to ensure that the classified safe was properly closed.  \nApplicant explained that he signed an acknowledgment form attesting to the fact that he \nwitnessed his supervisor properly secure a safe holding classified documents.  The \ncompany security department conducted a daily scan and discovered that they were \nable to open the safe, and that it had not been properly secured in violation of company \nsecurity regulations.  Applicant later realized that he had not pulled down the handle to \nensure that it could was properly secured.  Following this security violation, Applicant \nwas interviewed by the security department and was required to provide a written \nstatement about the incident.  He received a security violation that was placed his \ncompany\u2019s personnel file.   Once again, he was required to take and complete the \nannual security training.  \n    \n \nApplicant states that he was never disciplined for any of the three security \ninfractions/violations.  He believes that the first two incidents occurred because he did \nnot understand the information enough to know that it was considered classified.  The \nthird violation he admits occurred because he simply missed it and made a mistake.  \n(Tr. p. 40.) \n \n \nPerformance evaluations of the Applicant for 2015, 2016, and 2017, are \nfavorable and reflect that he is a \u201cTop Performer.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \n \n \nFive letters of recommendation from fellow colleagues and upper management \nwho know and work with the Applicant, namely a Senior Computer Engineer and \ncoworker, a Program Director, an Engineering fellow, and Applicant\u2019s current \nsupervisor, each reflect that they believe Applicant is a dedicated individual who \ndemonstrates a high level of technical capability, integrity, honesty and trustworthiness.  \nApplicant is recommended for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C, D, and \nE.)   \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information is set \nout in AG \u00b6 33:  \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information-raises doubt \nabout an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security \nconcern. \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline notes nine conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 34. Five are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of protected information to \nunauthorized persons, including, but not limited to, personal or business \ncontacts, the media, or persons present at seminars, meetings, or \nconferences; \n \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information; \n \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement; and  \n \n(i) failure to comply with rules or regulations that results in damage to the \nnational security, regardless of whether it was deliberate or negligent. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 35 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 35 including: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training \nand now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security \nresponsibilities; \n \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions; and \n \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no evidence of \ncompromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  As a holder of a security \nclearance and entrusted with working with the Government\u2019s classified information, \nApplicant had a duty to be responsible, careful, and vigilant while protecting classified \ninformation.  In this situation, clearly he was not.  Applicant states that he was not clear \nregarding certain rules and regulations that pertain to classified information.  So \nalthough he did not deliberately intend to commit two of the three security \ninfractions/violations, he was negligent and careless.  He did not go to his company for   \nclarification of the rules, nor did he seek out any other assistance before committing the \nsecurity violations.  This does not show good judgment.    \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline K, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  It is noted \nthat Applicant has received favorable evaluations on the job, and is respected by his \ncolleagues.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Handling Protected Information security \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that Applicant was admitted for inpatient alcohol-detoxification treatment and diagnosed as alcohol dependence in February 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he was admitted for inpatient alcohol-detoxification treatment in June 2016, diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, and advised on discharge to abstain from alcohol (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that Applicant continues to consume alcohol despite his treatment for alcohol dependence/alcohol use disorder (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted the alcohol-detoxification treatments but denied that he continues to drink alcohol. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 43-year-old high school graduate, who has worked for a defense contractor since July 2014. (GE 1.) He is currently a nuclear inspector and holds a DOD secret clearance. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 26-28.) He previously worked as a mechanic for the defense contractor from 2003 to 2006. (Tr. 27.) Applicant was twice married and divorced before he married his current wife in February 2012. He and his spouse separated in 2017 and were in the process of a divorce as of April 2019. Applicant has a 15-year-old daughter, a five-year-old son, and an 11-year- old stepdaughter. (GEs 1-2, 4-5.) Applicant began drinking alcohol at age 20. At age 26, he began drinking on a daily basis.

He continues to drink alcohol against medical advice. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, to all adjudications for national security eligibility or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n \n\n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR allegations on November 6, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On March 12, 2019, the Government indicated the case was ready to proceed to \na hearing. On March 18, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for April 10, 2019, to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. \n \nAt the hearing, six Government exhibits (GEs 1-6) and three Applicant exhibits (AEs \nA-C) were admitted in evidence. Medical records of Applicant\u2019s February 2016 alcohol-\ndetoxification treatment were admitted as GE 4 over Applicant\u2019s objections. Applicant \ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on April 30, 2019.  \n \nI held the record open for two weeks after the hearing for Applicant to submit \nadditional exhibits. No documents were received by the deadline, and the record closed on \nApril 24, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was admitted for inpatient alcohol-detoxification \ntreatment and diagnosed as alcohol dependence in February 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he \nwas admitted for inpatient alcohol-detoxification treatment in June 2016, diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder, and advised on discharge to abstain from alcohol (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and \nthat Applicant continues to consume alcohol despite his treatment for alcohol \ndependence/alcohol use disorder (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations, he admitted the alcohol-detoxification treatments but denied that he continues \nto drink alcohol. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old high school graduate, who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since July 2014. (GE 1.) He is currently a nuclear inspector and holds a DOD \nsecret clearance. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 26-28.) He previously worked as a mechanic for the \ndefense contractor from 2003 to 2006. (Tr. 27.) \n \nApplicant was twice married and divorced before he married his current wife in \nFebruary 2012. He and his spouse separated in 2017 and were in the process of a divorce \nas of April 2019. Applicant has a 15-year-old daughter, a five-year-old son, and an 11-year-\nold stepdaughter. (GEs 1-2, 4-5.) \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol at age 20. At age 26, he began drinking on a daily \nbasis. He received inpatient alcohol treatment for 45 days in 2004. (GE 3.) From March \n2006 to February 2012, Applicant was employed as a parts supervisor. He left the job \nfollowing a disagreement with the owner\u2019s son, and he was unemployed until October \n2013. (GE 1.) \n \nOn February 20, 2013, Applicant had an argument with his spouse that was \noverheard on the telephone by her ex-husband, who came over to the house. Applicant \n\n3 \n \nwas arrested for a disorderly conduct offense,1 but the charge was subsequently dropped. \nHe admits that he had consumed alcohol before the offense, although he denies he was \nintoxicated. (GE 1; Tr. 28.) On February 21, 2013, Applicant went to a substance abuse \ntreatment facility requesting alcohol detoxification and referral to an outpatient treatment \nprogram. He was admitted as an inpatient for medically-monitored alcohol detoxification. At \nintake, he reported that he had consumed whisky the prior evening and that drinking was \nan issue in his current marriage. His judgment and insight were assessed as poor, and he \nwas diagnosed with alcohol dependence and cannabis abuse. He had been smoking \nmarijuana for the past 1.5 years to as recently as February 18, 2013. After completing the \ndetoxification protocol, Applicant was discharged on February 25, 2013, in improved \ncondition. His prognosis was considered good with follow-up in outpatient treatment and \ncontinued involvement in community support programs. (GE 3.) Applicant now claims that \nhe had consumed a couple of beers before his February 2013 arrest; that he was court-\nordered to attend a program offered by the facility consisting of once weekly sessions \ndiscussing \u201ccurrent issues or this or that;\u201d and that he misunderstood the court order and \ncheck himself into the facility instead. (Tr. 29.) Concerning his drinking pattern before that \ndetoxification treatment, Applicant testified, as follows: \n \nI don\u2019t know. I mean, that was a while ago. Nothing\u2014I would say a couple of \nbeers, couple of beers at night or\u2014like I\u2019ve always had\u2014we\u2019ve always had \nalcohol in the house, you known. I mean, maybe some\u2014like a rocks glass of \nJack Daniels if I\u2019m sitting down after the kids are sleeping or keep a sleeve of \nnips2 in the freezer, grab one or two nips or something like that, but \nnothing\u2014an excessive consumption. (Tr. 29-30.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent. However, he then \nstated, \u201cThey diagnose everybody that\u2019s alcohol dependent when they come in there.\u201d3 (Tr. \n30.)  \n \nApplicant was abstinent until sometime in 2014, when he began drinking one beer \nper day while working on his old house. According to available medical records (GE 4), by \nlate 2014 or early 2015, Applicant was consuming half to a full fifth of whiskey or the \nequivalent of 14 nips of alcohol and beers per day, usually in the evenings after work; that \ndrinking pattern persisted for the next 1.5 years; and it was beginning to adversely affect \nhis family life and his work. On June 3, 2016, he was voluntarily admitted for inpatient \nalcohol detoxification to a substance-abuse treatment facility. Records indicate that he \nreported more than a 20-year history of alcohol dependence and an inability to stop \ndrinking. He was taking prescribed Ativan for anxiety issues and was aware of health \nconcerns that could arise from combining that medication with alcohol. Applicant was \n                                                 \n1 Applicant indicated on his SF 86 that he was charged with breach of peace in February 2014. (GE 1.) \nHowever, medical records from February 2013 show that he had a charge of disorderly conduct pending \nfollowing his arrest on February 20, 2013. (GE 3.) \n \n2 Applicant described a nip as 1.5 ounces of alcohol, \u201clike a shot bottle.\u201d (Tr. 30.) \n \n3 Given Applicant\u2019s denial of an alcohol dependency problem, it is likely that he meant to say that everyone that \nis in the facility for alcohol detoxification is diagnosed as alcohol dependent.  \n\n4 \n \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder, moderate. After a medically uncomplicated \ndetoxification, he was discharged on June 6, 2016. A medical notation in the discharge \nsummary indicates that the hospital was unable to keep Applicant against his will. Applicant \nwas advised by his attending physician to abstain completely from alcohol. He was told that \nhe was at high risk of relapse without continued treatment. Applicant was not interested in \na residential program or day program because he wanted to return to work. He expressed \nsome interest in an intensive outpatient program, but then did not participate in an \noutpatient alcohol-treatment program. (GE 4.) \n \n Applicant disputes the medical records indicating that he was drinking a half to one-\nfifth of whiskey or combination of beer and liquor per day, stating, \u201cThat\u2019s not even \npossible.\u201d He testified that if he had an alcohol problem, his inpatient stay would have been \na minimum of seven days because of withdrawal symptoms that occur between the fourth \nand fifth days of detoxification. (Tr. 33.) He claims that he usually had a 12-pack of beer in \nhis refrigerator. He testified that he drank \u201ca couple, two or three beers a day, maybe, like I \nsaid, at night, if I\u2019m working on the house, maybe two\u2014two nips. . . . Three nips. I mean, \nthat\u2019s like maybe three ounces of alcohol, four ounces, if that.\u201d He indicated that he drank \nas much as two or three beers plus two or three nips during the course of an evening only \noccasionally when he had a lot to do and was not paying attention to his drinking. (Tr. 34-\n35.) He could not explain the discrepancy in the accounts of his drinking habits. He was not \naccompanied by anyone when he sought treatment in 2016.  (Tr. 49.) \n \nApplicant asserts that he \u201cpretty much stopped drinking\u201d for a while after his \ninpatient detoxification. (Tr. 36.) He put off following through with any aftercare. It was not a \npriority for him. (Tr. 51.) \n \nOn November 1, 2016, Applicant sought counseling with a licensed alcohol and drug \ncounselor (LADC) affiliated with a private behavioral health practice. He reported that he \nhad last consumed alcohol about two weeks previously. During a session of November 8, \n2016, he indicated that his drinking has been \u201cvery bad\u201d and that he used alcohol to self-\nmedicate while dealing with difficult family issues. He and his spouse had separated. (GE \n5.) He now claims to have no recall of any specific event that precipitated his counseling. \n(Tr. 52.) On November 29, 2016, he told the LADC that he last drank alcohol about two \nweeks before their session. He went to an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting after \nhaving one sip of alcohol. By January 17, 2017, Applicant and his spouse had reconciled. \nApplicant stopping going to counseling at that time. (GE 5.) \n \nBy late April 2017, Applicant and his spouse had separated again. On April 26, \n2017, Applicant returned to the private behavioral health practice and began psychological \ncounseling with a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) for emotional distress caused by \nhis marital separation. At his intake session, Applicant reported that he had last consumed \nalcohol about a month ago, and that he was attending AA meetings twice weekly. He \nexpressed that he was managing his alcohol use. He denied any use of alcohol as of late \nJuly 2017. During a session with the LCSW on August 9, 2017, he reported a decline in his \nAA attendance. (GE 6.) \n \n\n5 \n \nOn August 29, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He responded affirmatively to an \ninquiry concerning whether he had ever voluntarily sought counseling or treatment as a \nresult of his use of alcohol and listed his alcohol detoxification in February 2016 and his \ncounseling with the LCSW, which he indicated started in June 2016. Applicant also \nreported that he had charges of disorderly conduct and interfering with a police officer \npending against him since June 2017 after an argument with his spouse. He stated that the \ncharges would be dropped at his next court date. (GE 1.) A contemporaneous progress \nnote from his treating LCSW indicates that Applicant was \u201csuspected to be intoxicated\u201d on \nthe occasion of his June 2017 arrest. (GE 6.) Applicant testified at his hearing that he was \nordered by the court to obtain an alcohol and drug assessment to determine whether he \nneeded treatment, and that no treatment was recommended. (Tr. 22.)  \n \nIn approximately October 2017, his spouse filed for divorce. By November 2017, \nApplicant was drinking alcohol socially on occasion, although not when his children were in \nhis home. His therapist encouraged him in early November 2017 to attend AA if alcohol \nbecame an issue. (GE 6.) \n \nOn December 5, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He reported his ongoing counseling for stress \ncaused by his marital separation and issues with his children. About the argument with his \nspouse that led to his arrest in June 2017, Applicant explained that he was released by the \npolice so quickly because he was not intoxicated. Applicant was instructed by the court to \ncontinue with his mental health treatment, and the charges were dismissed in September \n2017. About his alcohol-detoxification treatment in February 2016, Applicant stated that he \nvoluntarily attended a two-day inpatient alcohol-detoxification program in an attempt to \nprove to his spouse that he did not have alcohol dependency and to repair his marriage. \nHe related that he had alcohol counseling from the behavioral health provider from June \n2016 to July 2016 [sic] because he wanted to prove to his spouse that he did not have an \nalcohol dependency problem. He claimed that he discontinued the treatment shortly after it \nbegan because his treatment provider determined that he did not have a condition that \nwarranted further treatment. Applicant described his current alcohol use as moderate, and \nindicated that he was drinking two to three beers three to four nights per week after work \nand on the weekends. He also consumed a glass of whiskey at night on occasion. He \ndenied that his drinking had any appreciable effect on his behavior. (GE 2.)  Applicant had \nno answer at his hearing for why he resumed drinking alcohol against medical advice. (Tr. \n39.) \n \nAs of a session with the LCSW in early January 2018, Applicant was hoping to \nreconcile with his spouse. He admitted to having consumed a couple of drinks socially not \nto self-medicate. After a total of 23 sessions with the LCSW focused on his marital issues, \nApplicant was discharged from counseling on February 1, 2018. The LCSW was leaving \nthe practice, and she was in agreement with Applicant that he was ready for discharge. \n(GE 6.) \n \n\n6 \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated on June 15, 2018, that he \nwas drinking two or three beers and one or two drinks of liquor on a weekly basis to as \nrecently as June 10, 2018. He denied that he was currently consuming alcohol to \nintoxication. He responded \u201cNone\u201d to separate inquiries concerning his last date of \nintoxication and last date of blackout. (GE 2.) At his hearing, he testified that he could \nrecall blacking out from drinking only one time, which was at his bachelor\u2019s party in \napproximately 2012. (Tr. 56-57.) \n \n \nIn March 2019, Applicant and his estranged spouse stipulated to sharing joint legal \nand physical custody of their five-year-old son. They agreed that neither Applicant nor his \nspouse would consume alcohol during access with their son. Applicant has his son three \ndays one week and four days the next week. (AE C.) \n \n \nApplicant testified at his April 2019 hearing that he obtained alcohol treatment \u201cmore \nto save [his] marriage than anything,\u201d and added that his drinking was always brought up \nby his spouse\u2019s family as a reason for him and his spouse not to be together. (Tr. 25.) He \nindicated that there was a break in his counseling after his therapist left the practice, but \nshe returned, and he resumed his therapy, which has continued on a weekly basis. (Tr. 22-\n23, 37.) He has not attended an AA meeting in 2019. (Tr. 38, 45.) Applicant testified that \nhis present consumption of alcohol is \u201cvery limited. . . . Maybe two times a week.\u201d He \nconsumed a couple of drinks over the weekend before his hearing when he had company \nfor dinner. (Tr. 42.) After an argument with his estranged spouse a couple of weekends \nbefore his hearing, she complained to the police that he had been drinking around their \nminor child. According to Applicant, the police performed a wellness check and then left \nafter only four minutes. (Tr. 42-43.) Applicant denies that any drinking was involved, and \nasserted that circumstances have been manipulated to \u201cmake it look really bad for him.\u201d He \nclaims to have no recall of the last time he was intoxicated. (Tr. 43.) He was advised by his \nphysician to avoid drinking alcohol because of his anti-anxiety medication. His explanation \nfor not following that advice is that he takes his anti-anxiety medication on an as-needed \nbasis. (Tr. 58.)  \n \n \nApplicant denies that alcohol has had any effect on his work performance, citing his \nmerit and time increases in his pay over the past 4.5 years. (Tr. 25.) Applicant\u2019s current \nsupervisor has worked with Applicant since June 2015. He attests that Applicant has \ndemonstrated such reliability at work that upper management gave Applicant the \nresponsibility of being a closed area custodian of three areas. Applicant is required to \nhandle classified and sensitive information, and he has done so without any infractions. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor has not observed any behavior by Applicant that would cause him to \nlose trust in him, and he highly recommends that Applicant be allowed to retain his nuclear \ninspection and security liaison positions. (AE A.) \n \n \n The supervisor of security services indicates that Applicant\u2019s work as a closed area \ncustodian is in one of the most sensitive areas at their facility. Applicant\u2019s duties in that \nregard include \u201cprotecting and inspecting classified and sensitive information, conducting \ninventory of classified and sensitive information, maintaining control of classified areas, \ntraining employees who work in classified areas and supporting internal and external \n\n7 \n \nsecurity audits.\u201d He attests that Applicant never hesitates to support the security \ndepartment, and he has become an integral member of their team. Applicant has become \n\u201cessential\u201d to their daily operations, and he has been dedicated to his job. (AE B.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n\n8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is articulated in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol at age 20. Available medical records indicate that \nhe began drinking alcohol on a daily basis at age 26. By February 2013, when he was \nadmitted for alcohol-detoxification treatment, his alcohol consumption was causing him \nmarital problems. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence at that time. After a period \nof abstinence, he resumed drinking in 2014, initially one beer per day. In June 2016, he \nvoluntarily admitted himself for inpatient alcohol-detoxification treatment. He was \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder, moderate, and discharged after being safely detoxed \nthree days later. Applicant disputes medical record entries that indicate he was drinking in \nquantity of a half to a fifth of whiskey per day over the 18 months preceding that admission. \nHe claims that he drank only a couple of beers or nips at a sitting, and that he only \noccasionally consumed both the beers and nips. He testified that it would not have been \npossible for him to drink up to a fifth of whiskey per day and report to work. He also \ndisputes the diagnoses of alcohol dependence and alcohol use disorder. He told an OPM \ninvestigator in December 2017 that he sought treatment only to prove to his spouse that he \ndoes not have an alcohol problem. \n \n \nHowever, Applicant testified that he was alone when he sought treatment in June \n2016. It is reasonable to infer he provided the information about his drinking to the clinician. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s alcohol use was clearly an issue in his marriage, and two providers \nthree years apart diagnosed him with an alcohol problem.  There is no recent medical \nassessment in the record indicating that he does not have an alcohol use disorder. \nMoreover, Applicant admitted the detoxification treatments and the diagnoses when he \nanswered the SOR. He is either in denial of his alcohol problem or is deliberately \nminimizing it in an effort to maintain his clearance eligibility. Two disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 22 apply. AG \u00b6 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder,\u201d is established because Applicant was medically \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder, moderate, by his attending physician in June 2016. \nAG \u00b6 22(f), \u201calcohol consumption, which is not in accord with treatment recommendations, \nafter a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder,\u201d is implicated. Applicant continues to consume \nbeer and some liquor after being medically advised in June 2016 to completely abstain \nfrom alcohol, and after being told by his primary care physician that he should not consume \nalcohol while taking his anti-anxiety medication.  \n \n\n9 \n \n \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15 of the Directive, Applicant has the burden to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. AG \u00b6 23 provides for mitigation \nunder the following conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has no \nprevious history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with \nany required aftercare, and has demonstrate a clear and established pattern \nof modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nApplicant may be drinking less now than he did in the 1.5 years preceding his \ninpatient detoxification in June 2016. Nevertheless, his continued consumption against \nmedical advice raises security concerns in that it presents a risk of relapse into \nuncontrolled drinking. Alcohol was involved in his arrest for disorderly conduct in June \n2017. At his hearing, he testified about a more recent incident in approximately late March \n2019 where his spouse accused him of drinking while he had physical custody of their \nyoung son. Applicant denies alcohol was involved on that occasion, and there is no proof to \nthe contrary. At the same time, his present denial of his alcohol problem is the antithesis of \na meaningful acknowledgement of his maladaptive alcohol use. AG \u00b6 23(c) recognizes that \nindividuals with an alcohol problem are to be encouraged to seek treatment without fear \nthat doing so will cost them their job. Applicant\u2019s repeated inpatient detoxifications followed \nby relapse removes AG \u00b6 23(c) from consideration, and makes it difficult to mitigate the \nalcohol consumption security concerns under AG \u00b6 23(d). The absence of any \noccupational consequences from his drinking does not completely eliminate the security \nconcerns about his alcohol consumption. Applicant testified that he resumed his counseling \nafter his therapist returned to the behavioral health practice, but he presented no \ncorroborating documentation that could enlighten about the nature of his present treatment \nand progress. His treatment with his therapist has largely focused on his emotional health \nrelated to his marital issues and family stress and not on his alcohol abuse. He is not \npresently attending AA or other community-based recovery program that could assist him \nto maintain his sobriety. For the reasons noted, the alcohol consumption security concerns \nare not mitigated. \n \n\n10 \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).4 In making the overall commonsense determination required under AG \u00b6 2(a), there is \nno evidence that Applicant ever allowed his abuse of alcohol to negatively affect his work \nperformance. Even so, the Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need \nnot wait until an applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before \ndenying or revoking security clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. \nBd. Oct. 29, 2009) (citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is \nwell settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). At some future \ndate, Applicant may be able to show reform for a sufficiently sustained period to safely \nconclude that his maladaptive use of alcohol is safely in the past. For the reasons \ndiscussed, it would be premature to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility at this \ntime. \n   \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant5 \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n                                                 \n4 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows:  \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n5 A favorable finding is returned as to SOR \u00b6 1.a because treatment is viewed favorably, especially when it is \nvoluntary, and there is no history of treatment and relapse. SOR \u00b6 1.b is resolved against Applicant because of \nthe serious relapse triggering the need for detoxification after a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. \n\n11 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 40 years old. He is married with one child. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since April 2007. He attended college for approximately three years, but did not receive a degree.1 The SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency from approximately June 1998 to April 2017. In October 2017, he admitted to a defense investigator that he used marijuana about once every three months from June 1998 to January 2017 (which post-dated the completion of his SCA). He further described his use of marijuana as using it with friends or family in their homes. He claims to have stopped his use when his wife became pregnant (no date in the record for this event). He further claims he will not use marijuana in the future. In April 2018, when he completed interrogatories sent to him concerning this case, he was unable to recall the dates of his use of marijuana.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. The DOD CAF \nacted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 28, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \n02/25/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 8, 2018. The evidence \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 3-4 (Items 1-2 include pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on August \n14 (or 19), 2018. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not file any objections nor \nsubmit any additional evidence. Items 3-4 are admitted into evidence without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 30, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted the allegation in the SOR. I adopt his \nadmission as a finding of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. He is married with one child. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer, a federal contractor, since April 2007. He attended college for \napproximately three years, but did not receive a degree.1   \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency from \napproximately June 1998 to April 2017. In October 2017, he admitted to a defense \ninvestigator that he used marijuana about once every three months from June 1998 to \nJanuary 2017 (which post-dated the completion of his SCA). He further described his \nuse of marijuana as using it with friends or family in their homes. He claims to have \nstopped his use when his wife became pregnant (no date in the record for this event). \nHe further claims he will not use marijuana in the future. In April 2018, when he \ncompleted interrogatories sent to him concerning this case, he was unable to recall the \ndates of his use of marijuana. His employer has a workplace drug policy that comports \nwith the \u201cDrug-Free Work Force rules issued by the DOD.\u201d Since Applicant submitted \nthis case for an administrative determination, I was not able to judge his credibility \nbased on demeanor.2 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n                                                          \n1 Item 3. \n \n2 Items 3-4. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n\n \n4 \n \n \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One condition is potentially applicable in this case, to wit: \n \n(a) any substance misuse. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on multiple occasions between 1998 and 2017. I find \nthat the above disqualifying condition applies. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \n \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \n \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana was frequent and, given his 20-year-pattern of use, \nhis claimed abstinence beginning in 2017 is not sufficiently attenuated to be considered \nremote. Even more troubling than his frequent use was his use after he completed his \nSCA. He stated he will not use in the future, but based on his past actions, it is difficult \nto lend credence to such stated intention. He did not provide a signed statement of \nintent abstaining from all future illegal drug use, which acknowledged any future misuse \nwould be grounds for revocation of his security clearance eligibility. Applicant\u2019s short \nabstention is insufficient to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. His frequency of \npast use and his use of marijuana after completing his SCA cast doubt upon his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not apply. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.         \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that he used marijuana \nregularly for a 20-year period and he used marijuana after completing his SCA.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement and substance misuse.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph    1.a: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 4, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 28, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.

The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 12, 2018. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled on November 6, 2018.

He denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.h through 1.l, 1.n, and 1.p. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree and recently started \nworking on a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has never been married. He has four children. He \nhas twins who are 22 years old from a former relationship. He has two children ages 11 \nand 9-years-old from a former relationship who live with their mother. Applicant has been \nemployed by a federal contractor since August 2016. He has been consistently employed \nand has not disclosed periods of unemployment.2 \n \n \nApplicant was previously employed by a state agency from August 2015 until \nAugust 2016. In January 2016, he was involved in a serious car accident while working. \nHe did not collect unemployment benefits. He testified he did not receive any pay after \nthe accident. He filed a claim for worker\u2019s compensation. During this time, he fell behind \non his child support payments.3  \n \nApplicant testified he had to take his employer to court to receive compensation \nfor his accident. He provided a copy of a settlement agreement with his employer \nadministered through the compensation claims division of the state. The settlement \nagreement stated that it was a complete and final release, and waiver of all medical \nbenefits which Applicant might be entitled from his former employer. The employer agreed \nto pay a lump sum of $7,500, inclusive of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. It noted that Applicant \nunderstood that this payment would settle his entitlement to all classifications of medical \nbenefits. It highlighted that the settlement specifically included any and all outstanding \nmedical bills, either currently known or unknown to the parties, as well as outstanding \nmedical bills owed to various entities that provided medical services incurred by Applicant \nas result of the accident. The agreement stated that Applicant agreed that he will be solely \nresponsible for payment of such bills and holds the employer harmless from any liability. \nThe indemnity portion of the claim was previously settled. Out of the $7,500, Applicant \n                                                          \n1 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I is the exhibit list and II is the discovery letter. HE II is the exhibit list. HE III is \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s memorandum noting he had not objections to Applicant\u2019s documents.  \n \n2 Tr. 19-25. \n \n3 Tr. 23-25. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwas to pay his attorney $1,250 and other court fees. His net recovery was $6,181. \nApplicant signed the agreement before a notary on July 28, 2018.4 \n \nApplicant stated that the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.n \nwere to be paid by his employer. He explained that when his accident occurred he learned \nthat the contract for medical insurance had lapsed and the state would pay only $10,000 \nfor his medical debts. He testified that his attorney told him his medical bills would be \npaid. He said he believed his medical bills were covered by worker\u2019s compensation. He \nused some of his settlement payment to pay child support.5  \n \nApplicant disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m on his October \n2018 credit report. He testified he hired a law firm to dispute his debts. The credit report \nconfirms that these accounts are being disputed. No determination was made as to the \nvalidity of the debts. Applicant testified that he paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m ($329). I find \nin his favor on these debts. He testified that he paid the debt in SOR 1.p ($200) and would \nprovide documentation. He did not. This debt is not resolved.6  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he no longer has to pay child support as of March 2017 for \nhis twin children. He said he is paying the arrearages owed (SOR \u00b61.a-$15,065). He said \nhe was paying $1,000 a month toward the amount owed. He provided a document that \nshows he made payments of $244 twice in September 2018, four payments of $244 in \nOctober 2018, and a payment of $244 in November 2018. The document shows that as \nof November 2018, the total arrears owed is $5,466. His intention was to complete paying \nthis arrearage and then begin paying the arrearages for his other two children (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c-$12,313) and make the full payments. He provided a document from the state where \nthey reside that shows the current balance of his arrearage is $16,822. The document \nshowed he made $200 payments in April, May, June, August, September, and February \n2017. In March 2017, he made two payments of $200 and one payment of $1,360. The \nchild support order requires him to pay $660 a month. He understands that each month \nhe is deficient in amount of his payments. Applicant testified when he received his \nsettlement payment, he paid about $5,000 toward child support.7 \n \n \nApplicant provided a document to show he made a payment of $107 in May 2018 \nfor the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.q ($249). There is still a balance owed. He also provided a \npayment receipt showing that he made a $50 and $23 payment on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nThe account lists a remaining balance of $281. These debts are not resolved.8  \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 61-72; AE A. It was apparent from Applicant\u2019s testimony that he is confused about terms of his \nsettlement. \n \n5 Tr. 61-82.  \n \n6 Tr. 55-78. \n \n7 Tr. 25-51; AE B. Applicant\u2019s children live in two different states.  \n \n8 Tr. 58-61; AE C. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s October 2017 background investigation, he disclosed he purchased \na vehicle in about 2011 and then could not afford the payments.9 He testified that the \nvehicle was repossessed (SOR \u00b6 1.b-$13,013) in 2014. He told the investigator that once \nhe caught up on child support payments, he would pay $20 a month on the repossessed \nvehicle. He testified that he contacted the creditor in August 2018 to see if the balance \ncould be reduced. They did not respond. He has not contacted the creditor again. He \nintends to pay the debt in the future. The debt is not resolved.10  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g was for an apartment in which he \nlived with the mother of his younger children in about 2013 or 2014. When they separated, \nhe broke the lease. During his background investigation, he told the government \ninvestigator that he would begin paying $35 a month within 30 days to resolve the debt. \nHe testified that he does not have the resources to pay this debt at this time, but had \ncontacted the creditor and advised them he would pay it. He admits the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.o has been delinquent since about 2015, and was not paid.11 The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g \nand 1.o are unresolved.  \n \n \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions, \ndocuments, and credit reports from September 2017 and October 2018.12 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that he is attending school so he can get a better job and earn \nmore money. He has approximately $41,000 in student loans that are deferred. He began \nincurring the student loans in 2008.13  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n                                                          \n9 At the hearing, Applicant testified he purchased the vehicle in 2013 or 2014. GE 3, a September 2017 \ncredit report shows the account was open in 2011. \n \n10 Tr. 51-55. GE 2, 3. 4. \n \n11 Tr. 82-88; GE 2. \n \n12 GE 1, 2, 3, 4; AE A, B, C, D.  \n \n13 Tr. 88-97. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that began accruing in approximately \n2013 and continue to date. He also has two child-support arrearages. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a serious accident that occurred in \nJanuary 2016 while at work. There was a dispute about his medical coverage. Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsettled with his employer and received a payment. The settlement waived Applicant\u2019s \nclaim regarding past or future medical debts. Applicant got behind on his child support \npayments during this period. However, prior to the accident, Applicant had other \ndelinquent debts beginning in 2013 that he had not paid. Applicant\u2019s debts are recent and \nongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s accident was beyond his control. The issues with his employer\u2019s \nmedical insurance coverage were also beyond his control. Applicant had numerous \ndelinquent debts prior to his accident. Those were within his control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant accepted a settlement agreement for his medical debts. He said \nhe used some of the settlement to pay child-support arrearages. Some of his debts were \nincurred years before his accident. He did not provide sufficient evidence to show he is \nresolving most of his delinquent debt. He did provide some evidence to show he has \nmade payments toward one child-support arrearage, but each month he is delinquent on \nthe other. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application.  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he has participated in financial counseling \nor that he established a budget from which to determine financial stability. There are not \nclear indications that the financial problems are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant provided proof that he made two payments in September 2018 on the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, but there is still a balance owed. He also provided proof that he made a partial \npayment on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.q in May 2018, but no further payments were made. As \nthe result of Applicant\u2019s inconsistent payments, AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply to these debts. \nApplicant has been making consistent payments toward one child\u2019s support arrearages, \nindicating a good-faith effort to resolve that debt. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a. He \ncontinues to be delinquent each month on his other child-support payments. AG \u00b6 20(d) \ndoes not apply to the other debts.  \n \n \nApplicant disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m, which are \nreflected as such on his October 2018 credit report. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to these debts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. He has debts for a repossessed vehicle and early \ntermination for a lease that occurred in approximately 2013 or 2014, before his accident. \nHe agreed to a settlement from his employer which waived their responsibility to pay his \npast or future medical debts. He disputed some debts on his credit report. His child-\nsupport arrearages continue to be a concern. Although he stated that he intends to \nresolve his delinquent debts in the future, at this juncture, he has an unreliable financial \ntrack record. He has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.m \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.q: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines L (Outside \nActivities), B (Foreign Influence), and C (Foreign Preference). Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 10, \n2017. On August 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guidelines L, B, and C. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 18, 2018, and requested a decision \non the written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \n04/05/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment\u2019s written case on January 31, 2019. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on February 6, 2019, and submitted a response, which is marked \nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX ) A. The case was assigned to me on March 12, 2019.  \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The request and supporting documents were \nnot admitted in evidence but are attached to the record as FORM Item 6. I took \nadministrative notice as requested by Department Counsel. In addition, I have taken \nadministrative notice, with no objection from either party, of the facts published by the \nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, in U.S. Relations with United \nArab Emirates (September 13, 2018), available at www.state.gov and included in the \nrecord as FORM Item 7. The facts administratively noticed are set out below in my \nfindings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n2.b. He admitted \u00b6 3.a in part. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from January 1988 to \nFebruary 2008, retired as a technical sergeant, and received an honorable discharge. \nHe held a security clearance while on active duty and retained it as a defense \ncontractor.  \n \n \nApplicant married in September 1988, divorced in October 1997, and married his \ncurrent spouse in August 2011. His current and former spouses are citizens and \nresidents of the United States. He has an adult daughter from his first marriage, who is \na citizen and resident of the United States. \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old owner, president, and chief executive officer of a \ndefense contractor. He is a citizen and resident of the United States. His company does \nbusiness in the Middle East and is a partner in a joint venture in the United Arab \nEmirates (UAE). The joint venture provides training, support, operations consulting, and \nprofessional services to governmental and military entities in the UAE. His business \npartner in the joint venture is a citizen and resident of the UAE, and they have quarterly \ntelephonic contact. Their last face-to-face contact was in June 2016. The current \nmemorandum of agreement creating the joint venture expires in May 2019. \n \nThe joint venture had a one-year contract in 2015-2016 that provided human \nresource services for a project in the UAE. The gross value of the contract was about \n$3,000,000. The services provided were professional services for edged-impact-\n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (FORM Item 2) \nunless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nweaponry-training services, the design of bladed weapons, and the development of \nsporting-tournament programs. The involvement with UAE did not include classified \ninformation, special nuclear material, U.S. export-controlled commodities, technical \nknow-how, or technical data. (Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, attached to \nItem 2.) \n \nApplicant has been unable to compete for or perform defense contracts in the \nUnited States until his company\u2019s facility clearance is reactivated, and it cannot be \nreactivated until his security clearance is adjudicated. In January 2017, the Defense \nSecurity Service (DSS) reviewed the joint venture\u2019s facility clearance and determined \nthat joint venture is not under foreign ownership, control, or influence that requires \nmitigation. (DSS Letter of Jan. 4, 2017, attached to Item 2.) Applicant\u2019s foreign business \nactivities have not been limited to the UAE. The record reflects that he also has done \nbusiness in Italy and Australia. (Item 2 at 36; Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, \nattached to Item 3.) His contacts with these countries are not alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nIn order to facilitate the operation of his joint venture in the UAE, Applicant has a \nbank account in the UAE. When he was interviewed by a security investigator in May \n2017, there was no money in the account. (Personal Subject Interview (PSI), attached \nto SOR Answer.) When he responded to interrogatories in April 2018, the account had \nthe minimum balance required to remain open. He holds an active UAE driver\u2019s license, \nwhich he needs in order to drive in the UAE if he remains in the UAE for more than 30 \ndays. He held a UAE identity card, which expired in July 2018, and he does not intend \nto renew it. He held a UAE gate-entry card that expired in July 2017. \n \n \nThe UAE is a federation of monarchies consisting of seven emirates. The rules of \nthe emirates constitute the Federal Supreme Council, the country\u2019s highest legislative \nand executive body. The emirates are under patriarchal rule with political allegiance \ndefined by loyalty to tribal leaders, leaders of individual emirates, and leaders of the \nfederation. The United States has had friendly relations with the UAE since its formation \nin 1971. The UAE has an influential role in the Middle East and is a key partner for the \nUnited States. The two countries enjoy strong bilateral cooperation on many issues, \nincluding defense. UAE ports host more U.S. Navy ships than anywhere else outside \nthe United States. \n \n \nThe UAE is a regional and global financial and transportation hub, and terrorist \norganizations exploit it send and receive financial support. It is a drug-transshipment \npoint for illegal traffickers and its position as a major financial center makes it vulnerable \nto money laundering. There have been numerous instances in which U.S. dual-use and \nmilitary components have been shipped to Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan through the UAE, \nusing methods making it appear that UAE was the final destination. \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State regards two emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, as \nmedium-threat locations for terrorist activity directed at or affecting U.S. Government \ninterests. The UAE\u2019s participation in the anti-ISIS coalition and the Yemen civil war has \nincreased the likelihood of terrorist attacks against Western interests. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe UAE maintains effective control over its security forces. The most significant \nhuman-rights issues have involved allegations of torture in detention, arbitrary arrest \nand detention, government interference with privacy rights, restrictions on assembly and \nassociation, and the inability of citizens to choose their government in free and fair \nelections. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n5 \n \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).  \n  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline L, Outside Activities \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is a business partner in a joint venture that is \nincorporated and doing business in the UAE. AG \u00b6 36 expresses the security concern \npertaining to outside activities: \u201cInvolvement in certain types of outside employment or \nactivities is of security concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual's \nsecurity responsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized disclosure of \nclassified information.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 37 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) any employment or service, whether compensated or volunteer, with:  \n(1) the government of a foreign country;  \n(2) any foreign national, organization, or other entity;  \n(3) a representative of any foreign interest; and, \n(4) any foreign, domestic, or international organization or person \nengaged in analysis, discussion, or publication of material on intelligence, \ndefense, foreign affairs, or protected technology; \n(b) failure to report or fully disclose an outside activity when this is \nrequired.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s joint venture in the UAE is sufficient to establish AG \u00b6 37(a)(2). AG \u00b6 \n37(b) is not established, because there is no evidence that Applicant has failed to \nreport or fully disclose his activity as required. \nAG \u00b6 38 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) evaluation of the outside employment or activity by the appropriate \nsecurity or counterintelligence office indicates that it does not pose a \nconflict with an individual's security responsibilities or with the national \nsecurity interests of the United States; and, \n(b) the individual terminated the employment or discontinued the activity \nupon being notified that it was in conflict with his or her security \nresponsibilities. \n \nAG \u00b6 38(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s involvement with the UAE does not involve \nclassified information, nuclear materials, or export-controlled commodities, or protected \ntechnical knowledge or data. His company was cleared by DSS. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 38(b) is not yet established, but it will be applicable when the current \nmemorandum of agreement expires in May 2019. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s business partner is a citizen and resident of the \nUAE (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and that Applicant has a bank account in the UAE (SOR \u00b6 2.b). The \nsecurity concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology; and \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(f) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nliving or having business associates or business interests subject to a foreign \ngovernment. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the \neconomic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States. In considering the nature of the government, an \nadministrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See \ngenerally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to \ngrant clearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area \nwhere family members resided). \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(f) are established. Applicant\u2019s relationship with his \nbusiness partner appears to be an arms-length impersonal relationship. The record \ncontains no evidence regarding the reliability or trustworthiness of Applicant\u2019s partner. \nThe joint venture has not involved sensitive or classified information or materials. \nHowever, the risk of terrorism, the activities of drug traffickers, and the exploitation of \nthe UAE as an illegal transshipment point for dual-use and protected military equipment \n\n \n8 \n \nare sufficient to establish the \u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(f) and the potential \nconflict of interest in AG \u00b6 7(b).  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. The record contains insufficient information to \nevaluate the nature of Applicant\u2019s relationship with his business partner. The UAE\u2019s \nvulnerability to terrorism, exploitation by illegal drug traffickers, money laundering, and \nillegal transshipment of dual-use and military equipment preclude a finding that a future \nconflict of interest is unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s ties to the UAE are strictly commercial. His \nonly business associate in the UAE is his partner. There is no evidence that he has any \nclose friends in the UAE. He and his immediate family are life-long citizens and \nresidents of the United States. He served honorably in the U.S. Air Force for 20 years. \nHe has held a security clearance for many years without incident. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s quarterly contacts with his partner in the \nUAE are arguably infrequent, but they are business-related and not casual. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) is established. Applicant\u2019s last contract with the UAE was substantial, \nbut he has no current contracts. His UAE bank account has a minimal balance. His \nmemorandum of agreement with the UAE expires in May 2019.  \n\n \n9 \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant holds an active UAE identity card, UAE driver\u2019s \nlicense, and a UAE gate card (SOR \u00b6 3.a). Applicant has refuted the allegations that he \nhas an active UAE identity card and gate card. He admits that he has an active UAE \ndriver\u2019s license. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 9:  \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \n \n \nThe relevant potentially disqualifying conditions are: \n \nAG \u00b6 10(b): failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an \nappropriate security official, the possession of a passport or identity card \nissued by any country other than the United States; \n \nAG \u00b6 10(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of \nemployment, position, or political office in a foreign \ngovernment or military organization; and \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign \nperson, group, organization, or government in any way that \nconflicts with U.S. national security interests; \n \n \nNeither disqualifying condition is established. There is no allegation or evidence \nthat Applicant failed to disclose his possession of a UAE identity card when required. \nThere is no evidence that he assumed or attempted to assume any position in the UAE \ngovernment or military and no evidence that he acted to serve the interests of any entity \nin a way that conflicted with U.S. national security interests. \n \n\n \n10 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines L, B, and C in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines L, B, and C, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his participation in a joint venture in the UAE. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline L, Outside Activities: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n Statement of the Case \nOn April 22, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn March 23, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information; \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines issued by the Director of National \nIntelligence, effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017.1 \n1 GE 1, 3. \n01/07/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 11, 2018. He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h. \nHe denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, claiming \u201cidentity fraud.\u201d He did not submit any \ndocumentation. He requested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on \nthe written record in lieu of a hearing.2  \n \n \nOn May 9, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. \nA complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six items, was \nmailed to Applicant on July 10, 2018. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation \nwithin 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. He \ndid not object to Items 1 through 6, which I marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, \nand admitted into evidence. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nassigned the case to me on September 14, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact:  Applicant is 36 years old. He has \nbeen employed full time with a Federal contractor since March 2013. He is divorced and \nhas no children. He is requesting national security eligibility.3  \n \nApplicant reported two of the alleged SOR delinquent debts on his April 2017 \nSCA; the debt at \u00b6 1.f, which he listed as \u201copened without his knowledge,\u201d and the debt \nat \u00b6 1.g, a delinquent medical account he overlooked and intended to pay. During his \nbackground interview conducted in December 2017, Applicant reported to the \ninvestigator that he had been a victim of identity theft that occurred in December 2016. \nAt that time he was made aware that there were several accounts opened under his \nname that were delinquent. Applicant claimed these accounts were related to the \nidentity theft and he would take action with the creditors and credit reporting agency to \nprevent additional fraudulent activity.4  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent accounts totaling approximately $21,463.00, \nwhich are supported by credit reports submitted by the Government.5 The record \nestablishes the status of Applicant\u2019s accounts as follows:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a credit card debt charged off in the amount of $10,879. In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant denied this account and listed \u201cIdentity Fraud.\u201d He \n                                                          \n2 GE 2. \n \n3 GE 3. \n \n4 GE 1, 3, 4. \n \n5 GE 5, 6. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfailed to provide any documentation to support his claim.

In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant denied this account and listed \u201cIdentity Fraud.\u201d He \nfailed to provide any documentation to support his claim. This debt has not been \nresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a credit card debt charged off in the amount of $2,458. In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant denied this account and listed \u201cIdentity Fraud.\u201d He \nfailed to provide any documentation to support his claim. This debt has not been \nresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a credit card debt charged off in the amount of $2,110. In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant denied this account and listed \u201cIdentity Fraud.\u201d He \nfailed to provide any documentation to support his claim. This debt has not been \nresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a credit card debt charged off in the amount of $1,212. In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant denied this account and listed \u201cIdentity Fraud.\u201d He \nfailed to provide any documentation to support his claim. This debt has not been \nresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a delinquent account referred for collection in the amount of \n$1,543. In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied this account and listed \u201cIdentity \nFraud.\u201d He made the same assertion in his SCA. He failed to provide any \ndocumentation to support his claim. This debt has not been resolved.  \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.g, an unpaid medical account referred for collection \nin the amount of $475. He did not provide any information to indicate that he is either \npaying, paid, or in the process of resolving this debt. This debt has not been resolved. \n \nApplicant also admitted SOR \u00b6 1.h, a utility account referred for collection in the \namount of $100. In his response to the SOR, Applicant listed that this account was paid. \nThe debt is supported by a 2017 and 2018 credit bureau reports. Applicant failed to \nprovide evidence to show that this debt is paid. The debt has not been resolved.  \n \nDepartment Counsel noted in her brief, in bold print, that: \u201cIt is the Applicant\u2019s \nburden to mitigate the security concerns established by the disqualifying \nconditions above. In order to do so, the Applicant must provide documentary \nevidence\u2026\u201d Despite the clear warning to Applicant, he did not submit any mitigating \ndocumentation within the 30-day time period after receipt of the Government FORM. He \ndid not provide documentation sent to the credit reporting companies or creditors \nshowing he disputed the negative entries. He did not provide copies of police reports \ndocumenting claims of identity theft. He did not provide information concerning a budget \n\n \n4 \n \n \nor other information related to his financial obligations from which to determine his \ncurrent financial circumstances.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has approximately $21,000 of delinquent debt that is unpaid and \nunresolved, as shown on his credit reports. In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. \nJan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence to apply any of the mitigating conditions. Applicant \ndisputed six of the eight delinquent accounts alleged in his SOR due to claimed identity \ntheft in about December 2016. Despite a clear statement to Applicant in the \nGovernment\u2019s brief, he did not provide any supporting documentation to verify his claim. \nApplicant has not provided any evidence to show that his disputes with creditors are \nlegitimate, or provide proof of his communication with these creditors in an effort to \nresolve the fraudulent accounts. Applicant admitted responsibility for two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g-1.h), and he listed that the last account had been paid. He failed to provide any \nevidence to show that he is paying, resolving, or has paid either of those debts. There is \nno evidence to show Applicant received financial counseling or that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances in dealing with his creditors.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a position of trust with the Government. An applicant is \nnot required to be debt-free, but is required to manage his finances to meet his financial \nobligations. \n \n \nApplicant claims that he is a victim of identity theft. He failed to provide \nsupporting documentation and he failed to demonstrate that he acted reasonably under \nthe circumstances in dealing with his creditors. There is no showing by Applicant of any \neffort to pay, legitimately dispute, or otherwise resolve any of the financial security \nconcerns. Applicant has not provided a financial plan or a detailed budget of his current \nfinancial circumstances. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s good \njudgment, reliability as well as eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Because \nprotection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any \nunresolved doubts must be resolved against the granting of eligibility to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                \n \n            \n \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Tr. 9-10, \n25, 27, 29-31, 33-34, 111)  \n \nApplicant had some financial issues when he served on active duty in the U.S. \nArmy. (Tr. at 28; GE 3) His current financial issues are related to several periods of \nvoluntary and involuntary unemployment.1 In 2015, while his wife was a full-time student, \nApplicant was laid off from his employer. She graduated in 2015, and then he went back \nto school. He testified that they mismanaged their finances during this period, but they \nnow follow a budget. (Tr. 36, 41) \n \nApplicant disclosed in his July 2016 SCA that he had two mortgage accounts that \nwere in foreclosure status. The two accounts were for two separate homes in State A. He \ndid not disclose any other debts in his SCA. (GE 1 at 37) During Applicant\u2019s November \n2017 personal subject interview, he was confronted with the numerous, substantial, and \nsignificant debts. (GE 2) Many of these debts were alleged in the SOR. \n \nThere are 27 debts alleged in the SOR, and they total over $73,000.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a was a mortgage debt. In 1999, Applicant and his wife purchased a home \nfor approximately $90,000 (Home 1). Their monthly mortgage payment was \napproximately $550, and they were current on their payments for many years. In 2007, \nthey decided to purchase a new home due to the deterioration of their neighborhood and \nthe birth of their children. (Tr. at 38-39, 45, 48) \n \nApplicant and his wife were unable to sell Home 1 before they purchased a second \nhome (Home 2). Home 1 was worth $40,000 when they tried to sell it, but they still owed \n$70,000. They were able to rent Home 1 for several years and cover the mortgage \npayment. In 2015, they were unable to rent Home 1. Shortly thereafter, Applicant and his \nwife both found jobs in State B. As a result, Applicant and his wife attempted to sell both \nhomes. They stopped making payments for Home 1 in May 2014, and about six or seven \nmonths later foreclosure proceedings were initiated. The bank sold Home 1 for $20,000. \nApplicant does not owe any money for this property. (Tr. 37-45, 49, 52; GE 2 at 5; GE 4 \nat 5) \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant was unemployed during the following periods: November 2015 until June 2016; May 2014 until \nJune 2015; December 2011 until June 2012; and April 2007 until June 2007 He spent this time acclimating \nto civilian life and being with his family. \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b was a mortgage debt. In 2007, Applicant and his wife purchased Home \n2 for $237,000. Their mortgage payment was approximately $1,700. This was a 30-year \nfixed mortgage through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). At the time that they \npurchased Home 2, they were earning approximately $55 per hour collectively. Applicant \nand his wife stopped making payments in approximately August 2014 due to a lack of \nsufficient income. Applicant and his wife moved from State A to State B in May 2015. \nShortly thereafter, the home was foreclosed upon and at that time the outstanding \nmortgage was $200,000. The home was later sold by the bank for $85,000. Applicant \ndoes not owe any money for this home. (Tr. 37, 45-47, 50-52; GE 2 at 5) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a $15,914 car loan and a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.r. In 2009, Applicant \npurchased a 2007 car for approximately $27,000. The monthly payment was over $500. \nApplicant and his wife made payments until they moved from State A to State B in 2015. \nThey left the vehicle in State A while they lived in State B from May 2015 until July 2016, \nwhen Applicant and his family moved back to State A. They voluntarily returned the \nvehicle to the dealer in approximately April 2017. The outstanding balance is $14,340. \nApplicant has not made payments toward this debt since he moved to State B in May \n2015, but he contacted the creditor in April 2018. (Tr. 19-22, 52-58, 61-64; GE 2 at 6; GE \n4 at 3; GE 5 at 3; AE E; AE F) \n \nApplicant and his wife purchased two used vehicles during the fall of 2017. He is \ncurrently driving a 2013 truck that he purchased for $22,000. His wife drives a 2011 car \nthat they purchased for $25,000. Their aggregate monthly payments are approximately \n$1,000. (Tr. 59-60) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a $10,504 student loan that Applicant deferred while he was on active \nduty. After he left active duty, he made payments for several years until he experienced \nfinancial issues due to unemployment. In 2016, Applicant made four or five $70 payments. \nHe started making automatic $55 monthly payments in April 2018. Applicant testified that \nin May 2018, he also made five weekly payments of $150, which were automatically \ndeducted from his paycheck. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d has decreased to $8,948, \nand it was successfully rehabilitated after the hearing. (Tr. 17-18, 64-69, 100; GE 5; AE \nC; GE 2 at 6; GE 4 at 3; GE ; AE D; AE I) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a fourteen-year-old $3,733 credit card debt that remains unpaid. (Tr. \n70-71; GE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, 1.k, are student loans totaling $9,188. None of these debts \nappear as delinquent on Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR). Applicant believes they \nare duplicates of SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Tr. 17-18, 64-69, 100; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; AE B at 1) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.l are 2014 veterinary debts totaling $3,267 for Applicant\u2019s family \ndog. The debts were incurred in 2015.

Applicant believes he paid the debt, but he did not provide proof \nof resolution. (Tr. 70-71, 78-79; GE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 5) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m is the $824 annual maintenance fee for a timeshare Applicant and his \nwife inherited from her mother. Applicant paid the fee prior to their family vacation in \nFebruary 2018. (Tr. 74-78; GE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 9) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n is a $576 credit card debt that Applicant opened in 2011 and last made \npayments toward in 2013. He has not made payments, nor is it resolved. (Tr. 79; GE 2 at \n5; GE 4 at 4) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o is a 2015 $525 cable-related debt. Applicant has not made contact with \nthe creditor, nor is it resolved. (Tr. 79-80; GE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 9) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.w total $847, and they are car rental bills that Applicant\u2019s former \ncar insurance company was supposed to pay. He disputed both of these debts with his \ninsurance company. (Tr. 80-82; GE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 10) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.q is an $815 judgment filed against Applicant in July 2012. He believed \nthis was originally a medical debt, and he has not made payments. (Tr. 82; GE 2 at 5; GE \n4 at 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.s is a $2,767 debt related to Applicant\u2019s 2015 railroad certificate. He has \nnot contacted the company, disputed it, nor paid it. (Tr. 83-84; GE 2 at 6; GE 4 at 5) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t and 1.u are medical debts totaling $2,852, and they were placed for \ncollection in 2014. He contacted the collector before August 2018, but has not made any \npayments toward either debt. (Tr. 84-88; GE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 9) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.v is a 2016 $485 propane debt that Applicant disputed because he has \nnever held a propane account. (Tr. 88-89; GE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 10) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.x and 1.aa are medical bills totaling $542. They were incurred in 2013 \nand 2015 for his children when Applicant and his wife were in school. He has not made \npayments toward either debt. (Tr. 89-90; GE 4 at 10-11) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.y is a $369 parking fine from 2015. He has not paid this debt. (Tr. 90-91; \nGE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 10) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.z is $222 debt for an internet service. Applicant has a current account \nwith this company; therefore, he believes the collection is inaccurate. (Tr. 91-92; GE 2 at \n5) \n \nApplicant follows a written budget. In May 2018, he paid $500 to retain a credit-\ncounseling service, but it is unclear which of the alleged debts were included in the plan, \nnor has he made any payments into the plan. Applicant and his wife owe an unspecified \n\n \n5 \n \namount to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax year 2017. He and his wife have not \nyet established a payment plan. (Tr. 22-24, 96-99; AE G) \n \nApplicant received a Good Conduct Medal, multiple Army Achievement Medals, a \nCombat Infantryman\u2019s badge, an Iraq Campaign Medal, and other awards and \ndecorations during his service in the U.S. Army. (Tr. at 30-32) He does not have a history \nof disciplinary issues while on active duty or at subsequent employers. (Tr. at 35) \nApplicant submitted four letters of recommendation reflecting his positive reputation, \nknowledge, hard work, professionalism, strong sense of duty, and high moral character. \n(AE H) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n\n \n6 \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant experienced personal financial issues arising from voluntary and \ninvoluntary unemployment. He recently sought credit counseling to resolve his debts in a \nresponsible manner, but he has not established a payment plan. He recently rehabilitated \nhis student loan. However, Applicant has numerous unresolved debts. In 2016, he was \nconfronted regarding most of the alleged debts. Since his interview, he has not \nestablished payment plans for any of his non-student loan debts; therefore, he only \nreceives partial credit for AG \u00b6 20(d). Additionally, Applicant owes money to the IRS for \ntax year 2017, and he has not established a payment plan or resolved the debt. \n \nAlthough Applicant follows a budget, he did not establish that he is able to live \nwithin his means, nor has he shown that he have acted responsibly to resolve his \noutstanding delinquent debt in a timely manner. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), \n20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) was not established.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \n\n \n8 \n \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \n \nI conclude Applicant did not meet his burden of proof and persuasion. He failed to \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f - 1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h - 1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j - 1.k: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n - 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.s - 1.u:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.v - 1.w:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.x - 1.y:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.z:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.aa:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 30, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. DOD acted under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 25, 2018, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice of hearing on February 28, 2019, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on March 8, 2019. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered exhibits \n\n \n2 \n \n(AE) A though C, which were admitted without objection. The record was kept open until \nApril 30, 2019, and Applicant submitted AE D through H, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 5, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR at hearing to add an additional \nallegation under Guideline F. Applicant was given the choice to proceed to hearing with \nthe amended allegation or request a continuance, which I would grant, to allow him at \nleast 15 days to prepare for the new allegation. He chose to proceed with the hearing \non the condition that I leave the record open to allow him to present additional evidence \non any allegation and in particular the amended allegation. I granted the motion to \namend and I also kept the record open until April 30, 2019. The new SOR allegation is \nidentified as \u00b6 1.e and reads as follows: \u201cYou are indebted to [school name] for a \ndelinquent debt that was charged off in the amount of $1,216. The status of the debt is \nunknown.\u201d1 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the Guideline F allegations (except \u00b6 1.e, which was \nneither admitted nor denied) and those admissions are incorporated into these findings \nof fact. He denied the Guideline E allegation. After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in October 2016. He served in the Air Force from 2001 until 2003 as a \nsecurity forces airmen (military police) when he was discharged under other than \nhonorable conditions (UOTHC). He held a security clearance before his discharge. His \ndischarge was so characterized because he received Article 15 UCMJ punishment from \nhis commander for having an adulterous affair with the spouse of another military \nmember. He has a high school diploma and has completed several college (technical) \ncourses resulting in him receiving information technology (IT) certifications. He is \nmarried (since 2001) and has one son, age 17.2 \n \n \nThe SOR (and subsequent amendment) alleged three delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $2,624 (no amount was alleged for SOR \u00b6 1.d). The debts were listed in \ncredit reports from February 2017 and March 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.e). The SOR also \nalleged Applicant failed to file his federal tax returns for tax years 2014-2016. It was \nfurther alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to list his 2015 marijuana use when \nasked if he had used any illegal drug or controlled substance within the past seven \nyears on his December 5, 2016 security clearance application (SCA). He stated \u201cno\u201d to \nthe question on his SCA. (SOR \u00b6 2.a).3 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 16-22. \n \n2 Tr. at 34-35, 41, 47; GE 1-2 (Personal Subject Interview-September 2017). \n \n3 GE 3-4. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2018s financial difficulties began in approximately 2013. His wife worked as \nthe family\u2019s sole means of financial support. Applicant remained at home caring for their \nson who has emotional and social issues that manifest in behavioral problems. \nApplicant\u2019s wife worked in the commercial transportation industry and made \napproximately $30 per hour. In late 2013 and early 2014, Applicant\u2019s wife suffered from \nmedical issues that restricted her ability to work and caused her to use Family Medical \nLeave in February 2014. She was unable to return to work until August 2015. She \nreceived six weeks\u2019 worth of short-term disability pay in 2014. Applicant began working \nat a convenience store to assist with the family finances. He attended school at night \nseeking certifications in the IT field. In 2015 he was hired in an IT position. They \naccrued medical debts during Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s period of illness. Those debts were not \nspecifically identified in the record.4  \n \n \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b (consumer debt)-$548. Applicant presented documentation showing \nthat this debt was settled in full in April 2019. This debt is resolved.5 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c (medical debt)-$860. Applicant incurred this medical debt from a \nmotorcycle accident he was in. He presented documentation showing that this debt was \npaid in February 2016. This debt is resolved.6  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d (consumer debt). Applicant incurred this debt in the amount of \napproximately $1,000 for a gaming computer. In April 2019, he arranged to have $50 \nmonthly payments made from his bank account by electronic funds transfers (EFT) for \n21 months to pay this debt. This debt is being resolved.7 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e (college course debt)-$1,216. Applicant incurred this debt when he \nenrolled in a course that his employer agreed to pay for on the condition that Applicant \nachieved at least a \u201cB\u201d grade in the course. He failed to achieve a \u201cB\u201d and was required \nto pay for the course himself. He negotiated a settlement with the creditor, which has \nhim making a $611 payment on April 30, 2019, and a $300 payment on May 30, 2019. \nNo proof of payment was submitted. This debt is being resolved.8 \n \n \nApplicant claimed that the reason he did not timely file his 2014-2016 tax returns \nwas because his brother-in-law, who is not a tax professional, told him that if he is due a \nrefund, he did not have to file his tax returns by the April 15 annual deadline. \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n4 Tr. at 23-24; AE C. \n \n5 Tr. at 25; AE E. \n \n6 Tr. at 25; AE G. \n \n7 Tr. at 26; AE F. \n \n8 Tr. at 26-27; AE H. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAdditionally, his wife had prepared their tax returns in the past and because of her \nhealth issues and her job situation, she was overwhelmed and the tax returns for 2014-\n2016 were not timely filed. In 2018, a friend helped prepare their missing tax returns \nusing tax preparation software. The 2014 tax return shows no filing date, but Applicant \ntestified that it was filed in April 2018. The 2015 tax return was filed March 2, 2018 and \nthe 2016 tax return was filed April 2, 2018. Applicant also stated that their 2017 tax \nreturn was timely filed in April 2018. 9 \n \n \n \nIn Section 23 of his December 5, 2016 SCA, Applicant was asked, \u201cIn the last \nseven years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substance?\u201d He responded \nby checking the \u201cNo\u201d option. In September 2017, when interviewed by an investigator \nduring his background check, Applicant was again asked if he used any drugs or \ncontrolled substances in the last seven years. He responded with a \u201cNo\u201d answer. He \nwas then asked again by the investigator if he had ever used illegal drugs. Applicant \nresponded by asking if the investigator meant \u201cever?\u201d The investigator clarified that he \nmeant had Applicant used illegal drugs in the past seven years. Applicant responded to \nthis question with an affirmative response and explained that he had used marijuana in \nDecember 2015 when a friend gave him a small amount.10   \n \n \nApplicant claimed during his hearing testimony that when he answered the \nquestion in his SCA that he had \u201ca lot going on with my family and my personal life.\u201d He \nalso claimed he misunderstood the question and thought it was asking if he used illegal \ndrugs as a manager or supervisor. He then claimed he came forward during his \nbackground investigation and admitted his use of marijuana in December 2015. He \nfailed to mention that he initially denied such use to the investigator and it was only after \nthe investigator repeated the question and clarified it that Applicant admitted to the \nmarijuana use. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony to be not credible.11 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 33, 36, 49-50; GE 2 (Answers to Interrogatories- April 18, 2018). \n \n10 GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview-September 2017). \n \n11 Tr. at 27-29, 42. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n\n \n6 \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts that remain unpaid or unresolved. He also failed \nto timely file his 2014-2016 federal tax returns. I find all the above disqualifying \nconditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant either paid or has set up payment plans for his four delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable to his debts. Concerning his taxes, while his wife\u2019s medical \nissues were beyond their control, Applicant did not take responsible action to timely file \nhis 2014-2016 tax returns. His delay in filing until in either March or April 2018, shows a \nlack of reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(g) partially \napply. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant intentionally omitted information about his 2015 marijuana use when he \ncompleted his SCA. I do not find credible his explanation that he was overwhelmed at \nthe time he completed his SCA or that he misunderstood the question. He held a \nsecurity clearance while in the Air Force so he had filled out a SCA before and was \nfamiliar with the process. I conclude that he intentionally withheld this information when \nhe completed his SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.   \n \nApplicant failed to disclose his marijuana use when he was initially asked about \npast drug use by the investigator during his background interview. Upon further \nquestioning on the subject, Applicant finally admitted his use. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not \napply. Honestly completing an SCA is the initial crucial step in gaining access to \nclassified information. The Government expects, and must rely on, the honesty of \napplicants during this process. Therefore, providing false information at this stage is not \na minor offense. Such deliberate action casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply.  \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s medical conditions resulting in limited employment \nfor her and their son\u2019s behavioral issues. However, I also considered his untimely efforts \nto resolve file his 2014-2016 tax returns. He also deliberately failed to list his 2015 \nmarijuana use on his SCA. Both issues cause me to question his trustworthiness, \nreliability, and good judgment.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations or the personal \nconduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph:   1.a: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.b-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph:   2.a: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

He refuted the \nallegation that he failed to disclose his delinquent debts on his May 11, 2016 \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application \n(SCA) with intent to deceive. (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) Personal conduct security \nconcerns are refuted; however, financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.      \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 11, 2016, Applicant completed and signed an SCA. (GE 1) On April 3, \n2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \nissued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \n04/23/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR \nset forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations and personal \nconduct guidelines. \n \nApplicant provided an undated response to the SOR. (HE 3) Applicant requested \na hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 15-16) On June 27, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed. From July 13, 2018, to February 6, 2019, the case was assigned to other \nadministrative judges, and on February 7, 2019, the case was transferred to me for \nadministrative reasons. On July 16, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s hearing for August 17, 2018. (HE 1A) On \nDecember 31, 2018, DOHA issued a notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s hearing for January \n17, 2019. (HE 1B) The hearing was delayed at Applicant\u2019s request for medical reasons. \n(HE 1C) On February 19, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for \nMarch 8, 2019. (HE 1D) The hearing was held as scheduled using video teleconference.  \n  \nDepartment Counsel offered seven exhibits; Applicant did not offer any exhibits; \nthere were no objections to the documents; and they were admitted into evidence. (Tr. \n20-24; GE 1-7) On March 19, 2019, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.). The record was initially scheduled to close on April 10, 2019. (Tr. 93-94, 101) I \ngranted an extension at Applicant\u2019s request until April 22, 2019. (HE 4) Applicant did not \nprovide any post-hearing exhibits.    \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to withdraw SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.o because the \nallegations were duplicated elsewhere in the SOR. (Tr. 16) Applicant did not object, and \nI granted the motion. (Tr. 17) I made a notation on the SOR documenting my decision. \n(Tr. 17; HE 2) \n \nApplicant said he sent some materials to Department Counsel; however, the \ndocuments were not received. (Transcript (Tr.) 13) I asked Applicant to send them to \nDepartment Counsel and myself via email. (Tr. 13-14; HE 5) On April 20, 2019, I reminded \nApplicant that I had not received any documentation from him and that his suspense was \non April 22, 2019. (HE 5) \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.k, \nand 1.v. (HE 3) Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old pilot and maintenance specialist for unmanned aerial \nvehicles (aircraft piloted by remote control or onboard computers) and drones. (Tr. 7-8, \n25) He has worked for the same government contractor since July 2014. (Tr. 25) He \nserved in the Air Force for almost 28 years, and he honorably retired from the Air Force \nReserve in 2008 as a master sergeant. (Tr. 8, 28) He served in Panama in Operation Just \nCause, in Southwest Asia in Desert Shield/Desert Storm, in Kosovo, Iraq, and \nAfghanistan. (Tr. 8-9) His most recent deployments have been to Iraq and Africa. (Tr. 26)  \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nIn 1981, Applicant graduated from high school, and in 2003, he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in management. (Tr. 7-8) In 1997, he married, and in 2014, he \ndivorced. (Tr. 9-10) His children are ages 12 and 14. (Tr. 10)   \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his spouse\u2019s failure to maintain his \nfinances while he was deployed overseas. (Tr. 19) She used illegal drugs. (Tr. 38) She \nfailed to make payments on two houses, and they were lost to foreclosure. (Tr. 38) After \nthey divorced in 2014, Applicant\u2019s spouse did not pay her share of marital debts. Around \nthe time of his divorce, he owed his brother $50,000 \u201cand some other people.\u201d (Tr. 29) \nApplicant was deployed in 2015 when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) started \ngarnishing his pay, and that is when he first learned he had problems with his federal \nincome taxes. (Tr. 74) Applicant has been in the United States without being deployed \noverseas since March 2017. (Tr. 26) He was injured during his last deployment. (Tr. 26) \nHis current annual salary is about $105,000. (Tr. 27) He has custody of his children; \nhowever, he does not receive any child support from his former spouse. (Tr. 29-30) \n \n \nFrom May 2011 to May 2015, Applicant was not deployed, except for some brief \ntrips overseas. (Tr. 91) He was employed in fracking for almost two years in the United \nStates. (Tr. 31, 91) He was mostly deployed from May 2015 to March 2017. (Tr. 92)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges the following financial issues: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a mortgage account that went to foreclosure and resulted in a \ndeficiency balance of $21,525. Applicant said he was overseas when his residence and \na rental property were foreclosed. He denied that he owed anything, and he said he \nreceived a letter from the creditor indicating he did not owe the debt. (Tr. 40) Applicant\u2019s \nMarch 6, 2018 Equifax credit report shows the $21,525 as a \u201cpast due\u201d amount; the \naccount became delinquent in 2012; and the property was sold. (GE 3) His December 31, \n2018 Equifax credit report does not list this debt. (GE 2)   \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f allege delinquent utility accounts for $1,671 and $551. \nApplicant said his wife paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f around 2010 or 2011. (Tr. \n41-42, 48-49) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.l , 1.s, 1.t, and 1.u, allege eight medical debts placed \nfor collection for $1,125, $969, $759, $480, $81, $2,715, $917, and $711. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k \nand 1.v allege delinquent medical debts for $84 and $93. Over the last five years, \nApplicant has received some medical treatments. Around 2015, he was taken by \nambulance to a hospital for emergency treatment. (Tr. 43) He did not have documentation \non the ten medical SOR debts, or if he did, he did not provide it. When he contacted the \nmedical providers, they were unable to locate supporting documentation. (Tr. 45, 51, 68-\n69) He wanted to determine whether the bills were for himself or his former spouse. (Tr. \n45-47, 58-59) He had medical insurance, and he wanted to determine whether the \nmedical bills were his responsibility or the responsibility of his insurance. (Tr. 46-47, 58) \nHe believed he paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.v for $81 and $93; however, he was \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nunable to obtain documentation showing payment. (Tr. 59, 69) Applicant accepted \nresponsibility for the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.s for $2,715, and the creditor offered to \nsettle the debt for $735. (Tr. 66-67) He was waiting for the creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.s to send \nhim a settlement bill. (Tr. 67)  None of the 10 medical debts were shown on his December \n31, 2018 Equifax credit report. (Tr. 48; GE 2) Applicant is credited with resolving all of the \nmedical debts except for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.s, which he admitted was unresolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.m allege miscellaneous delinquent debts for $295, $245, \n$205, and $3,415. Applicant said he successfully disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. (Tr. 52-\n54) He did not think the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j were legitimate debts, and he \ncontacted the original creditors. (Tr. 55-57) He did not understand why the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j were on his credit report. (Tr. 55-57) Applicant said he did not owe the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.m because his former spouse improperly opened the account without his \npermission. (Tr. 60) He said the creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.m is pursuing his former spouse for \npayment of the debt. (Tr. 61) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p alleges a mortgage account was foreclosed in 2011. Applicant said the \nforeclosure was actually in 2012. (Tr. 61) His spouse received a check from the creditor \nfor $3,800. (Tr. 62) He blamed his spouse for not paying the mortgage while he was \ndeployed. (Tr. 63-64) He believed the creditor owed him money from the sale of his \nresidence. (Tr. 63) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q, and 1.r allege two bank debts owed to the same bank, which were \nplaced for collection for $8,624 and $4,577. Applicant contacted the creditor and learned \nthere were two accounts; however, he believed one of them was his spouse\u2019s \nresponsibility. (Tr. 64-65) He believed the smaller debt was his responsibility. (Tr. 65) He \ndid not provide any evidence of payments to address either debt. (Tr. 66) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.w alleges a charged-off bank debt for $17,797. Applicant contacted the \ncreditor, and in December 2018, the creditor offered to settle the debt for $8,000. (Tr. 70-\n71) Applicant accepted the settlement offer; however, he wanted to resolve the IRS debt \nfirst. (Tr. 72)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.x alleges a federal tax lien filed in November 2014 for $20,711. Applicant \nsaid his spouse lied to him about filing their tax returns for tax years 2007 to 2014. (Tr. \n19, 31, 73) She had a power of attorney. (Tr. 73) Applicant was \u201ctaking home $16,000 a \nmonth\u201d while he was deployed overseas. (Tr. 73) He deployed overseas, and the IRS \nbegan garnishing his pay. (Tr. 31) After he learned about his tax problems, he hired a tax \ncompany to work on his taxes. (Tr. 31) The tax company lost his documentation, and in \n2016, he stopped working with the tax company that lost his documentation. (Tr. 31, 76)  \n \nIn April 2018, Applicant sought the assistance of an expert in tax-exempt status \nand contractor taxes. (Tr. 19, 32, 38) He believed the IRS owed him refunds because \nsome of his income overseas was tax exempt. (Tr. 32) The expert was unable to timely \ncomplete his tax returns because Applicant\u2019s documentation was in storage. (Tr. 33) He \ndescribed his tax situation as a \u201cbig mess\u201d and asserted he is contacting his creditors to \n\u201cclear everything up.\u201d (Tr. 20, 34)  \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nApplicant intended to file or refile his federal income tax returns for 2007 to 2014, \nand he plans to file his tax returns for 2015, 2016, and 2017. (Tr. 35-36, 79) He filed tax \nreturns for tax years 2007 to 2014 in the beginning of 2016. (Tr. 80) He also filed a tax \nreturn in 2015 for tax year 2014. (Tr. 79) He was reluctant to file his tax returns for tax \nyears 2015, 2016, and 2017 because the IRS might take his refunds to address the \n$20,000 debt that Applicant believed was erroneous. (Tr. 37) He believed the IRS \nerroneously believed he made a profit on his home that was foreclosed. (Tr. 81) He said \nthe IRS owed him $100,000 to $120,000. (Tr. 79) He wanted to file everything together. \n(Tr. 38, 75) \n \nI requested that Applicant provide the following documents: his IRS tax account \ntranscripts;1 his DD Form 214; the IRS power of attorney he gave to his spouse to file his \ntax returns without his knowledge; proof of any payments, payment plans, or settlement \nnegotiations relating to any SOR creditors; and a recent credit report from the three major \ncredit reporting companies. (Tr. 93-94) I explained that he could also provide performance \nevaluations, awards, letters of recommendation, and any other documentation that he \nbelieved would help him obtain reinstatement of his security clearance. (Tr. 96) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 11, 2016 SCA asked about his delinquent debts including debts \nin collections and charged-off debts in the previous seven years. Applicant denied that he \nhad debts meeting this criteria; however, in the comments sections of his SCA he said \nhis spouse \u201cdid not pay bills, caused all financial issues to include foreclosure, bad debts, \nnot paying income taxes or filing income taxes for many years. I have taken steps to \nresolve all the financial issues and clear my bad credit.\u201d (GE 1 at 33-34) He disclosed his \ndelinquent tax debt of $21,000, for tax year 2014, and he said it was satisfied in April \n2016. (Tr. 89; GE 1 at 30) He said, \u201cI have filed and [am] paying installments to correct \nthe issue currently. I have an install[ment] agreement with the IRS and [am] completing \nthem currently.\u201d (GE 1 at 30) He said he was unaware of his delinquent debts when he \ncompleted his May 11, 2016 SCA. (Tr. 83) He had difficulty completing the security \nclearance application while deployed overseas due, in part, to problems with the Internet \nand saving the document. (Tr. 84)  \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s June 1, 2017 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal \nsubject interview (PSI), Applicant volunteered that his spouse failed to file and pay their \nfederal income taxes in the amount of $21,000 for tax year 2014. (Tr. 92) He said he was \nmaking monthly payments to the IRS of $428, and his payments would be complete in \ntwo months. (Tr. 92; GE 7 at 6-7) He was unable to provide the status of numerous \ndelinquent debts the OPM investigator asked him about during this PSI. (GE 7) \n \n \n \n                                            \n1 An Applicant\u2019s failure to provide requested, available tax documentation, including IRS-generated \nfederal income tax transcripts, can undermine mitigation of tax debts. See ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018). \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) \na history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required.\u201d The SOR alleges and the record established the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about \nthe possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \nSeven mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;2   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \n                                            \n2 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in \norder to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nNo mitigating conditions fully apply to all SOR allegations; however, Applicant \npresented some important mitigating information about his finances. Several \ncircumstances that were partially or fully beyond his control adversely affected his \nfinances or filing of tax returns: (1) he was deployed overseas to combat or conflict areas; \n(2) his spouse lied to him about paying debts and/or filing his tax returns; (3) his spouse \ndid not pay his share of marital debts; (4) he was divorced in 2014; and (5) these multiple \nfactors cumulatively caused his delinquent debts or distracted him from taking care of his \nfinances.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR indicates all several delinquent debts are in charged-off status on \nhis credit report. A \u201ccharged-off debt\u201d is an accounting entry. A creditor considers a debt \nowed to the creditor to be an asset. When the value of the asset is in doubt, the creditor \nis required to change the status of the debt to reflect its current status. When the debt \nappears to be uncollectible, the creditor should change the status for accounting purposes \nfrom being an asset to charged-off status. Notwithstanding the change to charged-off \nstatus, a creditor may still sell the debt to a collection agent, and the debtor may still pay \nor settle the debt. Eventually, the charged-off debts will be dropped from the debtor\u2019s \ncredit report. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not \nmeaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, \n2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit \nReporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items from a credit report seven \nyears from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because \nof a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer.3 Debts may be dropped from a credit \nreport upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid, a creditor fails \nto timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for information, or when the \ndebt has been charged off. \u201cMere evidence that debts no longer appear on credit reports \nis not reason to believe that they are not legitimate or that they have been satisfactorily \nresolved.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02941 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. \n14-03747 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2015)).  \n \nApplicant was overseas when his residence and a rental property were foreclosed. \nThe foreclosures were his spouse\u2019s fault because she did not make the mortgage \npayments. He indicated at least one foreclosure occurred in 2012, and from then on he \nwas on clear notice that his spouse could not handle his finances. I have credited \nApplicant with mitigating the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.q, 1.t, 1.u, and 1.v. His spouse \nmight be responsible for the debts; they might be the responsibility of his medical \ninsurance; and/or they might be paid. \n \n                                            \n3Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit \nReporting Act Updates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-\nact.pdf. \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for three substantial debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r ($4,577), \n1.s ($2,715), and 1.w ($17,797). He said he had some settlement discussions with these \ncreditors; however, he had not reached any settlements or made any payments. He did \nnot make sufficient progress addressing these three debts.    \n \n Applicant did not establish that he had filed all required federal income tax \nreturns.4 The DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the \napplicant\u2019s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent \nsuch problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness in light of [applicant\u2019s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01031 at 3 and n. 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d \napproach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d \n                                            \n4 Applicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that he did not timely file some of his federal income tax returns. \nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in \nwhich conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-\n00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file some of his federal income tax returns will not be considered except for the \nfive purposes listed above. \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nanalysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus \non timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nApplicant failed to timely file some of his federal income tax returns. It is unclear \nhow much he owes the IRS. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations, . . . \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . . .\u201d5 Applicant\u2019s May 11, 2016 \nSCA asked about his delinquent debts including debts in collections and charged-off \ndebts in the previous seven years. He answered, \u201cno,\u201d and denied that he had debts \nmeeting this criteria. His answers to these questions are incorrect. \n \nOn his May 11, 2016 SCA in the comments sections, Applicant disclosed his \nfinancial problems, including a \u201cforeclosure, bad debts, not paying income taxes or filing \nincome taxes for many years.\u201d Although he did not provide a list of his delinquent debts, \nhe did highlight to security officials that he had significant financial problems. He honestly \nand sincerely believed his answers to questions on the SCA were accurate. He did not \nintend to deceive security officials about his financial predicament. He has refuted the \nallegation that he intentionally failed to disclose information, and he intended to deceive \nsecurity officials about his finances. Personal conduct security concerns are refuted. \n \n \n \n                                            \n5 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden \nof persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old pilot and maintenance specialist for unmanned aerial \nvehicles and drones. He served in the Air Force for almost 28 years, and he honorably \nretired from the Air Force Reserve in 2008 as a master sergeant. He served in Panama \nfor Operation Just Cause, in Southwest Asia for Desert Shield/Desert Storm, in Kosovo, \nIraq, Africa, and Afghanistan. In 2003, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in management. \nIn 1997, he married, and in 2014, he divorced. He has custody of his children, who are \nages 12 and 14.    \n \nFive circumstances that were partially or fully beyond his control adversely affected \nhis finances or filing of tax returns: (1) he was deployed overseas to combat or conflict \nareas; (2) his spouse lied to him about paying debts and/or filing his tax returns; (3) his \nspouse did not pay her share of marital debts after their divorce in 2014; (4) he was \ndivorced in 2014; and (5) these multiple factors cumulatively caused his delinquent debts \nor distracted him from taking care of his finances. Applicant is credited with mitigation of \nmost of the SOR debts.   \n \nMost importantly, Applicant has a history of delinquent federal income taxes. He \nadmitted a tax debt from taxes for tax year 2014 of over $20,000. The IRS garnished his \npay. He revealed he had not filed his tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017.6 \nWhen an issue involving taxes arises, an administrative judge is required to consider how \n                                            \n6 See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents \nan obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information.\u201d). \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \nthe tax debt arose and the payment history on the tax debt.7 Applicant did not provide a \ngood reason for failing to act more aggressively to address his delinquent debts and \nunfiled tax returns once he returned to the United States in March 2017.   \n \n I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are refuted; however, financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.q:   \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r and 1.s: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.t, 1.u, and 1.v:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.w and 1.x: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n                                            \n7 See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance \nand stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only \nafter his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd.

More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and \ncited applicant\u2019s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns \nfor tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except \nfor $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income \nof over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse\u2019s medical \nproblems. The Appeal Board emphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first \nplace stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and \nsystems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

He requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on February 20, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on April 1, 2019, for a hearing on June 20, 2019.The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits (GX) \n1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \npresented two witnesses, and offered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A through H, which were \nadmitted into the record. The record was held open until July 8, 2019. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 1, 2018.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old. He works as a project manager for a defense contractor. \nHe is single and has no children. He graduated from high school and received his \nundergraduate degree in 2005. Applicant reported no military service. He has held a \nsecurity clearance since about 2009. (GX 1) He has been employed with his current \nemployer for about three years. However, he has worked for many government agencies. \nHe completed his most recent security clearance application in 2017. (GX 1, AX A) \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nIn September 2016, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of \nmarijuana and concealing. (SOR 1.a) He was stopped by a police officer for swerving on \nthe road. The officer, according to the report, noticed that Applicant had thrown out of the \nvehicle a small white tissue. (GX 5) The officer smelled marijuana as he was talking to \nApplicant. The police report stated that Applicant admitted that he had been smoking \nsome marijuana earlier with a friend. (GX 5) The officer noted in the report that he saw a \n\u201cgreen leafy like substance on Applicant\u2019s shirt and some on the passenger seat.\u201d  The \nsmall white tissue was tested and found positive for marijuana as well as the tissue that \nhad been thrown out of car. (GX 5) Applicant held a security clearance at the time. \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated that he was with a friend who asked him to hold \nsome marijuana for him. (Tr. 59) Applicant initially told the friend that he does not use \nmarijuana any more. When Applicant was driving home he saw that his friend had left a \nsmall bag of marijuana on the car seat. (Tr. 60) Applicant called his friend and was told \nthat his friend would pick it up in the morning. The officer smelled marijuana coming from \nthe vehicle. Before the actual stop, Applicant saw the police sirens and threw the bag of \nmarijuana out of the car. (Tr. 61) Applicant claims that he explained to the officer that he \ndoes not use drugs. Applicant claims that the officer attempted to make a deal with \nApplicant. If Applicant would disclose the owner of the marijuana, he would dismiss \ncharges. The report, however, noted that Applicant told the officer that he had been using \nsome marijuana. Applicant now denies that he made that statement. (GX 5) (Tr. 64) As a \nresult of the incident, the officer released him. Applicant reported the incident to his FSO. \n(AX F)   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.b, in February 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving \nwhile intoxicated, first offense. (GX 4, 6) He reports that he left a sports bar and was \nstopped by the police when he made a turn that crossed a yellow line. Applicant attempted \na breathalyzer test and performed routine tests. He reports that he was taken to a holding \ncell. When he used the breathalyzer, he registered a .08. (Tr. 58) When Applicant \nappeared in court, the charge was dropped to reckless driving. (GX 6)  He pled not guilty \nand received a suspended 12 month sentence. (GX 4) He completed the required drug \nand alcohol classes. (GX 3) \n \n \nIn September 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of \nmarijuana. (SOR 1.c) He admitted that he was racing his motorcycle on the highway and \nthe motorcycle crashed into a wall. The police had been chasing him and found marijuana    \nin his motorcycle. Applicant told the police that he had loaned his bike to a friend earlier \nin the day and did not know the marijuana was there that belonged to a friend. (Tr. 55) \nApplicant was detained in jail overnight and posted bail. When he went to court, the   \ncharge was reduced to nolle prossed due to insufficient evidence. (GX 3) He was required \nto attend six weeks of ASAP classes. In 2006, when he arrived for the ASAP classes, he \ntested positive for marijuana. (GX 3) Due to the untimely loss of his mother on September \n2001, the judge ordered grief counseling as well. He has not taken any other drug or \nalcohol classes. (Tr. 66)  \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.d, in December 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with illegal \npossession of marijuana (misdemeanor). (GX4, 7) At the time, he was 20 years old. He \nand a friend drove to a party. Before entering, Applicant and the friend were parked in \nfront of the house and were smoking marijuana. An officer pulled up and smelled a strong \nodor of marijuana from the car. Applicant had concealed the bag of marijuana under the \nseat. Applicant\u2019s friend stated the marijuana belonged to Applicant. Applicant retained an \nattorney and the case was dismissed and adjudication deferred. (GX 4) Applicant was \nordered to attend drug and alcohol classes. (GX 3) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana in college as an experiment. (Tr. 52) He \nbelieves he used between 2000 and 2005 at parties and on weekends.  He also stated \nthat he bought marijuana on one occasion. After he graduated from college, he did not \nuse marijuana or any other drug. (Tr. 53) At the hearing, Applicant stated that he knows \nit is a privilege to hold a security clearance and that he takes it seriously. He stated that \nhe no longer associates with anyone who uses marijuana. However, he stated that in \n2016, he held marijuana for a friend. \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s 2018 investigative interview, he explained that he drinks \nperhaps two or three beers a month. He does not even consider himself a social drinker. \n(Tr. 53) He admits that he has made mistakes and immature decisions. \n \n \nApplicant is involved in many sports activities and has progressed in his career \npath. He states that he knows he has to be responsible for his own behavior and the use \nof marijuana or any drug would be a dishonor to his mother. (Tr. 57) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe Statement of Reasons cross alleged the criminal conduct under Guideline H, \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse.  Applicant admitted the allegations as alleged \nunder 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d. \n \n \nTwo witnesses testified for Applicant. The first witness, who is retired, held a \nsecurity clearance for many years. She has known him for 20 years, and has acted as a \nsurrogate mother to him as his mother was killed on September 11, 2001. His father is \nalso deceased. The witness knew Applicant and his family through church. She described \nApplicant as a reliable, honest, dependable person who is a hard worker. (Tr. 22) The \nwitness has never seen Applicant use marijuana. She was not aware of the 2016 arrest \nlisted in the SOR until right before the hearing.  \n \nThe second witness has been dating Applicant since 2008. She revealed that \nApplicant told her of the three arrests from 2003, 2005, and 2008. They have been living \ntogether for about five or six years. (Tr. 30) She stated that she has never seen any \nmarijuana in the house nor has she seen him smoke. As to alcohol, he drinks if they are \nout. (Tr. 32) She testified that Applicant does not use marijuana. She does not know the \nfriend who gave him marijuana. (Tr. 38) She testified that there is no alcohol in the house. \n \nApplicant submitted a letter from a licensed clinical psychologist who worked with \nhim for about 8 sessions from 2005 to 2006. He was referred for problems related to grief \nand his adjustment to losing his mother in the terrorist attack at the Pentagon in 2001. He \nparticipated actively in the sessions.  (GX 3) \n \nHe submitted seven letters of recommendation. Each letter attests to his honesty \nand trustworthiness. All the declarations describe Applicant as a person who is career \noriented and has never displayed any misconduct in the workplace. (AX B-H) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n  \nApplicant had four arrests between 2003 and 2016. Three arrests involved \nmarijuana and one involved alcohol. The last arrest in 2016 involved marijuana. Applicant \nheld a security clearance at the time of the 2016 arrest. The evidence establishes two \ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant has mitigated the security concern under this guideline. He has \ntaken alcohol and drug education classes. He has had no recurrence of incidents \nsince 2016. He attended therapy sessions in 2006. He has excelled in his career. \nHe completed all required court orders. \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana in college. The incidents in 2003 and 2005 are mitigated \nby the passage of time. He also reported that he purchased marijuana one time. However, \nhe had a security clearance when he was arrested for marijuana possession in 2016. He \nclaimed he was holding the marijuana for someone else or did not know the marijuana \nwas in his car or motorcycle.  Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are established.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last incident with possession of marijuana was 2016. After having two \nother incidents with marijuana and an alcohol charge, he did not use good judgment by \nholding marijuana for others.  This is particularly true, as he held a security clearance at \nthat time. The 2016 incident casts doubt on his reliability and good judgment. He may \nhave claimed that he did not know the marijuana was with him, but I do not find that \ncredible. I do not find mitigation under this Guideline. \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has held a security \nclearance since 2009. He has excellent letters of recommendation. He has not had any \ncriminal incidents since 2016.  He successfully completed drug and alcohol programs.   \nHowever, despite the fact that he had past marijuana arrests, he allowed himself to help \na friend and hold marijuana for him. He should have known that this could put him in \njeopardy with his security clearance. At the hearing, he denied what the police report in \n2016 stated, but when he had an opportunity to correct the interrogatories, he made no \nchanges. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s judgment. \n \nApplicant has made great strides, but the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the concerns under Guideline J, but failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation. National security eligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On April 3, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, (Financial Considerations.) The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information; \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines issued by the Director of National \nIntelligence, effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017.1 \n1 GE 1, 3. \n02/01/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 11, 2018.

This debt has not been resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f appears to be a time share account that is more than 120 days past \ndue in the amount of $8,506, with a loan balance of $8,844. In his response to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted this account, but he did not provide any documentation to show that \nthe delinquent account is current, or if he is in the process of paying this debt. This debt \nhas not been resolved.  \n \nIn 2010, a judgment was filed against Applicant, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, in the \namount of $4,050. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted this judgment, but he \ndid not provide any information to indicate that he is either paying, paid, or in the \nprocess of resolving this unsatisfied judgment. This debt has not been resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a clothing account referred for collection in the amount of \n$839. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted this account, but he did not \nprovide any documentation to show that the delinquent account is current, or he is in the \nprocess of resolving this debt. This debt has not been resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a utility account referred for collection in the amount of $106. In \nhis response to the SOR, Applicant denied this account. He failed to provide any \nexplanation or documentation to show that the delinquent account is current, or he is in \nthe process of resolving this debt. This debt has not been resolved. \n \nDepartment Counsel noted in his brief, that: \u201cAbsent documentary evidence \nsubmitted in response to this FORM that Applicant has acted responsibly and in \ngood-faith to satisfy his delinquent debts and established a sustained track \nrecord of financial responsibility, the unmitigated SOR allegations establish a \n\n \n4 \n \n \nbasis for disqualification\u2026.\"5 Despite the clear warning, Applicant did not submit any \nmitigating evidence within the 45-day time period after receipt of the Government \nFORM. He did not provide information concerning a budget or other information related \nto his financial obligations from which to determine his current financial circumstances.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n                                                          \n5 Department Counsel FORM brief page 3. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply. Applicant has approximately $44,000 \nof delinquent debt that is unpaid and unresolved, as shown on his credit reports. In \nISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence to apply any of the mitigating conditions. Applicant \ndenied three of the nine delinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.i. He did \nnot provide any explanation for his denials, and he did not provide any supporting \ndocumentation to show that his disputes, if any, with creditors are legitimate. He did not \nprovide proof of his communication with these creditors, if any, in an effort to resolve the \ndisputed accounts. Applicant admitted responsibility for the other six debts alleged, but \nhe failed to provide any evidence to show that he is paying, resolving, or has paid any of \nthose debts. There is no evidence to show Applicant received financial counseling or \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances in dealing with his creditors.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n7 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a position of trust with the Government. An applicant is \nnot required to be debt-free, but is required to manage his finances to meet his financial \nobligations. \n \n \nApplicant failed to provide supporting documentation to mitigate his delinquent \naccounts and he failed to demonstrate that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances in dealing with his creditors. There is no showing by Applicant of any \neffort to pay, legitimately dispute, or otherwise resolve any of the financial security \nconcerns. Applicant has not provided a financial plan or a detailed budget of his current \nfinancial circumstances. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s good \njudgment, reliability as well as eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Because \nprotection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any \nunresolved doubts must be resolved against the granting of eligibility to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                \n \n            \n \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 30, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended \n(Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 21, 2018. He requested an \nadministrative determination and waived a hearing before an administrative judge. On \nSeptember 11, 2018, Department Counsel requested a hearing and notified Applicant. \n02/13/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nThe case was assigned to me on October 17, 2018. On the same day, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing on \nNovember 13, 2018, via video teleconference. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, which were admitted into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified, but he offered no exhibits at the hearing. I \nkept the record open until December 7, 2018, to give Applicant the opportunity to provide \ndocumentation in support of his case. On December 6, 2018, he emailed to me three \ndocuments. I have marked Applicant\u2019s email and three documents as Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A-D and admitted them into the record, without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing on November 29, 2018 (Tr.). \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and works as a defense contractor. He served in the U.S. \nNavy for 20 years and was honorably discharged in June 2014 at the pay grade of E-6. \nHe worked primarily as a machinist and \u201ccontractor engineer.\u201d He has been married twice, \nonce in 1994 and again in 2017. His first marriage ended in divorce in January 2005. He \nhas three children, two of whom are adults and one is a minor. He pays child support to \nthe mother of the minor child. He also has two stepchildren as a result of his remarriage. \n(Tr. 22, 23, 47.) \n \nApplicant received his high school diploma in 1994 or 1995, and has been taking \ncollege courses to earn an associate\u2019s degree in automotive technology. He also hopes \nto earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in business. (Tr. 7, 21.) \n \n \nFollowing his honorable discharge from the Navy in 2014, Applicant obtained a job \nwith a defense contractor in another state. He is currently employed with a successor \ncompany. At his own expense, he moved to the area where his new employment was \nlocated. The new area has a higher cost of living, which has strained Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation. He is also still recovering from certain expenses associated with his 2005 \ndivorce. (Tr. 24, 25.)  \n \nWhile in the Navy, Applicant held a security clearance. On October 25, 2011, the \nDepartment of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility granted Applicant a secret clearance \nwith a condition that he seek financial counseling for assistance in resolving his delinquent \ndebts. Applicant failed to provide this information in his SCA. A 2011 credit report reflected \nthat Applicant had several delinquent debts and a vehicle repossession and auto loan \ndeficiency at that time. He testified that he was never advised about the conditional nature \nof his clearance, and he did not seek financial counseling at that time. He testified further \nthat his debts in 2011 were the result of his 2005 divorce. (GE 2; GE 4; Tr. 15, 24.) \nOn June 20, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in \nconnection with his new employment with a defense contractor. He disclosed a tax debt \nin his SCA, which he subsequently paid through a garnishment. That debt was not alleged \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application, dated June 20, 2017, \n(GE 1), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nin the SOR. He failed to disclose the debts alleged in the SOR because he claims he was \nunaware of them at the time he prepared his SCA. (GE 2; Tr. 4.) \n \n \nApplicant provided income and expense information to the background \ninvestigator, which showed that he had a $4,000 monthly surplus. At the time of the \nhearing, his monthly financial situation was still stable, though his wife was contributing \nless income from her part-time employment and his monthly rent had increased from \n$1,275 to $2,500 after moving his new family in March 2017. (Tr. 54; GE 3 at 8.) In his \nSOR Answer, Applicant wrote that he was working with a financial counselor to resolve \nhis debts with the debt collectors. He testified that he had received financial counseling \nfrom his tax preparer. He claimed that this person helped him contact one or more of his \ncreditors for the purpose of seeking to resolve his debts and has helped him prepare a \nbudget. Applicant was unable to recall her name at the hearing, and he provided no \nadditional information or documentation after the hearing. (SOR Answer at 1; AE 3 at 8-\n9; Tr. 32-33, 42, 45-46, 53.) \n \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling about $38,000. Applicant\u2019s most \nsignificant debts arose in 2016 and 2017 while he was employed as a contractor and was \nreceiving retirement and disability pay from the Navy. One small credit-card debt arose in \n2011 and two minor debts arose in 2014 and 2015 after he retired from the Navy and \nrelocated for his new employment. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a: rental expense in collection with a balance of $986. In June 2016, \nApplicant was evicted from an apartment he shared with his future second wife and her \nchild after a disruptive incident involving the woman and the child. Applicant was not \npresent at the time of the incident. According to his testimony, Applicant paid the creditor \n$500 towards this debt in October 2018, one month before the hearing. (Tr. 28.) On \nDecember 3, 2018, three weeks after the hearing, he paid the balance due of $780. He \nprovided evidence of the second payment. (AE B.) Applicant has resolved this debt, \nthough he paid it well after his receipt of the SOR. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit card account in collection with a balance of $1,416. \nApplicant took out this credit card while in the Navy. He defaulted on the account in 2017. \n(GE 5 at 3.) He agreed to pay the debt through a voluntary, automatic deduction of $220 \nfrom his Navy retirement account. (GE 3 at 5; Tr. 28-29.) He has paid this debt, and he \nnow has a credit on the account of $342. (AE C.) This debt is resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: vehicle loan charged off for $26,058. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife opened this \naccount in April 2011 in Applicant\u2019s name using a power of attorney that she held. She \ndid this without his knowledge. Shortly thereafter, he found out about her unauthorized \nactions. He did not dispute the $24,000 loan, however, because he was trying to get back \ntogether with her at that time, some six years after they had divorced. At that time he was \npaying his ex-wife $1,200 of monthly child support, and she was using that money to pay \nthe $700 per-month vehicle loan payment. For a reason unknown to Applicant, she \nstopped paying on the loan in 2016, and the bank charged off the loan in December 2016 \nafter repossessing the truck. At the time of the hearing, Applicant had been unable to \n\n \n4 \n \nresolve this debt because the creditor wanted a large, lump-sum payment, which he could \nnot afford. He testified that the creditor did not want to work with him on a payment plan. \nHe last contacted the creditor in September 2018, and he was waiting for the creditor to \nrespond. After the hearing, he advised in an email that he had set up with the creditor an \nautomatic payment of $400 per month out of his retirement pay starting in January 2019. \nNeither Applicant\u2019s offer of a payment plan nor the creditor\u2019s acceptance of the plan has \nbeen documented, and no payments have been made as of the close of the record. (Tr. \n30-33, 50-51, 56; AE A.) The debt is not yet resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: installment loan charged off for $8,595. Applicant borrowed money \nto pay for his relocation in 2014 following his retirement from the Navy. He repaid the loan \nand took out a second loan in April 2016, basically refinancing the initial loan. At that time, \nhe had additional expenses to move some personal property he had left in storage in his \nprior residential area and to pay rent that was past due on his prior residence. He \ndefaulted on this installment loan in 2016, and the lender wrote off the loan balance in \nNovember 2016. In his November 2017 background interview, Applicant said that two \nmonths earlier, he began paying the creditor $175 per month and the current amount of \nthe debt was $7,540. He provided no documentation to support this assertion. After the \nhearing, he sent me an email in which he wrote that he has increased the payments to \n$390 per month from his retirement account, starting in January 2019. (GE 5 at 3; GE 3 \nat 5; Tr. at 33-38, 52; AE A.) It appears that this debt may be in the process of being \nresolved, but Applicant has provided no documentary evidence to support that \nconclusion.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: credit card account charged off for $492. The bank that issued this \ncredit card charged off this account in July 2011. Applicant admitted this debt in his SOR \nresponse, but at the hearing he testified that he had forgotten about the debt. As of the \nhearing, he had not contracted the creditor. He testified that the debt was related to his \n2005 divorce. After the hearing, he paid the debt with another credit card, and he provided \nthe confirmation number because he did not yet have a corroborating receipt from the \ncreditor. (GE 5 at 3; Tr. 38-39; AE A.) It appears that this credit-card debt has been \nresolved with a payment using another credit card. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, and 1.g: delinquent auto insurance and utility bills in collection \nwith a total balance of $169. These accounts have been in collection since 2015 and \n2014, respectively. After the hearing, Applicant provided evidence of his payment of the \ninsurance bill. (AE D.) Applicant provided no information regarding the utility debt in the \namount of $52, though he testified that he would pay it off by the end of November 2018. \n(Tr. 40.) The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is resolved; the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is not. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \n\n \n5 \n \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony and the documentary evidence in the record \nestablish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indication that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Several of Applicant\u2019s debts were ongoing at the \ntime of the hearing. Applicant\u2019s 2011 credit report in the record established that his \nfinancial difficulties began years ago. More recent credit reports in the record show that \nhis problems are continuing. In 2017, he told the background investigator that he had a \nsubstantial excess monthly income each month, yet he failed to take comprehensive \nsteps to address his largest debt or any of the more modest debts. Applicant failed to \nshow that his financial difficulties are unlikely to recur or that his history of financial \nproblems do not cast doubt on his reliability and judgment.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s largest debt, his ex-wife\u2019s loan for a \ntruck, remains. She used Applicant\u2019s power of attorney without his permission to obtain \nthe loan. Applicant did not dispute this debt when he learned about it. He failed to take \naction for personal reasons. Arguably, these were circumstances that arose beyond his \ncontrol since he did not originate this debt. However, his failure to take effective steps to \nbegin to resolve this debt until after the hearing was not responsible under the \ncircumstances. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Applicant offered no documentary evidence that \nhe has received any formal financial counseling, but he did testified that his tax preparer \nhad assisted him on his finances and debts. This informal adviser does not appear to \nqualify as a \u201clegitimate and credible source,\u201d and there is no documentary evidence or \nother substantial evidence clearly indicating that Applicant\u2019s largest debt is being \nresolved. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established. Applicant has made some efforts to pay several \nof the debts alleged in SOR, but with one exception, all of his efforts occurred after his \nreceipt of the SOR. His reluctance to deal with his largest debt until after the hearing \ndemonstrates his general lack of good faith in dealing with his debts in a timely manner. \nDue to this delay, he has not been able to show a track record of consistent payments of \nthis debt. Also, with respect to his payment of the credit-card debt set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.e \nwith another credit card, Applicant has not reduced his overall indebtedness, which \nundercuts the value of his mitigating effort to repay his debts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed above, but other factors warrant additional comment. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s 20 years of service in the Navy and his honorable discharge. I have also \nweighed the fact that his ex-spouse misused Applicant\u2019s power of attorney and the fact \nthat her default on the vehicle loan occurred at a time he was paying her a significant \namount of child support. On the other hand, Applicant accepted this financial obligation \nbefore his ex-wife defaulted on the loan. His failure to make serious efforts to begin to \nresolve this debt until after the hearing does not evidence the requisite responsibility \nrequired for eligibility for a security clearance. Also, Applicant has not established a track \nrecord of financial stability after many years of being unable to pay his debts. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his past actions. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n                                                          \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Nussbaum, Esq.,  \n05/20/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \n \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to deny his \neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Although the criminal \nconduct concerns are mitigated by the passage of time, Applicant failed to mitigate the \nnegative whole-person assessment established by his 2013 and 2015 drug-related \narrests. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 11, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the criminal conduct and personal conduct guidelines.1 DOD \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be submitted to a \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for a \ndetermination whether to grant or deny his security clearance.  \n                                                          \n1 The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended \n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017.   \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. At the hearing, \nconvened on November 29, 2018, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, \nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through H without objection. Applicant testified at the \nhearing, as did two character witnesses. After the hearing, the parties timely submitted \nadditional documentation. Accordingly, GE 4 and AE I, were admitted to the record \nwithout objection from either party. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 7, \n2018.   \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nSOR Amendment \n \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to correct an \nerror in SOR \u00b6 1.b, which indicated Applicant was placed on unsupervised parole after a \nFebruary 2015 drug offense. Without objection from Applicant, the SOR allegation was \namended to reflect that Applicant was sentenced to unsupervised probation after the \nFebruary 2015 offense.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 32, began working for federal contracting companies as an information \ntechnology professional in the healthcare sector in 2013. He has worked for his current \nemployer since January 2016. His job requires him to work with personally identifiable \ninformation (PII) and he holds public trust eligibility. His client considers him a valuable \nasset to the agency he supports, citing his technical abilities and professionalism. He is \nseeking eligibility for access to classified information in an effort to obtain employment \ncloser to his home. He completed a security clearance application in July 2017. In \nresponse to questions about his police record, he disclosed a February 20142 arrest for \npossession of a Schedule III substance. He did not disclose any derogatory information \nin response to questions about his history of illegal drug use or other drug activity. The \nensuing investigation revealed another drug-related arrest in December 2013.3  \n \n \nBetween January and December 2013, Applicant worked for a federal \ncontracting company. Although the nature of the job in unclear from the record, \nApplicant admitted that it required public trust eligibility, which another government \nagency granted in July 2013. In December 2013, Applicant received a phone call from \nhis older brother asking for help changing a tire after a minor car accident. When \nApplicant arrived at his brother\u2019s location, he found his brother\u2019s car unattended while \nthe police arrested his brother further down the block. Applicant approached his \nbrother\u2019s car and began to clear the street of the tools his brother had been using to \nchange the tire. When Applicant returned the tools to the trunk of the car, he discovered \na stash of the marijuana hidden in the trunk. Not wanting his brother to get in any more \ntrouble, Applicant moved the marijuana from his brother\u2019s car into his car. At the time of \nthe incident, Applicant was aware of his employer\u2019s zero-tolerance drug policy. After \n                                                          \n2 The date Applicant reported of the security clearance application was a mistake. \n \n3 Tr. 22-26, 29-30, 33-34; GE 1-2; AE C-D. \n\n \n3 \n \npicking his brother up from the police station, Applicant was stopped by the police who \ndiscovered the marijuana in Applicant\u2019s car. He was arrested and charged with \npossession of marijuana with the intent to distribute. Ultimately, the charge was not \nprosecuted. Applicant claims that he will not act similarly in the future.4 \n \n \nBetween December 2014 and January 2016, Applicant was working for a \ndifferent federal contracting company. At the hearing, he testified that his position \nrequired access to PII and he was required to maintain public trust eligibility. In \nFebruary 2015, Applicant and his friends were traveling to a concert in another state. As \nhe passed through a neighboring state, Applicant was stopped for a moving violation. \nDuring the stop, the police discovered Ketamine, a Schedule III substance, in \nApplicant\u2019s possession. Applicant claims the he did not purchase the drug, but that it \nwas given to him by \u201ca friend of a friend.\u201d When questioned about the substance, \nApplicant lied and told the officer it was cocaine. At hearing, Applicant explained that he \nthought having cocaine would be considered a lesser offense. He also admitted that, \nbut for his arrest, he intended to use the ketamine at the concert in knowing violation of \nhis employer\u2019s drug policy. The court sentenced Applicant to a deferred-adjudication \nprogram and required him to serve 100 hours of community service, attend substance-\nabuse classes, and pay the fees assessed by the court. He completed terms of his \nsentence and was released from unsupervised probation in July 2016.5  \n \n \nApplicant did not report either of his arrests to his respective employers. He \nclaims that he did not believe that he had an obligation to do so. In particular, Applicant \ndid not believe that he was required to report his 2015 unsupervised probation to his \nemployer because it did not affect the quality of his work. Applicant did not list the 2013 \narrest on his security clearance application because he believed the arrest was \nexpunged and his criminal defense lawyer advised him that he did not need to disclose \nthe arrest in the future. Despite his two drug-related arrests, Applicant claims that his \nhistory of illegal drug use is limited to experimenting with marijuana two or three times in \nhigh school. He claims that he has no intent to use or possess illegal drugs in the future. \nIn anticipation of the hearing, Applicant completed a second substance-abuse course. \nApplicant believes that he has matured since his last arrest five years ago. He moved \naway from what he described as an unhealthy environment and is now living in his \nchildhood home with his wife. He spends his free time with his wife or on home \nprojects.6  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 34-39, 44-45, 50, 58-60; GE 4; AE A.  \n \n5 Tr.  34-39, 44-45, 51-53, 57-60; GE 3; AE I. \n \n6 Tr. 30-31, 42-43, 53-55, 61-62; AE B, H. \n\n \n4 \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness... and calls into question a personal ability or willingness to comply with \nlaw, rules and regulations.7 Applicant\u2019s drug-related arrests in 2013 and 2015 are \n                                                          \n7 AG \u00b6 30. \n \n\n \n5 \n \ndisqualifying under the criminal conduct guideline as evidence of criminal conduct,8 as \nwell as a pattern of minor offenses that when considered together cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.9 Although the conduct is not enough \non its own for disqualification under the drug involvement guideline, it is disqualifying \nconduct under the personal conduct guideline. Applicant\u2019s multiple instances of drug-\nrelated misconduct support a negative whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not properly \nsafeguard against classified or sensitive information.10  \n \nWhile the criminal conduct concerns may be mitigated by the passage of time,11 \nthe \npersonal conduct \nconcerns about \nApplicant\u2019s \ncredibility, \njudgment \nand \ntrustworthiness remain. On at least two occasions, Applicant willingly and knowingly \nengaged in drug-related criminal conduct while working in positions that required public \ntrust eligibility and in violation of his employers\u2019 drug policies, showing a pattern of poor \njudgment. His behavior at the time of the arrests and his handling of each incident \nreveals an ongoing credibility issue. During the 2015 arrest, he lied to a police officer, \nintentionally reporting false information in hopes of minimizing the potential \nconsequences of his actions. In his current attempt to obtain a security clearance, he \ndid not properly disclose his arrest history or drug involvement on his security clearance \napplication despite the plain language of the relevant questions.12 In addition, \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about his history of illegal drug use was not credible. It is unlikely \nthat an individual would give an illegal substance to an acquaintance who was not a \nknown drug user. Likewise, it is not credible that Applicant, who claims to have no \nhistory of illegal drug use since high school, would accept any illegal drugs from an \nacquaintance, let alone plan to use it. The favorable evidence in the record about \nApplicant\u2019s technical abilities or his value to his government client do not overcome the \nnegative whole-person assessment raised by his misconduct and lack of credibility.  \n \nBased on the record, I have significant reservations about Applicant\u2019s current \nsecurity worthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d) in addition to the mitigating conditions available under the \npersonal conduct guideline. The present adjudication highlights ongoing concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness. When confronted with a conflict of \ninterest between his fiduciary duty as a public trust holder and those of his personal \n                                                          \n8 AG \u00b6 31(b). \n \n9 AG \u00b631(a).  \n \n10 AG \u00b6 16(c). \n \n11 AG \u00b6 32(a).  \n \n12 Although the SOR does not allege that that Applicant engaged in drug-related criminal conduct while \nholding public trust eligibility or that he falsified the police record or drug history questions on his security \nclearance application, both can be considered in the analysis of the applicability of the relevant mitigating \nconditions.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \ncircumstances, he resolved the conflicts in his self-interest. Of particular concern is \nApplicant\u2019s failure to report his criminal conduct to his respective employers at the time \nthe incidents occurred. His claim that he unaware of his duty to report such adverse \ninformation is disingenuous. It is more likely that Applicant was trying to avoid the \nprofessional consequences of his off-duty misconduct. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s failure \nto report prevented his employers and the government from assessing his continued \npublic trust eligibility at the time the misconduct occurred. In deciding that his off-duty \nmisconduct did not affect his work, Applicant made himself, not the government, \nadjudicator of any potential security risks associated with his misconduct.  \n \nThe purpose of the security clearance adjudication is to make \u201can examination of \na sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person \nis an acceptable security risk.\u201d13 Given Applicant\u2019s past conduct, he has not \ndemonstrated that he is a suitable candidate for access to classified information at this \ntime.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Criminal Conduct \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nAGAINST APPPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

In \ntheir ensuing divorce, Applicant was assigned most of their marital debt. Applicant has \nrepaid all but one of the debts at issue here, and his financial and personal circumstances \nare much improved. He is unlikely to incur such financial problems again, and the security \nconcerns about his finances are mitigated. His request for security clearance eligibility is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 19, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nhis employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing background \n03/14/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense (DOD) could not determine that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security \nclearance.1 \n \n \nOn May 4, 2018, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that \nraise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial considerations \n(Guideline F). Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing.  \n \n \nI received the case on September 19, 2018, and convened the requested hearing \non, December 11, 2018. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel \nproffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 4. Applicant testified and proffered Applicant \nExhibits (AX) A \u2013 E. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I received a transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on January 7, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant owed $21,901 for 16 \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.p). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nonly SOR 1.d, and he denied the rest. In his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed the debts alleged \nat SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c, 1.g, and 1.i. The remaining debts are documented in three credit reports \nobtained during Applicant\u2019s background investigation and the adjudication of this case. \n(Answer; GX 1 \u2013 4) In addition to the facts thus established, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old. After working in various jobs after high school, he joined \nthe Army in April 2010. Applicant served on active duty, which included a one-year \ndeployment to Afghanistan in 2011 and 2012, until receiving an honorable discharge in \nOctober 2013. Thereafter, he served in the Army Reserve until he was medically \ndischarged in February 2014. Except for four months in 2014, Applicant was unemployed \nafter leaving the Army until he was hired by a defense contractor in July 2015. Applicant \nwas hired by his current employer in January 2016. Applicant previously held a security \nclearance as part of his military duties in the Army Signal Corps. (GX 1; Tr. 6 \u2013 7, 27, 29) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife have been married since December 2016. They have two \nchildren under two years of age, for whom his wife cares as a stay-at-home mom. \nApplicant was previously married from June 2010 until a divorce decree was finalized in \nAugust 2014. The couple separated in 2012, one month after Applicant returned from \nAfghanistan. All but two2 of the debts at issue in this case were opened in Applicant\u2019s \nname by his ex-wife either while he was overseas or shortly after he returned. She did so \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n \n2 The debt at SOR 1.h was owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for overpayment of benefits. \nThat debt was resolved in February 2018. The debt at SOR 1.m was owed to the Defense Finance and \nAccounting Service (DFAS) for military equipment Applicant had not turned in when he returned from \ndeployment. That debt was resolved in June 2016. (AX E; Tr. 38 \u2013 40) \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nusing a general power of attorney he gave her so she could manage their affairs in his \nabsence. His ex-wife opened several accounts to buy things they could not afford, \nincluding a houseful of furniture, two cars, and even orthodontic braces. None of the \naccounts was paid as required during his absence. Applicant had no knowledge of her \nmalfeasance until he returned. Even after they separated, she was able to abuse their \nfinances by writing checks from their bank account and purchasing a second car. His ex-\nwife\u2019s conduct ended when Applicant closed their joint bank account. (GX 1 \u2013 4; Tr. 26 \u2013 \n27, 41) \n \n \nDespite his ex-wife\u2019s misconduct, Applicant has accepted responsibility for the \ndebts because it was he who gave her power of attorney in the first place. In May 2016, \nafter nearly a year of steady employment with a defense contractor, Applicant obtained \nthe services of a debt management firm (DMF) to negotiate with his creditors and \nestablish a monthly repayment plan that would resolve most or all of his outstanding \ndebts. Initially, debt payments were delayed by about seven months because DMF was \nunable to implement automatic withdrawals from either of Applicant\u2019s two bank accounts. \nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP, he was paying $700 each month to pay the debts \nat SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f. To date, only SOR 1.a remains unresolved, but his \ncurrent monthly payment of $483 is now being directed to pay that debt. (GX 1; AX B; AX \nE; Tr. 44 \u2013 45) \n \n \nApplicant successfully resolved the debts at SOR 1.g and 1.j after proving to those \ncreditors that his ex-wife had misused his identity. In those instances, she had used his \nsocial security number but with her name on the accounts. Applicant resolved the \nremaining debts listed in the SOR by paying those creditors directly. (AX C \u2013 E; Tr. 31 \u2013 \n41) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are sound. He has only two credit cards, which as of \nthe hearing, had a combined balance due under $700. He currently earns $81,000 \nannually and has no other outstanding debts. Applicant files and pays his taxes as \nrequired, has a good command of his personal finances, and appears to be living \nmodestly and within his means. (AX A; Tr. 28 \u2013 30, 41, 46) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,3 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) \nof the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:  \n                                                 \n3 See Directive. 6.3. \n \n4 The current adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, \n2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.6 A person who has access \nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based \non trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access in favor of the Government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established that the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR were \nattributable to Applicant. When the SOR was issued, many of those debts had not yet \nbeen resolved. That information reasonably raised a security concern about Applicant\u2019s \nfinances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \n                                                 \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n7 See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nMore specifically, available information supported application of the disqualifying \nconditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts). By contrast, Applicant established \nthat his debts arose entirely from events and circumstances beyond his control. It is \nunreasonable to conclude he knew or could have known it was likely that his ex-wife \nwould abuse a power of attorney on which most deploying service members rely to ensure \ntheir obligations are timely met during a prolonged absence from home. \n \nIn response to his ex-wife\u2019s actions, Applicant acted responsibly and promptly to \nchange his financial circumstances. The couple separated and Applicant closed their \naccounts. Applicant was assigned most of the marital debt in a 2014 divorce. After gaining \nsteady employment in the defense industry, Applicant has spent most of the past three \nyears resolving all of the debts in which he had no part in generating. Applicant\u2019s finances \nare currently sound and it appears unlikely such financial problems will recur. All of the \nforegoing supports application of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nOn balance, I conclude the record as a whole is sufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by the Government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s finances. I also have \nevaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). \nParticularly noteworthy is the information regarding Applicant\u2019s response to his adverse \nfinancial circumstances. It reflects well on Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. A fair and \ncommonsense assessment of the record evidence as a whole shows the security \nconcerns about his finances are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.p:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGOLDSTEIN, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: \nThis case alleges security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 19, 2016. \n(Item 4.) On March 28, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guidelines F and E. (Item 1.) The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016), implemented June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 25, 2018 (Item 3), and requested a decision \non the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on October 17, 2018. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was \nsent to Applicant, including documents identified as Items 1 through 8. He was given an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \n02/25/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on October 24, 2018, and did not \nrespond. Items 1 through 8 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 11, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 41, is divorced and has three children. He has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since 2007. (Item 4.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant is delinquent on eight accounts in the approximate \namount of $33,868. These debts were identified on credit reports dated May 2017, \nFebruary 2018, and October 2018. (Items 6 through 8.) They include a state tax lien; \nmultiple charged-off consumer accounts; two delinquent energy bills; a medical debt; and \na collection account. Applicant admitted each of the alleged delinquencies in his Answer. \n(Item 3.) He provided no documentation of any actions taken to resolve these debts. His \nonly comment about their status was that some of them were attributable to his divorce. \n(Answer.) They are unresolved.  \n \nAdditionally, Applicant lost a home to a foreclosure in 2016. His current financial \nproblems were preceded by a November 2004 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, which was \ndischarged in February 2005. (Answer; Item 6.) \n \nOn December 19, 2016, Applicant submitted a SCA and certified that the \nstatements he made therein were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct to the best of [his] \nknowledge and belief and [were] made in good faith.\u201d (Item 5.) However, Applicant \nanswered, \u201cNo\u201d to the question about liens filed against him in section 26 of his SCA. He \nadmitted he deliberately failed to list the state tax lien filed against him in 2016. (Item 3; \nAnswer.)  \n \nApplicant also failed to disclose his foreclosure, collection account, and charged-\noff accounts on his SCA. Question 26 asked Applicant to report if in the past seven years \nhe: had any possessions or property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed or \nforeclosed; had any bills turned over to a collection agency; or had any account or credit \ncard suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed. Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to these questions and deliberately failed to disclose the debts identified \non the SOR in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 1.f through 1.i. Applicant admitted he falsified this \nanswer. (Item 3; Answer.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n\n \n4 \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \n \nThe financial security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the \nfollowing potentially applicable factors set out in AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved. \nFurther, he has a long history of indebtedness, including a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2004. \nFinancial problems in the future are likely. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. While Applicant\u2019s divorce was a condition beyond \nhis control, he has not acted responsibly to address the resulting debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not respond to the FORM \nand the record does not otherwise demonstrate his efforts, if any, to resolve his financial \n\n \n5 \n \ndelinquencies. The record is silent as to his current ability to repay his delinquent debts, \nthe reasons that they have persisted, or his plan to resolve them. His financial problems \nare not under control.  \n \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j. against Applicant. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his SCAs, the following disqualifying \ncondition applies: \n \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant admitted intentionally falsifying his SCAs. In this instance, it is apparent \nfrom Applicant\u2019s comments that he was aware of his state tax lien, foreclosure, collection \naccount, and charged-off accounts. He should have disclosed these facts to the \nGovernment. I find substantial evidence of an intent by Applicant to omit, conceal, or \nfalsify facts from and on his SCAs. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nany of the following potentially applicable factors in AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined above, none of them apply. \nApplicant did not make prompt or good-faith efforts to correct his falsifications or \nconcealments. He failed to establish any prompt or good-faith disclosure before being \nconfronted with his unlisted debts. He provided no information that indicates he was ill-\nadvised in completing his SCAs. Falsifying information is a serious offense, and Applicant \nhas shown that similar lapses in judgment are likely to occur. He has not provided \nsufficient information in this record to demonstrate that he has met his burden of proof for \nhis personal conduct. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \n\n \n7 \n \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by the falsification of his SCAs and his financial indebtedness. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nJennifer I. Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline B based upon \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to the Republic of China (Taiwan). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nHistory of the Case \nOn May 7, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline B. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended (Exec. Or.); Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all \nadjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 18, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge of the Defense Office at the Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on October 4, 2018. On October 17, 2018, DOHA issued a \n02/19/2019\n\n \n \n2\nNotice of Hearing scheduling the hearing on November 13, 2018. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled. \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered two exhibits into evidence, which I \nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. He also offered two requests for \nAdministrative Notice, one regarding Taiwan and the other regarding the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (China). I marked these as GE 3 and 4. Applicant testified and offered \none exhibit. I marked his exhibit as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A. Government Exhibits 1 \nand 2 and AE A were admitted into the record without objection, although Applicant \nprovided some corrections to GE 2.  \n \nI kept the record open until December 14, 2018, to give Applicant the opportunity \nto provide additional documentation in support of his case. On December 13, 2018, he \nemailed me a document. I have marked Applicant\u2019s email and document as AE B and \nadmitted the exhibit into the record without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on November 29, 2018. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Taiwan and China. His written requests (GE 3 and 4) and supporting documents \nwere not admitted into the record as evidence, but are attached to the record solely for \nadministrative notice purposes. The facts administratively noticed are set forth below in \nmy findings of fact.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the three SOR allegations. His \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1973 and is 45 years old. He was raised \nin Taiwan and graduated from high school in 1991 and college in 1995. He received his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in aeronautical engineering. After graduating, he relocated to the \nUnited States to pursue his post-graduate education in engineering. He received two \nmaster\u2019s degrees, one in 1997 and the second in 1999. In 2002, he began a doctorate \nprogram in the United States. He completed his Ph. D. in 2006. All of his U.S. degrees \nwere awarded by prestigious U.S. universities.  \n \nAfter receiving his second master\u2019s degree in 1999, Applicant moved back to \nTaiwan and worked there for about three years. He returned to the United States to enter \na doctorate program. After receiving his Ph. D., he remained in the United States and has \nworked at five U.S. companies. His two most recent positions have been with major U.S. \ndefense contractors. In December 2016, he was sponsored for a security clearance by \n                                                          \n \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GE 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n \n3\nthe first defense contractor. Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA) was \nsubmitted shortly after he began working for this employer. He changed companies three \nmonths later, and his new employer is continuing to sponsor him for a clearance. (GE 2 \nat 2; Tr. 14-15.) \n \n \nWhile living in Taiwan in 2002, Applicant married a Taiwanese woman. They \nmoved to the United States later that year when Applicant began his doctoral studies. \nThey have since had three children, ages, 15, 13, and 9. They were all born in the United \nStates and are U.S. citizens. At one point, they possessed Taiwanese passports. \nApplicant is unsure whether they are presently dual citizens of the United States and \nTaiwan. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. at 40-41.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s first U.S. employer applied for Applicant to become a permanent \nresident in the United States. In 2011, the government granted him and his wife alien \nregistration status. They became naturalized U.S. citizens in July 2016, a few months \nbefore Applicant submitted his SCA. On October 26, 2018, shortly before the hearing in \nthis case, Applicant submitted a request to the Taiwanese government to renounce his \nTaiwanese citizenship. His request was granted on November 27, 2018, after the DOHA \nhearing. His wife retains her dual citizenship with Taiwan. Applicant renounced his \nTaiwanese citizenship based upon the advice of his employers, which have sponsored \nhim for a security clearance. (AE A and B; Tr. 14, 32.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, and sister are citizens and residents of Taiwan. His \nmother is a homemaker. When Applicant was young, she was a full-time, and later a part-\ntime, high school teacher. She ceased working as a teacher when Applicant was in \nschool. His father is retired. He worked as a teacher at a vocational school. In his SCA, \nApplicant wrote that neither of his parents had or presently has any affiliation with the \nTaiwanese government or its affiliated industries. In his SCA, he reported that he speaks \nwith his parents weekly. He testified that more recently, he speaks with them \u201cconstantly,\u201d \nwhich he then explained is every other week. (Tr. 25, 44.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his father paid for his two U.S. master\u2019s degrees. His father \nwas born in 1941 and was 56 years old when Applicant earned his first master\u2019s degree \nin 1997 and was 58 when he earned his second master\u2019s. Applicant\u2019s father retired in \n1996 at the age of 55. (Tr. 54.) \n \nWhen asked if either the Taiwanese government or the Chinese government paid \nfor any of his education, Applicant equivocally responded \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d When the \nquestion was repeated, he answered \u201cNo\u201d and then changed the subject to the low cost \nof education in Taiwan and other matters. Applicant\u2019s responses and his demeanor at \nthat point in the hearing suggested that he may not have been completely candid in \nanswering questions about who paid his tuition and living expenses for four years of \ngraduate education while he was studying for his two master\u2019s degrees in the United \nStates. Applicant also testified that he paid the expenses for his doctorate studies with \nhis own savings from when he worked in Taiwan for three years (1999-2002) and by \nworking as a research assistant at his U.S. university. (Tr. 41, 54, 55.) \n\n \n \n4\n \nApplicant\u2019s sister is a professor at a public university in Taiwan. She also received \na Ph. D. from a U.S. university. In his SCA, he wrote that he communicates with his sister \nmonthly. He testified, however, that he actually has much less communication with her \nand has not spoken with her since his most recent trip to Taiwan in July 2018, about four \nmonths earlier. He said he only communicates with her when he visits Taiwan. He \nprovided no explanation for the discrepancy between his 2016 SCA disclosure and his \ntestimony on this point. (Tr. 25-26, 44.) \n \n \nThe parents and the siblings of Applicant\u2019s wife are also citizens and residents of \nTaiwan. His wife has a close and continuing relationship with her Taiwanese family. Her \nmother worked as a sales person for a clothing company, and her father worked as a \nsecurity guard at an apartment building. Both are now retired. Her sister is employed in \nthe financial industry in Taiwan. Her brother is a salesman, who sells anti-theft, car-\nlocking devices.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has regular contact with her family in Taiwan. In his SCA, Applicant \nwrote that he speaks with his mother and father-in-law monthly by phone. At the hearing, \nhe testified that he merely says hello to his wife\u2019s parents once a month when he happens \nto be in the same room as his wife when she is talking on the phone with her parents. In \nhis background interview, he said that he has monthly telephone contact with his sister-\nin-law and brother-in-law when he is with his wife and she is talking with them on the \nphone. At the hearing, he described his contacts with his sister-in-law and brother-in-law \nin the same manner. (GE 1 at 30-32; GE 2 at 4; Tr. at 26, 44, and 51-53.) \n \n \nIn response to Section 19 (\u201cForeign Contacts\u201d) of the SCA, Applicant disclosed \nthat he has three friends from his undergraduate days with whom he has \u201cclose and/or \ncontinuing contact.\u201d He noted that he maintains annual contact with each of them. He \ntestified that in addition to their contacts as undergraduates in Taiwan, he also lived with \nthem in Taiwan for about six months in 2002 before he moved to the United States for his \ndoctorate program. He testified without any explanation that he \u201cwas required to provide \nthree names in Taiwan\u201d and that it \u201cwas hard for me to generate those three names.\u201d The \nthree \u201cforeign contacts\u201d he identified are not the three persons he was asked to identify \nin response to Section 16 (\u201cPeople Who Know You Well\u201d) of his SCA. He provided \ninformation for four persons with U.S. addresses in response to that question. (Tr. at 15, \n26, 27, and 44-45.) \n \n \nThe three foreign contacts Applicant identified work for an aircraft engine \nmaintenance company, an electronic equipment inspection company, and a company that \nmanufactures power supply lines for computers. Applicant had to contact them to obtain \ntheir employment information in his SCA because he did not know what they did or the \nnames of their employers. Furthermore, he testified that he does not \u201cvisit my friend[s] \nthat much\u201d and \u201cbasically I don\u2019t have a friend in Taiwan.\u201d He did admit though that he \nand his wife saw one of his listed foreign contacts in the hospital during his most recent \ntrip to Taiwan in the summer of 2018, but claimed that this person \u201cforced me to meet \nwith him.\u201d (Tr. 15-16, 26, and 45-49.) \n\n \n \n5\nThroughout his testimony discussing his three foreign relationships, Applicant \nattempted to minimize the extent of his contacts with them, making the point that he did \nnot have their phone numbers and only communicated with them through social media. \nHe testified that his contacts with them were \u201cactually\u201d limited to the 1997 or 1998 time \nperiod, when he and one friend communicated about their courses in mathematics. He \nfailed to reconcile this statement with his testimony that he actually lived with these three \npersons in 2002. He also testified that \u201ceven though I know they work in the technology \nindustry but I don\u2019t exactly know what they do in Taiwan, their job descriptions in detail \nbecause basically we don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d In his background interview, however, he told \nthe interviewer that with respect to one of the friends, they work in the same industry and \nfrequently discuss industry topics when they have contact. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent \nstatements, demeanor, and the credibility of his testimony about his relationships with his \nfriends suggested that he was attempting to portray falsely his relationships with one or \nmore of his reported foreign contacts. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. at 26, 27, and 44-45.) \n \n \nPrior to obtaining his U.S. citizenship in July 2016 and receiving his U.S. passport \na month later, Applicant travelled on his Taiwanese passport. After he was awarded his \nPh. D. in 2006, Applicant has returned to Taiwan six times. Applicant visited Taiwan each \nsummer in 2016, 2017, and 2018. (GE 2 at 2; Tr. at 65.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife have lived in a home they own since 2010, for two years in \none state and then six years in another. Applicant provided no documentary evidence or \ntestimony of his other financial ties to the United States. He has renounced his Taiwanese \ncitizenship and considers himself to be an American. He believes he has lived in the \nUnited States for a long time, and he followed all of the proper procedures to obtain his \nU.S. citizenship. He testified that he has no contact with anyone in Taiwan who works in \nhis industry. (Tr. 29, 57-58, and 67.) \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts regarding Taiwan and \nChina. Taiwan is a multi-party democracy, established as a separate, independent \ngovernment by refugees from mainland China in 1949. The United States recognized \nTaiwan as an independent government until January 1979, when it formally recognized \nthe Chinese government as the sole legal government of all of China, including Taiwan. \nThis has been referred to as the U.S. \u201cOne-China\u201d policy. Nevertheless, the United States \nand Taiwan enjoy a positive, unofficial relationship.  \n \nChinese actors are the world\u2019s most active perpetrators of economic espionage. \nChina aggressively targets sensitive and protected U.S. technologies and military \ninformation, using worldwide intelligence operations, including Chinese intelligence \noperatives based in Taiwan. The United States faces a serious threat to its national \nsecurity from Chinese intelligence collection operations. China uses it intelligence \nservices and employs other illicit approaches that violate U.S. laws and export controls to \nobtain important export-restricted technologies and equipment. China\u2019s collection \nactivities include the use of Chinese nationals, such as students and researchers to act \nas procurement agents or intermediaries. \n \n\n \n \n6\nTaiwan has a strong economy and maintains significant economic contacts with \nChina. For many years, Taiwan has also been an active collector of U.S. economic \nintelligence and technology, including dual-use technologies that have sensitive military \napplications. There have been numerous cases involving illegal export or attempted \nexport of sensitive, dual-use technology to Taiwan. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n\n \n \n7\nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR sets forth three allegations under Guideline B. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father and sister are citizens and residents of Taiwan. SOR \u00b6 1.b \nalleges that Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law and brother-in-law are \nalso citizens and residents of Taiwan. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant has three friends \nfrom his undergraduate years, who are citizens and residents of Taiwan and work in the \ntechnology industry. \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6, as follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n\n \n \n8\nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n \nAG \u00b67(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence has established that Applicant\u2019s foreign \ncontacts, as well as his wife\u2019s, create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. These relationships also \nconstitute connections to foreign persons that creates a potential conflict of interest \nbetween Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or \ntechnology and Applicant\u2019s desire to help family members, in-laws, or friends by \nproviding that information or technology. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply to \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with the foreign contacts and connections alleged in the \nSOR. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) has not been established. With respect to Applicant\u2019s immediate foreign \nfamily members and in-laws, he has not presented sufficient evidence to meet his burden \nof persuasion to mitigate the security concerns under this mitigating condition. His \nrelationships with these foreign persons is sufficiently close and continuing and the \ncountry in which they are located raises serious security concerns so as to preclude a \nconclusion that it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \n\n \n \n9\nbetween the interests of these foreign family members and the interests of the United \nStates.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) has not been established. Applicant presented limited evidence of his \nties to the United States. His evidence consists mainly of his post-graduate education in \nthe United States, his 12 years of living in this country since the completion of his graduate \nstudies, his five jobs during that period, and the births of his children in the United States. \nAlthough he and his wife have owned their home in the United States for the past eight \nyears, Applicant provided no significant, additional information of a financial nature, or \notherwise evidencing that he has deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in \nthe United States. Applicant was a U.S. citizen for only five months before he applied for \na security clearance. Furthermore, his sense of loyalty and obligation to his Taiwanese \nfamily members and in-laws is hardly minimal. Based upon Applicant\u2019s limited evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns raised by his foreign connections, I cannot conclude that \nhe has satisfied his burden of persuasion under this mitigating condition to establish that \nthere is no conflict of interest and that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) has not been established with respect to his Taiwanese family members \nand his wife\u2019s. Applicant has a close relationship with his immediate family members in \nTaiwan. Moreover, there is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant\u2019s contacts with \nimmediate family members are not casual. ADP Case No. 12-03783 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. \n12, 2013); ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). Applicant has not \nrebutted this presumption. The same is true with respect to Applicant\u2019s in-laws. \u201c\u2018[T]here \nis a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligations to, the \nimmediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-00084 at 3 (App. \nBd. May 22, 2014), quoting ISCR Case No. 12-07647 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2013). See \nalso ISCR Case No. 14-05986 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2016) (the above-quoted rebuttable \npresumption is \u201cwell settled\u201d). Applicant\u2019s regular trips to Taiwan to visit family members \nfurther supports this conclusion. \n \nWith respect to his three Taiwanese friends identified in his SCA and referred to in \nthe SOR, the fact that Applicant and his friends work in the technology industry in Taiwan \nrenders his contacts with his friends meaningful from a security standpoint. While I found \nsome of Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding his minimal contacts with his friends to be \nunpersuasive, I conclude that his contacts and communications with these friends are \ncasual and infrequent. The mitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 8(c) has been established \nwith respect to the three friends, who are the subject of SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \n\n \n \n10 \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some factors and evidence deserve \nfurther consideration. I have weighed Applicant\u2019s renunciation of his Taiwanese \ncitizenship. While this certainly evidences Applicant\u2019s preference for the United States, it \ndoes not address the security concerns raised in this case under Guideline B, which are \nfocused on the heightened risk of foreign exploitation of Applicant due to his close foreign \ncontacts and those of his wife and the risk of a conflict of interest between the interests \nof his foreign relatives and the interests of the United States. As noted above, the record \nin this case establishes significant security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e). I \nhave also weighed the limited mitigating evidence provided by Applicant. As a new U.S. \ncitizen as of the date of his SCA, he failed to provide significant evidence showing that he \nenjoys deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. I have also \nconsidered the testimony of Applicant that I have noted above to be less than fully candid. \nA lack of complete candidness and trustworthiness in an applicant\u2019s hearing testimony \nweighs against one\u2019s eligibility. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the circumstances of his foreign family \nmembers and his wife\u2019s. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n \n11 \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Allison R. Weber, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the  security concerns under Guideline J, criminal \nconduct, Guideline G, alcohol consumption and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 6, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline J. The DOD \nacted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant answered (A1) the SOR on May 23, 2018, and requested a hearing. \nOn August 20, 2018, an amended SOR was sent to Applicant adding allegations under \n02/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGuidelines G and E. Applicant answered the amended SOR on September 13, 2018 \n(A2). The case was assigned to me on September 18, 2018. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 18, 2018, and the \nhearing was held as scheduled on November 28, 2018. The Government offered \nexhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence without objection, except \nfor GE 3, which objection was overruled. The Government\u2019s Exhibit list was marked as \nhearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and presented the testimony of four witnesses. \nHe provided five character letters, which were attached to his original answer (A1\u2014\nattachments). DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 7, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn A1, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.b, with explanations, and denied SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nIn A2, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 2.a, with explanations, and denied SOR \u00b6 3.a. The \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 30 years old. He has never married and has no children. He has \nworked for a defense contractor since January 2016. Before his current position he was \nincarcerated in a state penitentiary for 28 months for felony aggravated assault. Upon \nhis release from prison, he was placed on probation, which he successfully completed \nin February 2016. He has a high school diploma.1   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant discharged a firearm into an unoccupied vehicle in \nMay 2012, which resulted in a citation for criminal damage (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleged \nthat in August 2012, Applicant shot an associate in the face, pushed his body out of his \ntruck, and fled the scene. He was charged with attempted first degree murder and \naggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced to \nthree and one-half years imprisonment (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The amended SOR alleged that \nApplicant was under the influence of alcohol when he committed the acts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Also in the amended SOR, all the above acts were \ncross-alleged as personal conduct under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 3.a).  \n \n \n \nOn approximately May 10 and into May 11, 2012, Applicant and a friend (F) (who \nhe described as his best friend at that time) were drinking alcohol at a friend\u2019s house. \nUpon leaving the residence, rather than driving home, Applicant chose to sleep in his \ntruck parked outside. The police were called when a neighbor\u2019s car alarm went off. The \npolice investigated noting that a car window was broken close to where Applicant\u2019s truck \nwas parked. Applicant was sleeping in his vehicle when the police approached him. He \nwas questioned about whether he damaged the car window. Applicant appeared \nintoxicated to the officer. Applicant said he did not know if he broke the window, but that \nit was possible that he broke it. Applicant had a loaded pistol in his truck at the time of \nthe incident. Evidence discovered at the scene included a shell casing next to the \ndamaged car. Applicant was issued a citation for criminal damage to property. The case \n                                                          \n1 Tr. 85, 95, 98; GE 1. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwas disposed of through a civil compromise where Applicant paid the victims of his \ncriminal damage and his criminal case was dismissed. His father paid the civil \ncompromise fee on behalf of Applicant. Applicant admitted that alcohol played a part in \nthis incident.2 \n \n \n \nIn August 2012, Applicant and F engaged in an evening of drinking at various \nlocations. Applicant claims F also used Xanax as well. Applicant claimed he drank at \nleast seven alcoholic beverages and F drank more than that. After leaving a restaurant, \nApplicant and F drove away in Applicant\u2019s truck. Applicant had two handguns in his \ntruck, one in the center compartment, and one in the driver\u2019s side compartment. \nSometime late in the evening, Applicant and F began arguing. It reached the point that \nApplicant claimed that F reached into the center compartment and grabbed the gun. \nApplicant reacted by pulling the gun on the driver\u2019s side and shooting F in the face, \nopening the passenger door, pushing F out, and driving away. He admitted using \nalcohol that night, but testified that he was in control of his senses when he shot F. \nLater, he was arrested by the police and charged with attempted first degree murder \nand two counts of aggravated assault. After consulting with his attorney, he decided to \nforego pursuing self-defense with a not guilty plea at trial. Instead, Applicant pleaded \nguilty to aggravated assault in May 2013, and was sentenced to three and one-half \nyears in the state penitentiary. Upon completion of his sentence, he was placed on \nprobation, which he successfully completed in February 2016. F survived the shooting, \nbut has had multiple surgeries since the shooting. Applicant does not recall apologizing \nto F or his family at his sentencing hearing. He has not spoken to F since the incident. \nApplicant had no misconduct incidents while incarcerated and has had no law \nenforcement involvement since his release.3 \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he used alcohol before both the May and August 2012 \nincidents. He did not receive any alcohol treatment or counseling while incarcerated. He \ncontinues to drink alcohol. The last time he was intoxicated was at a friend\u2019s wedding \nabout a year ago. He consumed about five drinks in five hours. He has not sought \nalcohol treatment or counseling since leaving prison.4  \n \n \nApplicant presented the testimony of three officers from his company (the vice \npresident of finance, the chief operating officer, and the chief executive officer) at \nhearing. They also provided statements. All described the process of hiring Applicant for \ntheir IT position. They were aware of his legal issues when they hired him. Applicant\u2019s \nfather formerly worked for the same company and suggested him for the position. The \nofficers knew there was risk involved should they hire Applicant. They decided to do so \nanyway. They universally believe the company has been rewarded many times over by \nhiring Applicant. He has earned more and more responsibility by performing in an \n                                                          \n2 Tr. 58-59; GE 3, 5. \n \n3 Tr. 62, 65-66, 70, 82-85, 89-90, 95, 98-99; GE 2, 4-5. \n \n4 Tr. 74, 98-99. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \noutstanding manner. All the officers trust Applicant implicitly and all recommend the \ngranting of his clearance.5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n                                                          \n5 Tr. 20-23, 25, 34-37, 39-40, 44-52; A1--attachments. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.  \n \nApplicant was convicted of aggravated assault by shooting his friend in the face. \nHe also was involved in criminal damage to private property, which was resolved \nthrough a civil payment to the victim. I find that the stated disqualifying condition \napplies.  \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nBoth of the criminal acts committed by Applicant involved his use and abuse of \nalcohol. Despite what has happened in the past, he continues to use alcohol. Although \nseveral years have passed since his criminal action, it cannot reasonably be determined \nthat such behavior might not happen in the future since he still consumes alcohol, which \nobviously impaired his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment in the past. While \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant is credited with some mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a), it is insufficient to \novercome the disqualifying condition. Applicant should be commended for the strides he \nhas made toward rehabilitation. However, his callousness in shooting his friend, pushing \nhim out of his truck, and leaving him for dead is not overcome by his successful IT \ncareer since leaving prison. AG \u00b6 32(d) does not fully apply.   \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder.  \n \n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s criminal acts involved his abuse of alcohol and support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions.  \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23 and found the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations; and  \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant was sent to prison for over three years for shooting his best friend in \nthe face. His use of alcohol contributed to his actions then. It was also a factor when he \nengaged in criminal damage to private property for which his father paid the victim. \nDespite these life-changing events due, in part, to his alcohol abuse, he continues to \nuse alcohol. He admitted that he drank to intoxication within the last year. He received \nno alcohol counselling in prison and has sought none since then. Given these facts, \nnone of the above mitigating circumstances apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n \nBetween the language expressed in the general security concern in AG \u00b615 and \nthe specific concern expressed in AG \u00b616(c),6 Applicant\u2019s two criminal incidents in May \nand August 2012 raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n                                                          \n6 The record evidence is sufficient for adverse determinations under both the criminal conduct and alcohol \nconsumption guidelines, nevertheless, as a whole, Applicant\u2019s actions put into issue his judgment, \ntrustworthiness and overall personal conduct.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \nAppellant\u2019s criminal act of shooting his friend in the face and leaving him for dead \nwas not a minor incident. It casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b617(c) does not apply. Applicant completed his prison sentence and follow-up \nprobation without any issues. He has since achieved gainful employment and by all \naccounts is thriving in his job. However, because he still uses alcohol, it is too early to \ndetermine whether similar behavior is unlikely. Applicant receives some credit under AG \n\u00b6 17(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s completion \nof probation, his letters of recommendation, the testimony of the officers of his \ncompany, and his father\u2019s testimony. However, I also considered that he was convicted \nof aggravated assault when he shot his friend in the face and that alcohol was involved \nwith both criminal incidents. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate \nthe criminal conduct, alcohol consumption, and personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines J, G and E. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs   1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph     2.a: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph     3.a: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

Dorsey, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n06/26/2019 \n___________ \n \nDecision \n___________ \n \nHEINY, Claude, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana to alleviate severe back pain. He has stopped using \nmarijuana and manages his pain with medication supplied by the U.S. Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA). His financial delinquencies are being resolved and are under \ncontrol. He has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, and Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nActing under the relevant Executive Order and Department of Defense (DoD) \nDirective, on April 23, 2018, the DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and \nGuideline F, financial considerations.  \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017 pertain to this decision. \nOn June 18, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have the matter \ndecided without a hearing. On November 30, 2018, Defense Office of Hearings and \n\n   \n \n2 \n \n \nAppeals (DOHA) Department Counsel (DC) submitted the Government's case in a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM). The FORM contained five attachments (Items). Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the FORM was due on January 7, 2019. No response to the FORM has been \nreceived by DOHA. On March 6, 2019, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted, with explanation, that he used \nmarijuana with varying frequency from about April 2012 to at least July 2017. He denied \nthe three collection accounts: SOR 1.a ($9,521), SOR 1.b ($1,259), and SOR 1.c \n($1,016), which totaled approximately $11,800. After a thorough review of the pleadings \nand exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old manager of concessions at a stadium, but has accepted \na position as a technical office manager for a defense contractor if he obtains a security \nclearance. (Item 3) He is married and has a daughter age 3 and a son age 8. From April \n1999 to August 2003 he honorably served in the U.S. Marine Corps. Applicant receives \ndisability payments from the U.S. Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs (VA). He is 100 percent \ndisabled due to his service-connected disabilities. (Item 2, Tab F) He is considered totally \nand permanently disabled. The record is silent as to the amount of disability pay he \nreceives. \n \nIn 2002, while in the Marine Corps, Applicant was a Marine military police officer \nand sustained a back injury while extracting an inmate from a cell. (Item 4) He had also \nsustained a knee injury while on active duty. He suffers from degenerative disk disease \nand has chronic back pain. (Item 2) In April 2012, the VA determined he is 100 percent \ndisabled. (Item 2, Tab F) The VA had directed that Applicant obtain counseling for \ndepression and anxiety associated with his back injury. (Item 4) The VA prescribed \nVicodin to manage his pain, but the medication lessened his ability to focus on work and \nclass assignments. In May 2017, he obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree in business \nadministration. (Item 3, Item 2) The VA was unable to prescribe any alternate medication. \nIn March 2012, Applicant stopped using Vicodin because he believed he was becoming \naddicted to Vicodin. \n \nApplicant is now on a regimen of pain medication he receives through the VA. He \nwas working with his doctor to control the pain. He had used marijuana when trying to \nfind an alternative to the Vicodin and other pain medication prescribed by the VA.  \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s November 2017 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) he listed he had smoked marijuana from April 2012 through July 2017. \nHe stated,  \n \nI would use it when pain was too severe to sleep or function throughout \nthe day, and when my prescribed medication would not work. Never at \nwork or outside of my residence. It was not often . . . I have been in chronic \npain for the last 12 years and tried to manage the pain with marijuana, but \n\n   \n \n3 \n \n \nit did not help as I had hoped it would. So now I am on a regimen[] of pills \nissued by the Veterans Administration and am working with my Doctor to \nmaintain manageable pain levels, physical therapy, diet and it is working  \n. . .I have never had a problem with this drug and it is not addictive. I don\u2019t \nsee why I would need it or want it in the future. (Item 3) \n \nIn 2012, Applicant started using marijuana at night to help him sleep and when the \npain was severe. (Item 2, Item 4) He asserts when Applicant moved to his current state, \nwhich was August 2012, he stopped using marijuana and the VA prescribed him \nGabapentin, Ibuprofen, and Acetaminophen to address his back pain. (Item 3 and 4) The \ndrugs controlled the pain unless the pain became severe. He asserted that in the spring \nof 2017, he stopped using marijuana to manage his pain. (Item 2) In July 2017, he again \nstopped using marijuana. He asserts his use had no negative impacts on his life and it \nallowed him to sleep better and concentrate better on his work and school assignments. \n(Item 4) He said he was willing to sign a statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. (Item 2) \n \nApplicant did not list any financial problems or delinquencies on his e-QIP. (Item \n3) In August 2017, he switched to part-time employment due to his back pain. (Item 4) In \nAugust 2017, he started working 10 to 15 hours per week. From March 2017 to May 2017, \nin addition to his full-time job and school attendance, he also worked a second job three \nor four days a week. He ended his second job because the commute from his home state \nto the job site in another state made his back pain more severe. (Item 4)  \n \nFrom October 2013 to February 2014, Applicant was a full-time student financially \nsupported by his military disability pay and vocational rehabilitation payments. (Item 4) \nHis GI Bill benefits and disability pay also financially supported him when he was a student \nat other colleges and universities. (Item 4) From January 2009 through July 2010, he was \nunemployed due to a lack of work at his company caused by the recession. He was also \nunemployed from March 2012 until February 2013. (Items 3 and 4) From February 2013 \nto September 2013, he was a stadium operations manager. (Item 2) From April 2015 \nthrough October 2017, he was a stadium operations center supervisor. (Item 2) Since \nMarch 2017, he has also worked as a baseball video scout.  \n \nThe $9,521 collection account (SOR 2.a) resulted from the purchase of a bed in \nAugust 2007. His December 2017 credit report, lists the account which required monthly \npayments of $25 with a high credit of $2,985. (Item 5) The credit report listed a balance \non the account of $9,521 with $2,363 past due. (Item 5) He made timely payments on the \naccount until 2009, when he was unemployed. He stopped payments when other bills \nsuch as food and basic necessities took precedence. (Item 4) He anticipated becoming \ncurrent on this account once he became employed full time. However, he could not \nanticipate when the account would be satisfied. (Item 4) \n \nApplicant has employed a company to assist in resolving his debts and to improve \nhis overall financial health. (Item 2, Tab F) The company was attempting to negotiate \nsettlement of the debt. The letter from the company states, \u201cResolution Dept: Erroneous: \n\n   \n \n4 \n \n \nCorrection date: \u2018Resolution Expected no later than 5-1-2019.\u201d (Item 2, Tab H) Applicant \nhad been told by his financial assistance company that the debt was uncollectable. He \nprovided no documentation supporting this assertion. (Item 2) The account remains \ndelinquent as of the date of his SOR Response. In his SOR response he indicated the \ndebt was being actively worked and he would make all payments as directed. (Item 2, \nTab F)  \n \nApplicant had a $1,259 collection account (SOR 2.b) related to a VISA account \nopened in 2015. The account has been paid. During his December 2017 interview, he \nacknowledged the debt and said it became delinquent when other bills such as food and \nbasic necessities took precedence. (Item 4) A letter from the current creditor indicates the \naccount has been settled in full and zero is owed on the account. (Item 2, Tab H) \n \nIn September 2016, Applicant had taken his daughter to the emergency room due \nto an allergic reaction to a flu shot. In his SOR Response, he asserted he was working \nhard to correct the misunderstanding concerning the $1,016 medical collection account \n(SOR 2.c). (Item 2) When he learned of the delinquent obligation, he contacted the \nhospital and learned the claim for treatment had been sent to the VA for payment. When \nhe contacted his insurance company, he was told no claim had been submitted. (Item 4) \nThe claim was denied by his insurance company when the hospital used the wrong social \nsecurity number. (Item 4) During his December 2017 interview, he acknowledged the \ndebt, but could not say when it would be satisfied. The delinquent account is reflected in \nhis December 2017 credit report. (Item 5) In his response to the SOR, Applicant claims \nthe creditor told him the debt was erroneous, but the creditor would not provide him with \ndocumentation supporting this assertion. (Item 2) \n \nCharacter reference \n \n \nThe owner of a national baseball team has known Applicant for four-and-a-half \nyears stated Applicant is diligent, leads by example, has stellar character, and \ndemonstrates an exemplary work ethic. (Item 2, Tab D) The vice president and assistant \ngeneral manager of a national baseball team, who has known Applicant for four years, \nstated Applicant enjoys a reputation as a responsible, reliable, personable member of the \nstaff and believes Applicant to be honest, respectful, and trustworthy. The team\u2019s general \nmanager, who has known Applicant for two years, states Applicant is a great employee \nwith a tremendous work ethic and ingenuity. (Item 2, Tab D) \n \nA friend, who has known Applicant for eight years, states Applicant is dependable, \nreliable, and will do what needs to be done. A friend, roommate, and co-worker, who has \nknown Applicant for 11 years, stated Applicant is generous, hospitable, with integrity and \nhigh standards. A friend, who has known Applicant for 20 years, indicated Applicant is \ndedicated to his friends and family and is diligent and honorable. (Item 2, Tab D) A \ncoworker, who has known Applicant for more than three years, stated Applicant is a \ndedicated worker, who has the highest character, and is always willing to go the extra \nmile for someone in need. He stated Applicant is very organized, detail-oriented, \nprepared, who has a tremendous ability to connect with people and earn their respect \n\n   \n \n5 \n \n \nand trust. (Item 2, Tab D) A friend, who has known Applicant for 28 years, stated Applicant \nis honest, loyal, and a person who puts his whole heart and soul into the people and \nactivities in his life.  \n \nIn March 2002, Applicant received a letter of appreciation from the commanding \nofficer of the naval consolidated brig commending Applicant for his superb dedication and \noutstanding devotion to duty. (Item 2, Tab D) A co-worker, who worked with Applicant at \nthe correction facility brig, stated Applicant was a fair and impartial correctional officer \nwho was assigned to the special quarters wing that housed the most violent and \ndangerous offenders due to Applicant\u2019s demeanor and confidence. (Item 2, Tab D) In \nFebruary 2003, he received a certificate of completion in recognition of his continued \nprofessional development for completion of the 40 hour train the trainer course. (Item 2, \nTab I) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n   \n \n6 \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are \narticulated in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d is established \nbecause of Appellant\u2019s marijuana use. From April 2012 to July 2017, he used marijuana, \nwhich he acknowledged on his November 2017 e-QIP. His last use of marijuana is almost \ntwo years ago. He used marijuana to assist in relieving his back pain.  \n \nIn 2002, while in the Marine Corps, Applicant was a Marine military police officer \nand sustained a back injury while extracting an inmate from a cell. He also sustained a \nknee injury while on active duty and suffers from degenerative disk disease resulting in \nchronic back pain. The VA rated his disability at 100 percent. He has suffered from chronic \nback pain for more than 12 years. The VA prescribed Vicodin to manage his pain, but the \nmedication lessened his ability to focus on work and class assignments. The VA was \nunable to prescribe any alternate medication. In March 2012, Applicant stopped using \nVicodin because he believed he was becoming addicted to Vicodin.  \n \nWhen his pain was too severe to sleep or function throughout the day and his \nprescribed medication would not address the pain, he turned to smoking marijuana. The \nmarijuana did not help as he had hoped it would. In July 2017, he stopped using marijuana \n\n   \n \n7 \n \n \nand went on a regimen of pills issued by the VA. He is working with his doctor to maintain \nmanageable pain levels through physical therapy, diet, and medication.  \n \nIn 2012, Applicant started using marijuana at night to help him sleep and when the \npain was severe. He asserts when he moved to his current state, which was August 2012, \nhe stopped using marijuana. At that time, the VA prescribed him Gabapentin, Ibuprofen, \nand Acetaminophen to address his back pain. (Item 3 and 4) The drugs controlled the \npain unless the pain became severe. He asserted that in July 2017, he stopped using \nmarijuana to manage his pain. He asserts he sees no reason to use it in the future. He is \nwilling to sign a statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse.  \n \nHis use of marijuana was Applicant\u2019s attempt to find an alternative to the Vicodin \nand other pain medication prescribed by the VA, which he believed were leading to \naddiction.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) provides for mitigation when the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Although, his use was not infrequent, it \nended almost two years ago. Additionally, he is unlikely to use marijuana in the future \nnow that medication provided by the VA addresses his back pain.  \n \nThere are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The \ndetermination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within \nthe parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. \nAug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 \nmonths before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must \ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is applicability because Applicant acknowledges his drug involvement, \nand there is no evidence that he currently associates with drug-using associates and \ncontacts. AG \u00b6 26(b) provides: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n\n   \n \n8 \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s self-reporting of his marijuana involvement is evidence of good \ncharacter. He stated he was willing to sign a statement of intent to abstain from marijuana \nuse. He no longer uses marijuana and sees no reason to use it in the future. Applicant \nhas established a sufficient pattern of abstinence to mitigate the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides \nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. \n \nApplicant had three accounts placed for collection totaling $11,795. AG \u00b6 19 \nincludes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern any may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts \nregardless of the ability to do so;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c). The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \n\n   \n \n9 \n \n \nBd. Sept. 22, 2005)). Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of explanation, \nextenuation, or mitigation to overcome the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant made timely payments on his debt until he became unemployed in 2009. \nHis December 2017 credit report listed 11 accounts as being paid as agreed. In 2009, he \nstopped making payment on some of his debts when other bills such as food and basic \nnecessities took precedence. He has paid one debt (SOR 2.b, $1,259) and a second debt \n(SOR 2.c, $1,016), a medical debt, resulted when the bill was not submitted correctly by \nthe health provider. He has health insurance coverage. The medical provider used an \nincorrect social security number resulting in a bill not being paid. The medical provider \nacknowledged the error and stated the debt is no longer owed. He is working with a \nfinancial correction company to address the last debt (SOR 2.a, $9,521). He is willing to \nmake all payments on the debt as directed. He has worked both full-time and part-time \njobs at the same time to address his finances. \nApplicant had three delinquent debts which indicates the conduct was infrequent. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has some applicability. AG \u00b6 20(b) also applies. Being unemployed is a \ncondition beyond his control as was his daughter\u2019s allergic reaction to a flu shot. He had \nmedical insurance and the debt resulted from the medical provider using incorrect \ninformation in their attempt to receive payment. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the debt in SOR \n2.b, which has been paid. He has one delinquent obligation yet to be addressed, which \nhe intends to pay. Based on him having addressed the other two debts, but more \nimportantly this believe is based on his character as described in the reference letters, I \nbelieve this debt will be paid. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n   \n \n10 \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable active duty service in the U.S. Marine \nCorps that resulting in him being rated as 100 percent disabled by the VA. His military \nservice merits considerable respect. He received a letter of appreciation from the \ncommanding officer of the naval consolidated brig commending him for his superb \ndedication and outstanding devotion to duty. A co-worker, who worked with him at the \ncorrection facility brig, stated Applicant was a fair and impartial correctional officer who \nwas assigned to the special quarters wing that housed the most violent and dangerous \noffenders due to Applicant\u2019s demeanor and confidence.  \n \nThe character evaluations of supervisors and coworkers are important and often \nmore accurate because they have observed Applicant over longer periods of time and \nunder a variety of events and stresses. The owner of a national baseball team, who has \nknown Applicant for four-and-a-half years stated Applicant is diligent, led by example, has \nstellar character, and demonstrated an exemplary work ethic. The vice president and \nassistant general manager of the nation baseball teams, who has known Applicant for \nfour years, stated Applicant enjoys a reputation as a responsible, reliable, personable \nmember of the staff and believes Applicant to be honest, respectful, and trustworthy. The \nteam\u2019s general manager, who has known Applicant for two years, states Applicant is a \ngreat employee with a tremendous work ethic and ingenuity. \n \nApplicant\u2019s friends and coworker indicated Applicant is a dedicated worker, \ndependable, reliable, generous, hospitable, is willing to do what needs to be done, with \nintegrity and high standards. They state he is very organized, detail-oriented, thorough, \nprepared, who has a tremendous ability to connect with people and earn their respect \nand trust and always willing to go the extra mile for someone in need. They stated he is \na person who puts his whole heart and soul into the people and activities in his life. \n \nApplicant has stated he stopped using marijuana in 2017 and will not use it in the \nfuture. His use of marijuana did not work as well as he had hoped and he now has a \nmedical regimen through the VA to address his chronic back pain. I find for him as to drug \n\n   \n \n11 \n \n \ninvolvement and substance misuse. As to financial considerations, the issue is not simply \nwhether all the delinquent obligations have been paid \u2014 it is whether his financial \ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & \n2(c)). Two of the three delinquent obligations have been addressed and Applicant \nindicated he intends to pay the last debt. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigate the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and financial considerations concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H, drug involvement  \nand substance misuse:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \n \nFor Applicant.  \n \nParagraph 2, Financial Considerations:  \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n08/19/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate his history of \nfinancial problems. It is too soon to tell if Applicant will follow through and resolve more \nthan $136,000 in delinquent debt. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non August 30, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on July 3, 2018, after reviewing the application and \nthe information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 19, 2018. Of the 11 delinquent financial \naccounts alleged in the SOR, he admitted 8 and denied 3. His denials acknowledged \nthe debts and explained he was making progress in resolving those three debts. He \nalso provided a lengthy explanation of extenuating circumstances, stating that the root \ncause of his financial problems was a failed investment in a 31-unit apartment complex, \nwhich is discussed further below. He requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge.  \n  \nThe case was assigned to me on September 24, 2018. The hearing took place \non December 6, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department Counsel \noffered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-5. Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-D. Other than Applicant, no \nwitnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on December 13, \n2018. \n \nThe record was kept open for approximately 30 days, until January 4, 2019, to \nprovide Applicant an opportunity to submit additional documentation in support of his \ncase. (Tr. 24, 56-57) Applicant made timely submissions, by e-mail, and those four \ndocuments are admitted without objections as Exhibit E.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \nthat he has held for many years. He works in the areas of design and development for a \ncompany in the defense industry. His place of work is a military proving ground. Except \nfor about four months in 2017, he has worked for the same company since 2002. His \nannual salary is about $80,000. (Tr. 67-69) His formal education includes an associate\u2019s \ndegree awarded in 2000 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronic engineering awarded in \n2002. He earned both degrees while working full time. Married since 1992, he and his \nspouse have a 20-year-old child who lives with them while attending college. Applicant\u2019s \nbackground includes honorable service in the U.S. Air Force during 1990-1994.  \n \nApplicant admits a history of financial problems, which is also established by the \ndocumentary evidence. (Exhibits 1, 3, and 4) In particular, the SOR concerns 11 \ndelinquent accounts, in collection, charged off, or past due, in amounts ranging from \n$192 to $48,039 for a total of about $144,000.  \n \nAs mentioned above, Applicant attributed his history of financial problems to a \nfailed investment in a 31-unit apartment complex. (Exhibit D; Tr. 41-49) Applicant and \nhis spouse, through their limited liability company, bought the apartment complex in July \n2010 for a purchase price of $478,854 with a down payment of $80,000 due at closing. \nApplicant made the $80,000 down payment through a combination of cash, equity, and \nborrowed money. For example, the $34,608 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.i stems from \nmoney borrowed for the purchase. (Tr. 64-66) The deal was seller financed, and \nApplicant made monthly mortgage payments to the seller. The investment failed \nrelatively quickly. In June 2013, Applicant sold the apartment complex for $5,000, and \nthe buyer assumed the note with the initial seller.  \n\n \n3 \n \nBoth in his answer to the SOR and during his hearing testimony, Applicant \nprovided a consistent explanation for the failed investment. Due to its clarity and \ncompleteness, the majority of his answer is quoted below: \n \nThe intent of this statement is to serve as an explanation of extenuating \ncircumstances that caused my otherwise impeccable credit rating to fall \ninto a state of disrepair. Over the past 12 years I have invested in rental \nproperty, including a 3-bedroom house, a 2-bedroom house, a 2-bedoom \ncondominium, and a 1-bedroom house, all located in [the same small city \nin a neighboring state], and a 31-unit apartment complex located in [a \nmajor city in the same neighboring state]. Those properties, with the \nexception of the apartment complex, have proven to be excellent \ninvestments. The apartment complex is the root of my financial downfall. \nApproximately 6 years ago a neighboring property entered into foreclosure \nand sat vacant for several months. This derelict property attracted drug \ndealers, prostitution, and other illicit activity. These issues spilled over \nonto my property, causing my occupancy rate to drop below 50%. This \nrequired me to subsidize the apartment complex through personal funds. \nWith fixed costs at $5,000 per month for mortgage payments and \ninsurance, plus variable costs for repairs and maintenance, coupled with \nvery little incoming revenue, the situation quickly and severely negatively \nimpacted my personal finances. I have since sold this property. When I \npurchased the apartment complex I paid an $80,000 down payment. \nWhen I sold the apartment complex I received a check for $5,000, but I \nconsidered myself fortunate to get out from under the ongoing issues and \nthe exorbitant expenses related to this property. I am now on the road to \nfinancial recovery, but the effects are lasting and positive progress will \ntake time.  \n \nApplicant has made some progress in resolving the delinquent accounts in the \nSOR, and he presented supporting documentation to establish that progress. (Exhibits \nA-C) The $3,531 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.e was resolved through a payment \narrangement calling for a series of payments for a total of $2,000 made during 2018. \n(Exhibit C; Tr. 60-61). The $4,427 past-due account for a mortgage loan on one of his \nrental properties in SOR \u00b6 1.h was current as of July 2018. (Exhibit B; Tr. 61-63) The \naccount had become past due again, due to some unexpected expenses, at the time of \nthe December 2018 hearing, but Applicant anticipated the account would be current by \nJanuary 2019. The unexpected expenses were three dental bills and additional college \ntuition above and beyond the normal amount paid by scholarship funding. (Exhibit E)  \nThe $192 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.k was paid in full in January 2018. (Exhibit A; \nTr. 66-67)  \n \nOtherwise, Applicant stated that there were no changes to the unresolved status \nof the other eight delinquent financial accounts in the SOR. (Tr. 55-67). For example, \nthe $48,039 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.a stems from a line of credit he had on his \nprimary residence; the home was foreclosed in 2016; the debt was charged off; and he \nhas not made any payments on the account in several years. (Tr. 37-40, 55, 58-60; \n\n \n4 \n \nExhibit 4 at 3) Likewise, the $38,349 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.b stems from a \n$44,564 loan used to purchase a pickup truck; the vehicle was repossessed; the loan \nbalance was charged off in November 2014; and he has done nothing on the debt since \nthe repossession. (Tr. 55-57; Exhibit 3 at 3) In sum, he did not submit documentation to \nestablish that any of the eight delinquent debts were paid, settled, in a payment \narrangement, in dispute, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved. I specifically find \nthat those eight delinquent accounts are unresolved.  \n \nApplicant considered seeking relief via bankruptcy and consulted a bankruptcy \nattorney in 2015, but elected to not pursue that course of action. (Answer; Tr. 71-72) \nConcerning the delinquent debts, he stated that he made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d in \naddressing the indebtedness during 2017. (Tr. 61-62) He stated that he caught up on \nback taxes owed to state and federal tax authorities, vehicle payments, and mortgage \nloan payments for their rental properties. His progress slowed in 2018 due to a gap in \npay related from his transition from a subcontractor to full-time employee. At present, \nApplicant stated he was current with his monthly rent payment and other living \nexpenses, but was a couple of months behind on mortgage payments for the rental \nproperties. (Tr. 69-71)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n                                                          \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are traceable \nto the failed investment in the 31-unit apartment complex in a neighboring state, which \nhe bought in 2010 and sold about three years later in 2013. In considering this matter, I \nnote that every financial investment (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, silver, etc.) \ncarries a certain level of risk. Some investments have more risk than others. Applicant \nassumed a fair degree of risk when he bought the apartment complex. He likely \noverextended himself given size of transaction, the size of the apartment complex, and \nthe location of the apartment complex, which was hundreds of miles from his primary \nresidence.  \n \n \nNevertheless, the investment did not fail due to Applicant\u2019s mismanagement or \nneglect of the property. The investment failed due to problems with the next-door \nproperty, which spilled over and negatively impacted his property. Those circumstances \nwere largely beyond his control. He acted reasonably under the circumstances by \nselling the property. Although he sold the failing investment property several years ago \nin 2013, the financial hangover persists to this day, as evidenced by the remaining eight \ndelinquent accounts for more than $136,000. Given these circumstances, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, in part, but Applicant does not receive full credit in \nmitigation.  \n \n \nIt is too soon to tell if Applicant initiated and is adhering to \u201ca good-faith effort\u201d to \nresolve his substantial indebtedness. With that said, he receives credit for the progress \nhe made in 2017 with back taxes, vehicle payments, and mortgage loans. He also \nreceives credit for the remedial actions taken as reflected in Exhibits A, B, and C. But \nApplicant is still facing a small mountain of delinquent debt, more than $136,000. It is \nhard to tell if he can formulate a realistic plan and then follow through on that plan to \naddress his delinquent debts. At present, it is unlikely that Applicant will resolve the \nremaining delinquent debts in the foreseeable future. In light of the high-dollar amount \nand age of some of the debts, it is unlikely those debts will ever be paid. Given these \ncircumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. In particular, I gave \nApplicant credit for his honorable military service and his many years of employment in \nthe defense industry. Although Applicant presented some favorable evidence in \nmitigation, it was outweighed by the unfavorable evidence. I conclude that he has not \nmet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j: Against Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e, 1.h, 1k: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Folks, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Troy L. Nussbaum, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the personal conduct security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 23, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline E, personal \nconduct. Applicant responded to the SOR on June 28, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  \nThe case was assigned to me on January 9, 2019. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 18, 2019, \nscheduling the hearing for March 7, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled.  \n03/28/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nEvidence \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. The objections to GE 5 and 8 are sustained. See Directive, Additional \nProcedural Guidance, \u00b6 E.3.1.20; ISCR Case No. 02-12199 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2004); \nand ISCR Case No. 02-12199 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). The objections to GE 6 and 7 \nare overruled and the exhibits are admitted. See Directive, Additional Procedural \nGuidance, \u00b6 E.3.1.22; Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 (App. \nBd. Aug. 8, 2005); and ISCR Case No. 10-08390 (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 2012). \n \nApplicant testified, called six witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) \nA through C and AA through CC. AE A through C and AA through BB were admitted \nwithout objection. AE CC was admitted over Department Counsel\u2019s objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 2002 \nuntil he was honorably discharged in 2011. He seeks to retain a security clearance, \nwhich he has held since he was in the military. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, awarded in \n2016, and he attended graduate school in pursuit of a master\u2019s degree. He has never \nmarried, but he and his fianc\u00e9 have cohabitated since about 2008. He does not have \nchildren.1 \n \n \nApplicant had a difficult childhood. His father was not in his life, but he was raised \nby his mother and stepfather, who he refers to as his father. His parents smoked \nmarijuana. His stepfather sold marijuana and occasionally cocaine. Applicant started \nsmoking marijuana when he was about 12 or 13 years old. He started smoking \nmarijuana with his mother when he was about 16 years old. He completed one year of \ncollege after high school. He worked and occasionally sold marijuana. He came home \none day and found that his home had been burglarized and ransacked. He decided he \nneeded a change in his life and joined the U.S. military in 2002 at the age of 22.2 \n \n \nApplicant was stationed overseas from 2003 through 2006. He deployed to Iraq \nfrom October 2003 to July 2004 and from September 2007 to January 2008. In about \nDecember 2004, Applicant was home visiting his mother and stepfather. His stepfather \nhad been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. His stepfather smoked \nmarijuana to help manage his pain. He asked Applicant to smoke marijuana with him, \nwhich Applicant did on one occasion. Applicant again smoked marijuana with some \nfriends about a day later. He held a top secret security clearance with access to \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI) at the time. His marijuana use was not \ndetected by the military.3 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 31, 38, 43-45, 102-103; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE AA. \n \n2 Tr. at 32-38, 79-80; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n3 Tr. at 40-41, 46-47, 54, 80-81; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE AA. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was coming to terms with his sexuality when he had his first \nhomosexual relationship with a foreign national in about 2004.4 The foreign national was \nemotionally and physically abusive to Applicant. The foreign national pushed Applicant \nto use cocaine, which he did on about five to six occasions in 2005. He held a top secret \nsecurity clearance with access to SCI at the time. These were the only occasions \nApplicant ever used any illegal drugs other than marijuana. His cocaine use went \nundetected by the military.5 \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nAugust 2009, while he was still in the military. He did not report any illegal drug use in \nthe previous seven years, and he did not report his marijuana and cocaine use while \nholding a security clearance.6 \n \nApplicant submitted another SF 86 in November 2014. He answered \u201cno\u201d to the \nquestion that asked if he had ever illegally used a drug while possessing a security \nclearance.7  \n \nApplicant submitted a third SF 86 in February 2015. He answered \u201cyes\u201d to the \nquestion that asked if he had ever illegally used a drug while possessing a security \nclearance. He reported marijuana use in May 2005. He wrote that he \u201c[s]moke[d] \nmarijuana once with [his] friends after coming back from deployment . . . .\u201d He did not \nreport that he used cocaine in 2005 while he held a security clearance.8   \n \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to SCI was denied by a government agency in \nMay 2016. He submitted a fourth SF 86 in July 2017. He reported his marijuana and \ncocaine use in 2004 to 2005.9 He wrote: \n \nThere will be a discrepancy in this answer on my last SF86 and it is \nbecause I did not notice the question was asking for \u201cEVER\u201d instead of a \ntime period. I had also forgotten about the incidents because they are over \n12 years old and it wasn\u2019t until I was undergoing a full scope polygraph \nthat I started to remember the incidents.10 \n                                                          \n4 The adjudicative guidelines specifically state that \u201c[n]o adverse inference concerning the standards in \nthis Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\u201d AG \u00b6 12. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual orientation is not relevant to a determination of his security worthiness. It is discussed \nhere solely because Applicant specifically addressed it as part of the reason he \u201cburied\u201d his illegal drug \nuse and did not remember it when he completed Questionnaires for National Security Positions. \n \n5 Tr. at 36-37, 47-54, 81-82, 180. \n \n6 GE 3. \n \n7 GE 2. \n \n8 GE 4. \n \n9 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 6, 7. \n \n10 GE 1. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant denied intentionally providing false information on any of the SF 86s. \nHe stated that he did not remember the drug use when he filled out the questionnaires. \nHe stated that he buried the incident with his stepfather \u201cbecause of what it meant and \nhow much it hurt to come back after being gone a year.\u201d He stated that he also forgot \nabout smoking marijuana with his friends because it all happened on the same \nweekend, and he \u201clooked at it as one situation.\u201d He also buried the cocaine use \nbecause it was associated with an abusive relationship.11  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s stepfather passed away in 2010. At some point after his stepfather \npassed away, Applicant told his fianc\u00e9 that he smoked marijuana with his stepfather. \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 helped him fill out the 2015 SF 86. Applicant stated that he had \nforgotten about his marijuana use in 2004. It was his fianc\u00e9 who reminded him that he \nsmoked marijuana with his stepfather. He stated that he did not report the cocaine use \non that questionnaire because he did not remember it.12    \n \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s testimony was consistent with Applicant\u2019s testimony. He \nhelped Applicant fill out the 2015 SF 86. He testified that Applicant looked confused like \nhe did not remember when he reminded Applicant of his marijuana use with his \nstepfather. He believes Applicant is an honest and truthful person. He completely \nbelieves Applicant\u2019s testimony that he did not report his drug use because he forgot \nabout it.13   \n \n \nApplicant stated that he only remembered the cocaine use when he was being \nquestioned about his foreign contacts in a pre-polygraph interview for the government \nagency. While discussing his foreign boyfriend, the interviewer asked him if they ever \nused drugs, which triggered his memory that they used cocaine, and he divulged that \ninformation to the interviewer.14 \n \nApplicant spent two years in Afghanistan working for a defense contractor in \nsupport of the U.S. forces. He regularly volunteers in his community. He submitted \ndocuments and letters, and he called six witnesses who attested to his excellent job \nperformance in the military and in his current job. He is praised for his trustworthiness, \ntechnical expertise, honesty, reliability, moral character, patriotism, work ethic, \ndedication, judgment, maturity, professionalism, leadership, loyalty, and integrity. His \nwitnesses are all aware of the allegations in the SOR. They completely believe \nApplicant\u2019s statements and testimony that he did not report his marijuana and cocaine \nuse because he forgot about it. They recommend that he retain his security clearance.15 \n \n                                                          \n11 Tr. at 62-67, 75-76, 84-90; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n12 Tr. at 60, 65, 68, 72-75, 92-94; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE C. \n \n13 Tr. at 104-121; AE C. \n \n14 Tr. at 67, 75-78, 90-92; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.  \n \n15 Tr. at 123-176; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE C, BB. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana and cocaine in 2004 and 2005 while he was in the \nmilitary and holding a security clearance. That conduct reflects questionable judgment \nand an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant did not report his drug use on SF 86s submitted in 2009 and 2014, and \nhe did not report the full extent of his drug use on a 2015 SF 86. He denied intentionally \nproviding false information on the SF 86s. He asserted that he did not remember his \ndrug use when he filled out the questionnaires.  \n\n \n7 \n \nI have considered all the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s and his fianc\u00e9\u2019s \ntestimony, his strong character evidence, and his witnesses\u2019 belief that he told the truth. \nI also considered his motive to falsify, particularly in 2009, while he was still in the \nmilitary; the two explanations given in the 2017 SF 86 (\u201cI did not notice the question was \nasking for \u2018EVER\u2019 instead of a time period [and] I had also forgotten about the \nincidents\u201d); and the inherent improbability that he would forget these significant events.  \n \nI did not find Applicant\u2019s explanation to be credible. I do not believe that \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use while in the military blended in with his extensive marijuana \nuse before he joined the military. Illegal drug use is a significant event in the military, \nand not one that is quickly forgotten. Additionally, Applicant never used cocaine except \nwhile he was in the military. Again, that is an event not likely to be forgotten. Applicant \nasserted that he used marijuana and cocaine in 2004 to 2005; forgot about it when he \nsubmitted his 2009 SF 86, while he was still in the military; remembered his marijuana \nuse and told his fianc\u00e9 at some point after his stepfather passed away in 2010; forgot \nabout it again until he was reminded of his marijuana use by his fianc\u00e9 in 2015; and only \nremembered the cocaine use when he was being questioned about his foreign contacts \nin a pre-polygraph interview for the government agency. I am convinced by substantial \nevidence16 that Applicant intentionally provided false information about the extent of his \nillegal drug use on the three SF 86s. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n                                                          \n16 Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the \nweight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal \nMaritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than \na preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994); ISCR \nCase No. 04-07187 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2006). \n\n \n8 \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use is mitigated by time and the absence of any additional \ndrug use. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are concluded for Applicant. \n \n \nApplicant has consistently denied that he lied on the SF 86s. Having determined \nthat he intentionally omitted information in an attempt to mislead the government, I have \nalso determined that his explanations that the omissions were unintentional were also \nfalse. It would be inconsistent to find his conduct mitigated.17   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n                                                          \n17 See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance: \n \nOnce the Administrative Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified a security \nclearance application in September 2002, the Judge could not render a favorable security \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n\n \n9 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nI also considered Applicant\u2019s honorable military service, particularly his \ndeployments, and his excellent character evidence. I can see why he has such strong \nsupport from those around him, both professionally and personally. I believe Applicant is \nan otherwise honest person who felt he had to lie in 2009 while he was still in the \nmilitary. He was then stuck with the lie, was unable to extricate himself from it, and felt \nhe had to propagate it. Unfortunately, at this time, he cannot be trusted to tell the truth.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nForeman, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has mitigated the eligibility concerns about his alcohol abuse. He has \nnot mitigated the eligibility concerns raised by his criminal conduct. CAC eligibility is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing concerns about his eligibility for a Common \nAccess Card (CAC). The DOD acted under Homeland Security Presidential Directive \n12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors \n(August 27, 2004); the Adjudicative Standards in DoD Instruction 5200.46, DoD \nInvestigative and Adjudicative Guidance for Issuing the Common Access Card \n(September 9, 2014) (Instruction); and the procedures set out in Enclosure 3 of DoD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The SOR alleges eligibility concerns under \nthe Supplemental Adjudicative Standards (SAS) set out in Enclosure 4, Appendix 2 of \nthe Instruction. The specific concerns were alleged under SAS 2 (Criminal or Dishonest \nConduct or Financial Responsibility) and SAS 4 (Alcohol Abuse).  \n02/25/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 27, 2018, and requested a decision \non the written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on October 11, 2018. On October 12, 2018, a complete copy \nof the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on October 23, 2018, and he did not \nrespond. The case was assigned to me on February 12, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g, 2.b, and 2.c, and he \nadmitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a in part. His admissions are incorporated \nin my findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old carpenter employed by a defense contractor since \nFebruary 2017. He was unemployed from May 2015 until he began his current job. He \ndid not complete high school, but he obtained his GED certificate in April 1983. \n \n \nIn October 1987, Applicant was convicted of receiving stolen property worth more \nthan $100, a felony. The record does not reflect the sentence imposed. (FORM Item 4 \nat 5.) \n \n \nIn January 1990, Applicant was charged with receiving stolen property worth \nmore than $100. In July 1990, he was convicted of the lesser offense of receiving stolen \nproperty worth less than $100, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to confinement for \n90 days (suspended), and he was placed on probation for two years. (FORM Item 4 at \n7-8.) \n \n \nIn April 1990, Applicant was charged with two counts of 2nd degree assault \n(felonies), armed criminal action (a felony), damaging property, and resisting arrest. He \nwas convicted of 2nd degree assault, and the remaining charges were dismissed. He \nwas sentenced to confinement for three years (suspended), and placed on probation for \nfive years. (FORM Item 4 at 8-9.) \n \n \nIn August 1990, Applicant was charged with stealing and 2nd degree assault \n(both felonies). In his answer to the SOR, he stated that these charges arose from the \nsame incident as the April 1990 2nd degree assault and the October 1987 charge of \nreceiving stolen property. (FORM Item 4 at 10-11.) The record contains insufficient \nevidence to determine if the August 1990 and April 1990 charges are duplicates.  \n \n \nIn January 1996, Applicant was charged with possession of a controlled \nsubstance, a felony. He was convicted and sentenced to confinement for two years \n(suspended) and placed on probation for two years. (FORM Item 4 at 12-13.) In his \nanswer to the SOR, he stated that he was walking through a bad part of town when a \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) (FORM Item 2) unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n \n\n \n3 \nperson who was \u201cstrung out\u201d approached him and then ran away from an approaching \npolice officer and threw a small quantity of crack cocaine onto the ground in front of him. \nThe police charged Applicant with possession of cocaine, and he pleaded guilty to a \nmisdemeanor drug offense.  \n \n \nIn February 1997, Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). \nThe police records do not reflect the disposition of this charge. (FORM Item 4 at 13.) In \nhis answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he pleaded guilty even though the \nbreathalyzer was not administered properly, and the offense was expunged from his \nrecord after he attended the court-ordered classes and completed a period of \nunsupervised probation. \n \n \nIn November 2000. Applicant was charged with DWI. He was convicted and \nplaced on probation for 24 months. (FORM Item 4 at 14.) In his answer to the SOR, \nApplicant stated that he drove while intoxicated to leave a \u201cviolent atmosphere.\u201d \n \n \nIn July 2014, Applicant was charged with assault and domestic violence. He was \nconvicted of domestic violence. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that the incident \noccurred when an ex-girlfriend came to his home to retrieve her laptop and became \nverbally abusive. He ordered her to leave, and she continued to be loud and abusive \noutside the home. He \u201chalf punched\u201d and slammed her car door and broke the glass in \nthe door. After his ex-girlfriend left, the police came to his home and arrested him for \ndomestic assault and malicious property damage. He pleaded guilty to domestic assault \nand paid for the damage to the car. \n \n \nIn July 2016, Applicant took his girlfriend\u2019s car without her knowledge, ran off the \nroad, and struck a concrete barrier, causing extensive damage. He drove it to another \nlocation in an effort to hide it. When he was interviewed by police several hours later, \nthe police noticed an odor of alcohol. He pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an \naccident with property damage exceeding $1,000. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant \ndenied consuming alcohol before wrecking the car, but he admitted consuming alcohol \nafterwards.  \n \nPolicies \n \nEvery CAC eligibility decision must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense \ndecision based on all available evidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The specific \nconcerns, standards, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating circumstances are listed in \nthe Instruction, Enclosure 4, Appendix 1, Basic Adjudicative Standards (BAS), and \nAppendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards (SAS). The overriding factor for CAC \neligibility decisions is \u201cunacceptable risk,\u201d which is defined as follows: \n \nA threat to the life, safety, or health of employees, contractors, vendors, or \nvisitors; to the U.S. Government physical assets or information systems; to \npersonal property; to records, including classified, privileged, proprietary, \nfinancial, and medical records, or to the privacy rights established by The \n\n \n4 \nPrivacy Act of 1974, as amended, or other law that is deemed \nunacceptable when making risk management determinations. \n \n(Instruction, Glossary, Part II at 28.) \n \nThe objective of the CAC credentialing process is the fair-minded commonsense \nassessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an \nacceptable risk to have CAC eligibility. A CAC will not be issued if there is a reasonable \nbasis to believe that issuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk. Each case must be \njudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and \napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.  \n \nFactors to be applied consistently to all information available include: (1) the \nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; \n(3) the recency and frequency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) contributing external conditions; and (6) the absence or \npresence of efforts towards rehabilitation. (Instruction, Enclosure 4, paragraph 1.b.)  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain CAC eligibility.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nSAS \u00b6 2, Criminal or Dishonest Conduct \n \n \nSAS \u00b6 2 provides, \u201cA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a \nreasonable basis to believe, based on the individual\u2019s criminal or dishonest \nconduct, that issuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk.\u201d The concern under \nthis standard is set out in SAS \u00b6 2.a:  \n \nAn individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about his or her reliability or trustworthiness and may put \npeople, property, or information systems at risk. An individual\u2019s past \ncriminal or dishonest conduct may put people, property or information \nsystems at risk. \n \n \n \nThe evidence is sufficient to establish the following disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: \n \nSAS \u00b6 2.b(1): A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses which put \nthe safety of people at risk or threaten the protection of property or \ninformation. . . ;  \n\n \n5 \nSAS \u00b6 2.b(2): Charges or admission of criminal conduct relating to the \nsafety of people and proper protection of property or information systems, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted, or convicted; \n \nSAS \u00b6 2.b(3): Dishonest acts (e.g., theft, accepting bribes, falsifying \nclaims, perjury, forgery, or attempting to obtain identity documentation \nwithout proper authorization); and \n \nSAS \u00b6 2.b(5): Actions involving violence or sexual behavior of a criminal \nnature that poses an unacceptable risk if access is granted to federally-\ncontrolled facilities and federally-controlled information systems. For \nexample, convictions for sexual assault may indicate that granting a CAC \nposes an unacceptable risk to the life and safety of persons on U.S. \nGovernment facilities. \n \n \nThe following mitigating circumstances are potentially relevant: \n \nSAS \u00b6 2.c(1): The behavior happened so long ago, was minor in nature, or \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur; \nand \n \nSAS \u00b6 2.c(4): Evidence has been supplied of successful rehabilitation, \nincluding but not limited to remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, constructive community involvement, \nor passage of time without recurrence.  \n \n \nNeither mitigating condition is established. The offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1-\n1.g happened many years ago, but they reflect a pattern of criminal conduct from 1987 \nuntil recently, in July 2016. Several were felonies, and they did not occur under unusual \ncircumstances. Applicant submitted no evidence regarding his employment record or \nany community involvement. \n \nSAS 4, Alcohol Abuse \n \n \nSAS 4 provides, \u201cA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable \nbasis to believe, based on the nature or duration of the individual\u2019s alcohol abuse \nwithout evidence of substantial rehabilitation, that issuance of a CAC poses an \nunacceptable risk.\u201d The concern under this standard is set out in SAS 4a:  \n \nAn individual\u2019s abuse of alcohol may put people, property, or information \nsystems at risk. Alcohol abuse can lead to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or failure to control impulses, and may put people, property, or \ninformation systems at risk, regardless of whether he or she is diagnosed \nas an abuser of alcohol or alcohol dependent. A person\u2019s long-term abuse \nof alcohol without evidence of substantial rehabilitation may indicate that \ngranting a CAC poses an unacceptable risk in a U.S. Government facility. \n\n \n6 \n \nThe disqualifying condition in SAS \u00b6 4.b(1) (\u201cA pattern of alcohol-related arrests\u201d) \nis relevant. However, it is not established. Applicant was not charged with DWI after the \naccident in January 2016. While the police noticed an odor of alcohol when they \ninterviewed him several hours after the accident, there is no evidence that he was \nintoxicated. The incidents in 1997 and 2000 happened three years apart, have not been \nrepeated, and are insufficient to establish a \u201cpattern\u201d of alcohol-related arrests or \u201clong-\nterm abuse of alcohol.\u201d No other disqualifying conditions under this guideline are \nestablished by the evidence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nSAS \u00b6 2, Criminal or Dishonest Conduct:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSAS 4, Alcohol Abuse: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I \nconclude that issuing Applicant a CAC would pose an unacceptable risk. CAC eligibility \nis denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

These exhibits were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. She also offered the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice regarding \nthe Republic of China, also known as Taiwan. I marked the Government\u2019s request as \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I. Department Counsel provided a copy of her letter to Applicant, \ndated December 7, 2018, with which she enclosed copies of GE 1 and 2 and HE 1. I \nmarked Department Counsel\u2019s \u201cDiscovery Letter\u201d as HE II. At the hearing, Applicant was \nuncertain whether he had received HE I. I gave him until January 17, 2019, to determine \nif he had received the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice prior to the hearing \nand to review it and raise any objections he may have. He made no further response, as \nnoted by Department Counsel in an email addressed to me and Applicant, dated January \n24, 2019, which I marked as HE III.1 On May 30, 2019, I wrote to Department Counsel to \nconfirm again that she had not received a post-hearing submission from Applicant after \nthe January 10, 2019 hearing, which she did the same day. I marked this correspondence \nas HE V. I conclude that Applicant had ample notice and opportunity to review HE I and \nto raise any objections. Accordingly, I also conclude he waived any objections to the \nGovernment\u2019s request for administrative notice.  \n \nApplicant testified at the hearing, but offered no documentary evidence, and \nthough I gave him the opportunity to present documentary evidence or to supplement the \nrecord evidence after the hearing, he failed to do so. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on January 25, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice  \n \nAs noted, Department Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts about Taiwan. (HE 1) The facts administratively noticed are summarized in \nthe Findings of Fact, below. \n \n                                                          \n1 In the Discovery Letter (HE II), Applicant was advised as follows: \u201cBring the enclosed documents, the \nStatement of Reasons, and your response to the Statement of Reasons to the hearing.\u201d (Emphasis \nin the original.) He was also advised in a December 12, 2018 email from a member of DOHA\u2019s staff as \nfollows: IMPORTANT: You should have received an EVIDENTIARY PACKAGE from the Department \nCounsel by now. On the day of your hearing, please bring the EVIDENTIARY PACKAGE with the attached \ngovernment exhibits, and THREE copies of other documents you plan on submitting to the court.\u201d \n(Emphasis in original.) As noted above, Applicant responded to this email on December 13, 2018, and \nacknowledged receipt. I have marked the December 12 and 13, 2018 communications as HE IV. Applicant \nfailed to comply with the advisories in both communications, which he had acknowledged as having \nreceived. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old software engineer. Since August 2014, he has worked \nfor his security clearance sponsor, a major defense contractor. He worked for the same \ncompany as a software intern in 2013 to 2014 while pursuing his undergraduate degree. \nHe submitted his application for a clearance (SCA) on March 24, 2015. The SCA is his \nfirst application for a security clearance. His background interview occurred on July 6, \n2017.3 \n \n \nApplicant was born in Taiwan and immigrated to the United States with his parents \nin March 1996 at the age of 14. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 2001, \nwhen he was 19 years old. He earned a high school diploma in 2000. Ten years later, he \nbegan studying for an associate\u2019s degree and then a bachelor\u2019s degree at U.S. \neducational institutions. He received his associate\u2019s degree in June 2011 and his \nbachelor\u2019s in June 2014, when he was 32 years old. He is presently pursuing a master\u2019s \ndegree in engineering at an elite U.S. university. (Tr. 6-7, 25, and 29.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a dual U.S. and Taiwan citizen. She resides in the United \nStates and returns to Taiwan for medical treatment once or twice a year for a total of \nabout two or three weeks. She is mentally and physically disabled. She worked in a \nrestaurant in the United States from 2000 to 2006 until she became disabled. She owns \nrental properties and supports herself on the rental income produced by the properties. \nApplicant talks with his mother a few times a year. Prior to 1996, Applicant\u2019s mother was \na housewife in Taiwan. Applicant has limited contact with his mother. (Tr. 22-28.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and mother are divorced. After relocating to the United States in \n1996 with Applicant and his mother, his father moved back to Taiwan because he did not \nlike living in the United States. During the period 1997 to 2000, his father visited Applicant \nand his mother about two to three weeks each year. Applicant testified that his father was \na helicopter pilot in Taiwan providing disaster relief and that he is now elderly and retired. \nApplicant assumes without knowing for sure that his father worked for a Taiwanese \ngovernment agency.4 In his background interview, Applicant described his father\u2019s \noccupation as \u201ca retired policeman.\u201d (Tr. 28-41; GE 2 at 7.) \n \n \nAfter 2000, Applicant had a more distant relationship with his father, who \nsubsequently divorced Applicant\u2019s mother and remarried a woman in Taiwan. Applicant \n                                                          \n2 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application, dated March 24, \n2015, (GE 1), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n \n3 The record does not reveal the reason for the delay of more than two years between the submission of \nthe SCA and his interview. Applicant confirmed the accuracy of the investigator\u2019s report of the interview in \nresponse to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories, dated May 21, 2018. (GE 2 at 11.) \n \n4 Applicant was given the opportunity to confirm his assumption or otherwise change his testimony by \nJanuary 17, 2019. (Tr. 31-32.) As noted above, he failed to provide any further information after the \nconclusion of the hearing.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \ntestified, however, that his father did provide financial support for Applicant while he was \nattending college. They had frequent contact during that period. He testified that since he \ngraduated in 2014, Applicant only exchanges text messages with his father on holidays. \nHe last spoke with his father in February 2018 when Applicant\u2019s wife had a baby. \nApplicant testified that because his father was elderly, his father does not communicate \nby phone often. In his 2015 SCA, however, he wrote that he spoke with his father by \nphone on a weekly basis. In his July 2017 background interview, he stated that he had \nmonthly contacts with his father by phone and last saw him in May 2017 when Applicant \nvisited Taiwan. His father also had two children from his first marriage. They are citizens \nand residents of Taiwan. Applicant has no contact with his half-brother and half-sister. \n(Tr. 28-41; GE 2 at 7.) \n \n \nApplicant married a Taiwanese woman in January 2011, and the couple divorced \nin January 2012. In his background interview, he reported that he sponsored this woman \nfor legal residency in the United States and that he believes they were introduced so that \nhe would marry her, which would permit her to remain in the United States legally because \nshe only had a \u201cvisa,\u201d presumably a tourist visa. On his March 2015 SCA, he failed to \ndisclose his sponsorship of his first wife in response to a question about any sponsorship \nof a foreign national in Section 20B of the SCA. He testified that this omission was due to \nhis misunderstanding of the \u201cdefinition of sponsor.\u201d According to his SCA, he moved out \nof a residence in July 2011 that he had owned and lived in since May 2010. For \nunexplained reasons, he transferred this residence to his wife as part of their divorce after \nonly one year of marriage, and, it appears, after only cohabiting with her as a married \ncouple from January 2011 to July 2011. They had no children. (GE 2 at 6; Tr. 42, 45-48, \nand 50.) \n \n \nAccording to his March 2015 SCA, Applicant lived in rental properties from July \n2011 until 2015. He testified at the hearing that he purchased a condominium sometime \nin 2015 and that this is his current residence. In his background interview, he reported \nthat he purchased this residence in June 2015, which was shortly after the date of the \nSCA, and that he rented a room to a Chinese student attending a U.S. university from \nJune 2015 until late 2017 or early 2018. The roommate moved out of Applicant\u2019s \nresidence when Applicant\u2019s second wife was about to deliver their child. The SOR alleges \nthis foreign contact as a security concern under Guideline B in \u00b6 1.d and alleges under \nGuideline E in \u00b6 2.d Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his contact with this person in his SCA. \nThe record is undeveloped whether Applicant knew this person when he submitted his \nSCA in March 2015 and whether he kept in contact with him after he moved out. (GE 2 \nat 6; Tr. 42, 45-48, and 50.) \n \n \nAlthough the record is not completely clear, Applicant\u2019s new wife appears to be the \nwoman he described as his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d in his July 2017 background interview. According \nto his January 2019 testimony, they met in late 2016 or early 2017 and have \u201cbeen \nmarried for about two years or so,\u201d i.e., in early 2017. If accurate, they were married prior \nto his interview and Applicant did not disclose his remarriage. The couple had a child in \nFebruary 2018, six or seven months after the interview. In his interview, he described his \n\n \n5 \n \n\u201cgirlfriend\u201d as a Chinese citizen, who worked as a civil engineer in the United States and \nwas a legal resident.5 (GE 2 at 6; Tr. 42, 45-50.)  \n \n \nIn his July 2017 background interview, Applicant reported that he maintained \ncontact with a former girlfriend, who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. They broke up in \nApril 2017, but continued their friendship and \u201cvideo chatting.\" He reported that they \nstarted dating in 2015. At the hearing, he testified that they started dating about three and \none-half years prior to the hearing date, which would be after the date of his March 2015 \nSCA. He then testified confusingly that he did not \u201chave a good reason for\u201d omitting this \nforeign contact in his SCA. He speculated that the relationship \u201cmust just have slipped \n[his] mind.\u201d In his background interview, he only mentioned one former girlfriend from a \nforeign country with whom he had a relationship between 2015 and April 2017. He also \ntestified, however, that he began dating this ex-girlfriend in late 2013 and the relationship \nended in November 2014. The timing suggests that either he was confused or there were \ntwo former girlfriends, one from 2013 to 2014 and a second from 2015 to 2017. In either \nevent, he omitted at least one ex-girlfriend as a foreign contact in his SCA. (Tr. 42-43 and \n49; GE 2 at 7.)  \n \n \nIn his July 2017 background interview, Applicant listed 11 other foreign contacts \nwith whom he had or continues to have close and/or continuing contact, but did not report \non his SCA. He testified that he misunderstood the question. These contacts are all \nTaiwanese and Chinese citizens. Some reside in their home country and some reside in \nthe United States. He also reported multiple trips to Taiwan (June 2014, May 2015, and \nMay 2017) and China (June 2014, June 2016, August 2016, and July 2017). In his March \n2015 SCA, he reported travel to Taiwan in 2012, but failed to disclose his June 2014 trip \nto Taiwan and China. At the hearing, he offered no explanation for his repeated trips to \nTaiwan and China during the 2012 to 2017 period, although, as noted above, he did report \nin his interview that he visited his father in Taiwan in May 2017. (GE 2 at 7-8.) \n \n \nIn his background interview, Applicant reported that he has twice been offered jobs \nto work at the Central Intelligence Agency, but turned down these offers in favor of other \njobs. He reported further that he had a pending application with that agency at the time \nof the interview. (GE 2 at 7-8.) \n \n \nApplicant worked in the banking industry before he began his undergraduate \nstudies in 2010. From 2005 to 2008, he worked at a bank as a \u201cPersonal Banker,\u201d as \nopposed to a teller. At that bank, he concentrated his efforts in the areas of home equity \nlines of credit, business loans, and mortgage lending. He testified that he was not involved \n                                                          \n5 Subparagraph 1.e of the SOR alleges that Applicant has several close friends who are citizens and \nresidents of Taiwan or China. Subparagraph 2.d alleges that he falsified information in response to Section \n19 of his SCA by not disclosing these Taiwanese or Chinese friends. The SOR did not specifically allege \nthat this woman was a foreign contact of Applicant. In his July 2017 background interview, he reported that \nhe started texting her in May 2016. If that is the month in which he met her, then he would have not been \nobligated to identify her as a foreign contact in his March 2015 SCA.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nwith opening new accounts and did not need to do so to meet his requirements.6 His \nbranch manager had monthly or quarterly quotas to meet for opening of new accounts. \nAs the end of the month or quarter would approach and the manager determined that his \nbranch was not meeting its quota, the manager would encourage his bankers, including \nApplicant, to open \u201cshell\u201d accounts to increase the branch\u2019s numbers. Shell accounts \nwere not real bank accounts and were opened with only a few dollars provided by the \nbanker or the manager, and they were subsequently closed. At the hearing, Applicant \nadmitted opening shell accounts for his family members. He also admitted this conduct \nwas unethical, and when asked why he engaged in this unethical conduct, his response \nwas \u201cbecause everyone was doing it.\u201d (Tr. 53-65; GE 2 at 5.) \n \n \nIn 2008, Applicant\u2019s employer fired him. According to his background interview, \nthis happened in November 2008. In his SCA, he wrote that his employment ended in \nFebruary 2008. Applicant failed to disclose on his SCA that he had been fired. In response \nto the question in the application regarding his reason for leaving that job, Applicant \nresponded \u201cMoved.\u201d (GE 2 at 5.) \n \n \nIn his background interview, he reported that he was not sure what happened and \ndid not believe the bank. He also said that his friends told him it did not matter what he \nwrote on his \u201csecurity forms\u201d because he could explain what happened latter. It is not \nclear from the investigator\u2019s report of the interview whether he volunteered that he was \nfired or was confronted by the interviewer with this fact. He testified, however, that he \nlearned he had been fired from the investigator and tried to get more information from the \ninvestigator about his termination. He admitted in his SOR Response that he was in fact \nfired from that position. (Tr. at 61; GE 2 at 5-6.) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant resisted admitting that he knew he had been fired, \nclaiming he was confused by what happened and was never told why he was fired. He \ntestified that when he was terminated, the employer\u2019s representative used the words: \u201cWe \nhave to let you go.\u201d He testified further that he was told by his employer that his actions \nwere not the bank\u2019s \u201cways.\u201d He refused to admit that he lost his job because he opened \n\u201cshell accounts.\u201d He was walked out of the bank that day in 2008, though he testified that \nhe was never told he was fired.7 (Tr. 53-66.) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant tried to explain the discrepancy between the false \nstatement in his SCA and his testimony by stating that at the time he prepared the SCA, \nhe did not know that he was fired. Applicant testified at length that he was \u201cthe top one \npercent banker\u201d at his bank. He admitted that he did not leave this job voluntarily. He \n                                                          \n6 Tr. 58. In his background interview, he told the investigator that his job at the bank was to open new \naccounts and loans. (GE 2 at 5.) \n \n7 Curiously, he told the background investigator a completely different story regarding the reason he was \nfired. He reported that he was falsely accused of leaving a customer loan document in an empty office on \nanother floor of the bank. He also testified that the alternative questions in Section 13C about quitting after \nbeing told that he would be fired or left a job by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of \nmisconduct applied to his situation. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 64.) \n\n \n7 \n \nclaimed that since he was subsequently hired by another bank, he did not think that there \nwas any reference to being fired in his record. (Tr. 53-66.) \n \nTaiwan \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts regarding Taiwan and \nChina. Taiwan is a multi-party democracy, established as a separate, independent \ngovernment by refugees from mainland China in 1949. The United States recognized \nTaiwan as an independent government until January 1979, when it formally recognized \nthe Chinese government as the sole legal government of all of China, including Taiwan. \nThis has been referred to as the U.S. \u201cOne-China\u201d policy. Nevertheless, the United States \nand Taiwan enjoy a positive, unofficial relationship.  \n \nChinese actors are the world\u2019s most active perpetrators of economic espionage. \nChina aggressively targets sensitive and protected U.S. technologies and military \ninformation, using worldwide intelligence operations, including Chinese intelligence \noperatives based in Taiwan. The United States faces a serious threat to its national \nsecurity from Chinese intelligence collection operations. China uses it intelligence \nservices and employs other illicit approaches that violate U.S. laws and export controls to \nobtain important export-restricted technologies and equipment. China\u2019s collection \nactivities include the use of Chinese nationals, such as students and researchers to act \nas procurement agents or intermediaries. \n \nTaiwan has a strong economy and maintains significant economic contacts with \nChina. For many years, Taiwan has also been an active collector of U.S. economic \nintelligence and technology, including dual-use technologies that have sensitive military \napplications. There have been numerous cases involving illegal export or attempted \nexport of sensitive, dual-use technology to Taiwan. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR sets forth five allegations under Guideline B regarding Applicant\u2019s \nmother, father, a former girlfriend, a roommate, and a number of close friends, all of whom  \nare citizens and in some cases residents of Taiwan or China. The security concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6, as follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \n\n \n9 \n \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence has established that Applicant\u2019s contacts with his \nfather create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion. Also, his relationship with his father constitutes a connection to a \nforeign person that creates a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and Applicant\u2019s desire to help \nhis father. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. With respect to Applicant\u2019s mother, his former \ngirlfriend, his former roommate, and his Taiwanese and Chinese friends, the record \nevidence does not establish either AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) or 7(b).  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n\n \n10 \n \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s relationship with his father is significant \neven though Applicant attempted to minimize the closeness of his connection with his \nfather. Applicant\u2019s testimony was inconsistent on this point. He also provided inconsistent \nevidence about his father\u2019s occupation before he retired, which raises questions as to \nwhether Applicant was seeking to obscure the truth. He was given an opportunity to clarify \nwhether his father worked for the Taiwanese government, and he never followed up after \nthe hearing.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant has lived his entire adult life in the United \nStates. He was educated here and he is presently continuing his education at a U.S. \nuniversity. He owns his residence in this country, and he and his family live here. Even \nthough he is not presently close to his mother, she lives most of the year in the United \nStates as a dual citizen of the U.S. and Taiwan. He has deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. His father provided financial support to Applicant \nduring his college years (2010-2014). Applicant was in frequent contact with him for years \nafter he graduated, and he visited his father in May 2017. The inconsistencies in \nApplicant\u2019s evidence regarding his relationship with his father and my general concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s credibility on security significant issues, as discussed below in my \nanalysis of the Guideline E issues, undercut the persuasiveness of Applicant\u2019s evidence \nin mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(c) with respect to his father.  \n \n \nI conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b with respect to his father.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nThe following disqualifying condition under Guideline E is potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence support the conclusion that \nAppellant was terminated by the bank in 2008 and that he acted unethically by opening \n\u201cshell accounts,\u201d as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. The evidence, however, does not \nsufficiently establish the bank\u2019s reason for terminating him, though one could assume that \nit was related to the shell accounts. Rather than make an assumption, I conclude that the \nevidence does not establish that Applicant\u2019s termination by the bank raises a security \nconcern. I, therefore, conclude that AG \u00b6 16(c) is not established with respect to SOR \u00b6 \n2.a. If Applicant was terminated by the bank because he opened shell accounts, then the \ntermination is encompassed by the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b. I do conclude, however, that \nApplicant opened shell accounts while working at the bank and that this conduct was \nunethical. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 16(c) is established with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.b.  \n \nIn addition, Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence support the conclusion \nthat he deliberately falsified information in his March 2015 SCA with respect to the reason \nhe left his employment with the bank in 2008, his failure to disclose his foreign contacts, \nand his failure to disclose his sponsorship of his first wife for permanent residency, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.d, and 2.e. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established with respect to those \nallegations.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony is replete with inconsistencies and blatantly false \nstatements. No issue demonstrates this better than Applicant\u2019s efforts to make his \ntermination from the bank sound, at best, unfair, or at least, for uncertain reasons. He \nalternatively denied being fired and admitted he was walked out of the bank for not \ncomplying with the \u201cbank\u2019s ways.\u201d I found his testimony on every security-significant issue \nto lack candor. Applicant\u2019s demeanor, as well as his style of speaking, was that of \nsomeone trying to sell a false story. He would provide lengthy responses to simple \nquestions rather than just admit the truth. I could give credit to little of his testimony as \nbeing truthful. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(b): the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment \nwas caused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nNone of these mitigating conditions apply. Applicant testified that he did not know \nhe had been fired from the bank until the background investigator told him so. That \ntestimony bars a possible conclusion that he volunteered this information at his interview. \nIn his SOR Response, he denied opening shell accounts when he worked at the bank, \nthough he eventually admitted at the hearing that he did so using the excuse that \neveryone did it. He falsely claimed that he did not understand the questions in the SCA \nthat required him to disclose information that he had to know was of potential security \nsignificance regarding his close foreign contacts and his sponsorship of his first wife for \npermanent residency in the United States. On the sponsorship falsification, he claimed \nunconvincingly at the hearing that at the time he submitted his SCA, he did not know the \nmeaning of the word \u201csponsor.\u201d Under the facts presented by Applicant, AG \u00b6 17(a) is not \nestablished. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(b) is not established with respect his falsification about his termination by \nthe bank by Applicant\u2019s statement to the investigator that his friends told him that it did \nnot matter what he wrote on his security forms. There is no evidence that his friends were \nattorneys or persons with professional responsibilities relating to security processes. \nMoreover, it is unlikely that this statement was true since Applicant did not repeat this \nexcuse at the hearing. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established because Applicant\u2019s misconduct was not minor or \ninfrequent. Even though the bank misconduct that lead to his termination and the opening \nof shell accounts, if that was not the reason for the termination, occurred a number of \nyears ago, his falsification about his termination in his SCA is recent. Moreover, all of his \nmisconduct is part of a long pattern of unreliable and dishonest behavior, which casts \nserious doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \n\n \nWhole-Person Concept \n13 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).8  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under these guidelines \nand evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his foreign contact and connection with \nhis father and by his personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns about her suitability to hold a security clearance, which relate to \nacademic sanctions during college for plagiarism, various false claims in her personal \nlife, and multiple falsifications on a security clearance application. Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCA) in September 2015 \nand May 2017, in connection with her employment in the defense industry. On May 4, \n2018, following a background investigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct. The DOD CAF took \nthis action under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n02/06/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \namended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 4, 2018, and requested a determination on \nthe administrative (written) record, in lieu of a hearing. On July 10, 2018, Department \nCounsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 5, and provided a copy to Applicant. She was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on July 18, 2018. Her FORM Response is \ndated the same day. She did not object to the Government\u2019s evidence.1 The SOR and \nthe Answer (Items 1 and 2) are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 5 are \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The Government did not object to Applicant\u2019s \nFORM Response, and it is also admitted. The case was assigned to me on September \n13, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nIn her answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.i), with a \nlengthy narrative statement. Her admissions and statements are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the evidence \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 28 years old. She has never married, and has no children. She \ngraduated from high school in 2008. She attended community college from August 2008 \nto December 2011, earning an associate\u2019s degree. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nMay 2016. (Item 5 at 8-10) \n \nAt the time Applicant submitted her SCAs, she was employed in the clerk\u2019s office \nof a county court system. By the time she received the SOR, she was employed by her \nclearance sponsor,2 though it is not clear how long she has worked there. The evidence \nindicates that she works as a background investigator.3  \n \nFrom April 2012 to January 2013, Applicant worked as an assistant in a \nlaboratory. She performed clerical duties such as labelling, logging in lab samples, and \ndocumenting chain of custody information. She was counseled and retrained after she \nmade mistakes. Her performance improved, but after a period of time she \u201cgot \ncomfortable\u201d and started making the same mistakes. As a result, she was terminated in \nJanuary 2013. The termination is not alleged in the SOR, but she failed to disclose \neither the job or the termination on her 2015 SCA, as noted below. \n                                                          \n1 In her FORM Response, Applicant objected to certain arguments made by Department Counsel in the \nGovernment\u2019s FORM. I do not read her comments as constituting \u201cobjections\u201d to the admissibility of any \nof the Government\u2019s proposed evidence. Applicant also clarified certain statements in her background \ninterview.  \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s work e-mail address, which she provided on her SOR receipt, names her clearance sponsor.  \n \n3 Item 2 at 4; Item 4 (p. 8 of July 2017 interview summary) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn 2012, while in college, Applicant plagiarized a term paper, half of which she \nlifted from a Wikipedia web page without citing to it. When her actions came to light, she \nhad a telephonic hearing before the university\u2019s honor council and admitted what she \ndid. She received an \u201cF\u201d in the class and was placed on academic probation until \nDecember 2013. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \n  \nIn December 2013, while taking an online class as a senior, Applicant plagiarized \nanother assignment, again due to insufficient source citations. This led to another honor \ncouncil hearing, which she did not attend. In about February 2014, shortly before she \nwas to graduate, Applicant was notified by letter that she received an \u201cF\u201d in the class, \nand that she was suspended from the university until fall 2015. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) She went to \nthe graduation ceremony in February 2014, but was not awarded a diploma at the time. \n(Item 5 at 10) \n \nApplicant submitted her first SCA in September 2015. (Item 3) When asked if she \nreceived a degree or diploma, she answered, \u201cYes,\u201d and also falsely stated that she \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in January 2014. (Item 3 at 10) (SOR \u00b6 1.g) In detailing \nher employment, Applicant failed to disclose either her job at the laboratory, or the fact \nthat she had been terminated from the position. (Item 3 at 10-13) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i)  \n \nApplicant had a background interview in September 2015, ten days after she \nsubmitted her SCA. In discussing her education, she was asked if she received a \ndegree or diploma. She said she did not. When asked why she answered \u201cYes\u201d to that \nquestion on her SCA, she said she \u201cmeant to put no.\u201d She was then asked why, if that \nwas what she meant, she also reported receiving a specific degree on a specific date. \nApplicant then said she was not aware until the interview that the investigating agent \nwould go to the college registrar\u2019s office to verify her academic credentials.4  \n \nWhen Applicant was asked for further details, she reported learning from the \nuniversity shortly before graduation (in February 2014) that she had been suspended \ndue to an allegation of plagiarism, and that the university would not be awarding her a \ndegree. Applicant said she attended the graduation ceremony anyway, and did not \ninform her family that she had been suspended. Applicant denied in her September \n2015 background interview that she had committed plagiarism.5 \n \nApplicant had a second background interview in November 2015. She began the \ninterview by detailing (and for the first time, acknowledging) her plagiarism during her \nsenior year in college. She denied any other incidents of plagiarism. Applicant was then \nconfronted with evidence of her earlier act of plagiarism, in 2012. When asked why she \ndid not disclose it, she said she thought the initial interviewing agent would find out \nabout it; she had never told anyone about it; and she was reluctant to discuss it in either \nof her background interviews. She said that no one knew about that incident, or that she \ndid not earn a degree. She did not tell her parents because they already had a strained \n                                                          \n4 Item 4 (p. 2 of September 2015 interview) \n \n5 Item 4 (p. 2-3 of September 2015 interview) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nrelationship due to strong cultural differences, and she had to struggle to get her \nparents to allow her to attend college outside the home.6 Applicant said her intention \nwas to continue letting people think she had earned a college degree, because it was \neasier to do that than to tell everyone the truth.7 \n \nUnder questioning from the investigator, Applicant then disclosed her \nemployment at the laboratory, and the fact that she had been terminated. She said she \ndid not want to disclose that information because she did not want the investigators to \nknow about it, and because she thought it would be used against her and cause her to \nbe denied a clearance.8 \n \nSOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d all concern false information Applicant publicized \nabout herself, either through online social media or otherwise to her friends, in an \nattempt to present or create an \u201calternate life,\u201d and thus to lead people to believe her life \nwas more interesting and exciting than it was. Though she admitted the allegations, the \nrecord evidence does not contain the social media excerpts themselves. \n \nIn about March 2013, Applicant went to watch a visiting professional hockey \nteam practice at a local ice rink. While there, she had her picture taken with one of the \nvisiting team\u2019s players. She then posted the picture online, and said the player was her \n\u201cboyfriend.\u201d She also allowed her friends to think that they were \u201cdating\u201d and that she \nwent to Canada to visit him. In fact, she met the player only once, on that occasion. She \nnever corrected her friends when they made assumptions about their \u201crelationship,\u201d \nnone of which were true. (SOR \u00b6 1.c)  \n \nIn 2014, Applicant \u201cfollowed\u201d a U.S. Olympic athlete online, and read the athlete\u2019s \nonline reports about the athlete\u2019s experiences at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, \nRussia. Applicant also posted some of the athlete\u2019s photos on her own social media \naccounts, passing them off as her own. Applicant also told friends that she went to the \nOlympics herself, and stayed at the Olympic Village. None of this was true. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b)9 \n \nApplicant indicated in her Answer that she discontinued her initial clearance \ninvestigation and sought to \u201cget myself and my life in order before trying again.\u201d (Answer \nat 4) She submitted a second SCA in May 2017. (Item 4) \n                                                          \n6 Item 4 (pp. 1-2 of November 2015 interview). \n \n7 Item 4 (p. 2 of November 2015 interview).This incident is not specifically alleged in the SOR. Thus, I will \nnot consider it as disqualifying conduct.  \n \n8 Item 4 (p. 3 of November 2015 interview). \n \n9 These embellishments came to light during Applicant\u2019s November 2015 background interview, when she \nwas asked to explain apparent foreign contacts (the \u201cboyfriend\u201d in Canada) and apparent foreign travel (to \nCanada and Russia) that she did not report on her SCA (because, as she explained, they were fictitious). \n(Item 4 at pp. 3-4 of November 2015 interview). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nIn detailing her education on her second SCA, Applicant stated that she was \nplaced on academic probation for plagiarism in 2011 [actually, 2012]; was suspended in \nJanuary 2013 for improper source citation; \u201cwalked at graduation before [the] decision \nwas made;\u201d was allowed to reenroll in fall 2015, retook a course, got an \u201cA\u201d and \ngraduated in May 2016 with a bachelor\u2019s degree. She said she \u201cnever disclosed my \nsuspension to anyone.\u201d (Item 5 at 10) She also disclosed her job at the lab, and the fact \nthat she was fired in 2013 for \u201cclerical errors when processing chain of custody \nsamples.\u201d She also disclosed her earlier warning about her performance in that job. \n(Item 5 at 14-16) She discussed and confirmed her information in a July 2017 \nbackground interview, which did not reveal any additional discrepancies. (Item 4) \n \nApplicant explained that she lied to her friends about her life and posted false \ninformation on social media as a form of escapism. She said she was struggling to \nbreak free from, and rebel against, her conservative upbringing at home, particularly her \noverbearing father. She was also trying to find a job and dealing with her mother\u2019s \nillness and her father\u2019s loss of employment, which led to increased stress at home. \n(Answer; FORM Response) \n \nApplicant accepted responsibility for her acts of plagiarism in college, and for her \nfalsifications on her 2015 SCA. She acknowledged making several \u201chuge\u201d errors in \njudgment, both in how she filled out her SCA, and in how she held herself out to others. \nShe said she \u201cleft out these details out of fear and embarrassment that I wouldn\u2019t get a \nclearance and just pure ignorance of how the investigation process worked. I thought \nmy security form was like a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and it needed to look good.\u201d (Answer)  \n \nApplicant asserted in her Answer and her FORM Response that she has \nmatured, and now has a greater understanding of the need for honesty and candor. She \nsaid she has significantly curtailed her social media activity. She said her relationship \nwith her father has improved. She said she loves her job as a background investigator, \nand strives to work with the greatest integrity. She asserts that she has \u201cnever once \nfalsified any reports [or] mishandled sensitive information,\u201d and now knows when and \nhow to ask for help from her supervisor. She believes she has made the necessary \nchanges to show that she is more reliable and responsible, and is worthy of being \ngranted a clearance. (Answer; FORM Response) \n \n \nApplicant did not indicate that she has been through any form of psychological \ncounseling or therapy to help her change or understand her prior behavior. She also did \nnot indicate that she has told her family about any of her academic misconduct or the \nresulting sanctions she received from the university. While Applicant asserts that she \nhas curtailed her social media activity, she did not indicate that she has corrected or \ndeleted any of the false information on her social media accounts, or that she has \nactively sought to disabuse her friends from their prior false perceptions about her life, \nbe it her hockey player \u201cboyfriend,\u201d her \u201ctrip to the Olympics,\u201d or other online falsehoods \nand embellishments that she previously publicized and allowed people to believe.  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d10 \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n                                                          \n10 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that \nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information;   \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . \n \n                     (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant has a troubling history of falsifications and of publicizing false \ninformation about herself in her personal and professional life, online and otherwise. \nShe committed plagiarism during college in 2012, leading to an honor code violation, a \nfailing grade, and placement on academic probation. She committed plagiarism again in \nDecember 2013, shortly after her probation term ended. She was suspended from \nschool for two years and prevented from graduating in February 2014. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and \n1.f satisfy AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(3), as well as the \u201cgeneral concern\u201d in AG \u00b6 15.  \n \n \nApplicant also did not disclose her academic problems to her parents, nor did \nshe disclose to them that she had been suspended from school, and therefore did not \ngraduate in February 2014 (even though she attended and participated in the \ngraduation ceremony). She acknowledged that she kept that information from them out \nof shame, embarrassment, and out of fear of how they would react. AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) \ntherefore applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant prepared her first SCA, in September 2015, she falsely reported \nthat she had earned a degree in February 2014. She also failed to report one of her \njobs, and the fact that she was terminated from the position. These falsifications, \nalleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i, all of which Applicant admitted, satisfy AG \u00b6 16(a).  \n \n \nThe remaining allegations concern false information Applicant publicized about \nherself, online and otherwise, in an attempt to create an \u201calternate life\u201d for herself, or at \nleast to make her life appear more interesting and exciting, during 2013 and 2014. She \nposted an online picture of herself with a professional hockey player, and wrote online \nthat he was her \u201cboyfriend.\u201d She allowed her friends to believe she went to Canada to \nvisit him. Applicant also posted pictures of a U.S. Olympic athlete online, posted \ninformation falsely implying that the athlete\u2019s pictures were hers, and falsely wrote that \nshe went to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia, and stayed at the Olympic Village.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c satisfy AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(3). They also satisfy AG \n\u00b6 16(e)(1), since Applicant falsely publicized information about herself precisely \nbecause she wanted to improve her personal or community standing. If that is true, the \npossible disclosure that the information she posted is false potentially increased her \nvulnerability to exploitation. AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) therefore applies.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c are specific examples of Applicant\u2019s untruthful conduct, \ngenerally described in SOR \u00b6 1.d (presenting an \u201calternate life\u201d on social media by \nposting fabricated stories and photographs). SOR \u00b6 1.d is therefore duplicative, and is \nfound for Applicant on that basis.11  \n                                                          \n11 When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative \nallegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2005) (same debt alleged twice).  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E:   \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant provided deliberately false information about her academic record on \nher 2015 SCA. When asked during her first background interview if she received a \ndegree or diploma, she said she did not. When asked why she answered \u201cYes\u201d to that \nquestion on her SCA, she said she \u201cmeant to put no.\u201d She was then asked why, if that \nwas what she meant, she also reported receiving a specific degree on a specific date. \nApplicant then said she was not aware until the interview that the investigating agent \nwould go to the college registrar\u2019s office to verify her academic credentials.  \n \n \nOnly then, having been caught in a lie, did Applicant explain why she did not \nhave a bachelor\u2019s degree, as she had claimed. Even then, she did not acknowledge \n(until her second interview) that she committed plagiarism during the senior year \nseminar, nor did she disclose her earlier plagiarism violation from 2012, or her \nplacement on academic probation. She did not disclose the earlier plagiarism until she \nwas confronted about it, during her second interview. She did not disclose her job at the \nlab, or her termination from the position, until her second interview, either.  \n \n \nApplicant did report her academic issues, and the termination, more truthfully on \nher 2017 SCA. However, by that time, she had no choice, since the information had \nalready come out in her earlier interviews. While her late candor has some mitigating \neffect, it is not dispositive. Applicant\u2019s prior falsifications, which are multiple, are not fully \nmitigated by her subsequent admissions and disclosures.12 Additionally, the acts of \nmisconduct themselves have independent security significance, and are not mitigated \nby their eventual disclosure to the Government.13 It is also not mitigating that Applicant \n                                                          \n12 ISCR Case No. 15-08246 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 16, 2017).  \n \n13 ISCR Case No. 98-0223 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 1998) (\u201cHonesty and candor with the government do \nnot immunize admitted misconduct from being considered for its security significance.\u201d)  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nfailed to disclose her misconduct because she was embarrassed, did not want to \ndiscuss it with the interviewers, or because she thought she would not be granted a \nclearance if the information came to light. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant has a significant track record of creating and publicizing false \ninformation about herself. Through embellishment and active creation of falsehoods, \nboth online and otherwise, she allowed people to believe information about herself that \nshe knew not to be true. More seriously, she committed plagiarism not once but twice \nduring college, including as a senior, after she was caught the first time and placed on \nacademic probation. She then lied about that information (and about a job termination) \nto the U.S. Government, on her initial SCA. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant has admitted her behavior, accepted responsibility for her actions, and \nacknowledged a serious error in judgment. She attributes her actions to a desire to \nescape a suffocating home life and an overbearing father. She says her personal qualify \nof life has improved, as has her relationship with him. But she does not really explain \nwhy this is so. Nor did she provide any independent evidence that she has undertaken \ncounseling to change her behavior, or has \u201ctaken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances or factors that contributed\u201d to her prior untrustworthy and \nunreliable behavior. In particular, it is noteworthy that all of her assertions in this \nregard are uncorroborated. She did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that \nAG \u00b6 17(d) should apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s embellishments and falsehoods in her personal life and online are \nseveral years old. So are the instances of plagiarism. The false information she \npublicized about herself (the \u201cCanadian boyfriend\u201d and the \u201ctrips to Canada and \nRussia\u201d) were easily disproven by good, even simple, detective work by the \ninvestigating agent. Once confronted, she owned up to it. However, while she says she \nhas curtailed her social media activity, she did not state that she altered or corrected the \ninformation online, nor did she state that she has actively sought to disabuse her friends \nfrom their prior false perceptions about her life. She has also not indicated that she has \ntold her parents anything about her academic troubles, including that she did not \ngraduate from college in 2014. Applicant gets some credit in mitigation because she \ndisclosed this information to the government. However, given the nature and pattern of \nthe allegations, she has not provided sufficient information to establish that AG \u00b6 17(e) \nshould fully apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n11 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered the total pattern \nof Applicant\u2019s behavior and poor judgment, not just in a piecemeal fashion as a series of \nunrelated incidents.14  Since Applicant requested an administrative determination in lieu \nof a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her demeanor or to weigh her credibility. \nHer statements are also uncorroborated by any supporting evidence. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e - 1.i:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, presented by the record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M.

DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on April 5, 2019. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations. Her admissions are \nincorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She began working \nat her present job in approximately March 2018. From January 2016 to March 2018, she \nwas a shift supervisor for corporate security. She is single, never married, and has no \nchildren. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009.1 \nThe SOR alleged Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in July 2015 and \nthat the dischargeable debts were discharged in November 2015. The SOR also alleged \nfour charged-off student loans totaling approximately $135,516. The allegations are \nsupported by court documents showing the 2015 bankruptcy and credit reports from \nNovember 2017, April 2018, and March 2019 showing the delinquent student loans. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e).2 \nApplicant credibly explained that when she graduated from college in 2009 she \nhad accumulated approximately $80,000 worth of student loans paying for her \neducation. For some period after her graduation she was unemployed and \nunderemployed because of the poor economy. Her loans were deferred during this time, \nbut they were incurring interest charges at rates between 15% and 19%. When she \nfinally secured employment in her chosen field, her annual salary was approximately \n$42,000 and her student loan amounts had risen to approximately $160,000. She could \nnot afford to make the $2,000 monthly payments the credit holders were demanding. \nShe sought to consolidate the loans, but the creditor refused. She was willing to pay her \nstudent loans, but she was unable to do so.3 \nApplicant kept in contact with her student loan creditor, but she also sought \nadvice from an attorney. In 2015, she spoke with an attorney who advised her that she \nshould file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and include her student loans in the bankruptcy. \nApplicant reluctantly followed this advice and included her student loans in her \nbankruptcy. Her total liabilities listed in the petition were approximately $181,000 and of \nthat amount approximately $161,000 were from her student loans. She had never been \ndelinquent on her other debts listed in the bankruptcy before her attorney advised her to \n1 Tr. at 46-47, 19-21; GE 1; AE A. \n2 GE 3-6. \n3 Tr. at 21-22; Answer. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstop paying them so they could be included in the bankruptcy. Her petition was granted \nand her debts were discharged except for her student loans which were non\u00ad\ndischargeable in bankruptcy. Applicant was given incorrect advice by her attorney.4 \nApplicant sought assistance from a second attorney who began negotiating with \nthe student loan creditor in August 2017 about reaching a settlement. The creditor sued \nApplicant in state court, but those claims were all involuntarily dismissed by the judge in \nAugust, October, and December 2018. Despite these dismissals, Applicant had her \nattorney purse settlement negotiations with the creditor. The settlement terms were \nreached in March 2019 and include Applicant paying a total of $30,000 through four \npayments. Applicant documented that she completed her payments under the \nagreement. Applicant obtained these funds from her parents who recently won a $1 \nmillion lottery. All her student loans are now resolved. Her March 2019 credit report \nshows no other delinquent debt.5 \nBased upon Applicant\u2019s recent personal financial statement, her financial affairs \nare in good order showing a monthly surplus of approximately $1,468. She received \nfinancial counseling through her bankruptcy, and more recently, as advised by her \nsecond attorney. She also provided three character letters from two former coworkers \nand a personal friend. All attest to her honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness.6 \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n4 Tr. at 23-25, 27; Answer; AE D-E. \n5 Tr. at 27, 29-31, 34; Answer; AE E-I, N-P. \n6 Tr. at 34; 37, 39; AE B-C, J-M. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary  \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accumulated student loans that became delinquent. She also filed a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy in 2015. I find both the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant funded her college education using student loans. Upon graduation, \nshe was unemployed and underemployed. Her student loans accumulated large interest \ncharges during this time. Applicant finally obtained employment in her career field, but \nby then her student loans had doubled in amount. She could not afford the payment \nplan her creditor demanded. She filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on the advice of \ncounsel who told her that the student loans would be discharged. That was incorrect \nadvice. She continued to communicate with her creditor, through her new attorney, and \nreached a settlement agreement in March 2019. Her initial unemployment and \nunderemployment and the bad legal advice she received concerning the effect of a \nbankruptcy were conditions beyond her control and she acted responsibly by continuing \nto work out a settlement with her student loan creditor. She has received financial \ncounseling and her current financial picture shows that she has control over her \nfinances. She initiated a good-faith effort to settle her student loans and followed-up by \nmaking the negotiated payments. There are clear indications that her financial issues \nare being resolved and that recurrence is unlikely. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) - 20(d) are applicable.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \nI considered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor service, and the circumstances \nsurrounding her indebtedness. She has resolved her student loans and her current \nfinancial outlook is positive. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.   \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Items 2, 7) \n \n \nApplicant sought financial counseling in 2016, and she plans to consolidate \nmultiple payday loans she amassed following her driveway collapse and salary pay cut. \n(Item 5) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d Based on the information in the SOR, the record \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c), requiring \nadditional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \n AG \u00b6 20 lists five potential mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and her financial problems are not isolated. Her debt \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nis a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Nevertheless, she receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) \nbecause the debts occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur and her \nbehavior does not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.   \n \nApplication of AG \u00b6 20(b) is warranted. Applicant could not have predicted that \nher driveway would collapse or that she would incur a substantial pay cut in 2016. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are fully applicable. Applicant received financial counseling and her \ndebts are resolved. She heeded Department Counsel\u2019s concerns regarding her SOR \nanswer documentation shortcomings. Of note, she contacted all of her creditors and has \nregained financial responsibility.3 AG \u00b6 20(e) is not relevant. \n \n Whole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis section under \nGuideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further comments are \nwarranted. \nBoth the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and the whole-person analysis \nsupport a favorable decision. Applicant\u2019s Army service and employment with a defense \ncontractor weigh heavily in her favor. She is a law-abiding citizen and a productive \n                                                          \n3 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)).

Cervi, Administrative Judge \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 26, 2017. On \nApril 24, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) were \nrevised effective June 8, 2017, and apply herein. Applicant answered the SOR (Ans.) on \nMay 15, 2018, and requested a hearing. \n \nThe case was assigned to me on February 25, 2019. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 16, 2019, scheduling \n\n \n2 \n \nthe hearing for June 6, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant, his \nspouse, and a witness testified. Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-D were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. The record was held open to permit Applicant to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence in mitigation. AE E was submitted, which includes an email \nnarrative, tax returns, and other financial documents, and admitted in evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 17, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old pilot instructor, employed by a defense contractor since \n2017. From 2005 to 2013, Applicant worked as a retail salesman, a director of a youth \nclub, a fireplace technician, and as a rock climbing guide and yoga instructor. He next \noperated a lodge business with his current spouse from May 2013 until the business failed \nin February 2014. He was unemployed for about one month in 2014 while he requalified \nfor his pilot\u2019s license, then he worked as an airline pilot from 2014 to 2015, and as a \ncontract military instructor pilot from 2015 to 2017. (GE 1) Applicant twice filed Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy; first in 2000 that was discharged in 2001, and next in 2010 that was \ndischarged in 2011.  \n \nApplicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree from a U.S. military academy in 1986, and \nserved on active duty in the U.S. Air Force until he was honorably discharged in 1998. \n(Tr. 9) He was previously married in 1990 and divorced in 2001. He remarried in 2007, \nand has four adult children. Applicant held a security clearance while on active duty until \nhe was discharged in 1998 (Tr. 7). \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F, that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \n2010 that was discharged in 2011; failed to file Federal income tax returns for tax years \n2010 to 2016; is delinquent on unpaid state sales tax totaling about $2,000; and two \ndelinquent real-estate timeshare debts totaling over $15,800. Applicant admitted the \nbankruptcy, Federal income tax filing delinquency, and state sales tax allegations, and \ndenied the two timeshare debts. (Ans.) He noted in his answer to the SOR, that he was \nworking on the delinquent Federal tax returns, and that the state sales tax debt is paid. \n \nApplicant first filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2000 as a result of about $200,000 in \ndebt largely incurred in treating his first spouse\u2019s alcohol and drug problems, and mental \ninstability. He testified that her problems became apparent in 2000, and that her drug and \nalcohol abuse drove them into bankruptcy \u201cwith [his] permission at the time,\u201d because he \nwillingly used treatment centers that cost as much as $900 per day. He also developed \nhis own health issues causing him to resign his job and move to another state, but could \nnot find executive level employment. (Tr. 42-44) Applicant\u2019s second spouse worked and \ncohabitated with him beginning in 2003, and contributed to household income. However, \nApplicant claims that some credit card debts \u201cslipped through the cracks\u201d and were not \nlisted in his first bankruptcy filing. Applicant claims that creditors began pursuing about \n$13,000 in delinquent debt, interest and fees, seven years after his first bankruptcy. (Tr. \n46) A judgment was entered against Applicant in 2004 and a delinquent credit-card \n\n \n3 \n \naccount opened in 2002, well after his first bankruptcy. (Tr. 46-47) He filed his second \nChapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010, and discharged about $33,000 in liabilities in 2011. (GE 5) \nAppellant\u2019s spouse testified that they are in the process of exploring filing another \nbankruptcy (Tr. 29, 34). In Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, he provided evidence \nthat he and his spouse completed internet credit counseling mandated by the bankruptcy \ncourt on June 20, 2019, the day before the hearing in this case. (AE E) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e allege debts to a financial company on timeshare properties, \ntotaling about $15,818. In 2011, Applicant purchased an interest in two timeshare \nproperties, but refused to pay a debt incurred because he believed the seller operated in \nbad faith. (Tr. 48-51) Appellant\u2019s spouse disputed a debt to the credit bureaus, and \nreported the results were \u201cinconclusive.\u201d (Tr. 51) Applicant testified that he \u201cgave the \nproperty back.\u201d (Tr. 50) The debts were reported on Applicant\u2019s combined 2017 credit \nreport (GE 3), but do not appear on his August 2018 Equifax credit report (GE 4). In his \npost-hearing submission, Applicant provided a \u201cscreen shot\u201d from a free online credit \naccess company, suggesting a dispute filed against a known debt collection agency, and \na separate page showing a collection account for the timeshare debt in question. The \ndebt collection company dispute was apparently filed in 2016, and Applicant noted in \nhandwriting on the document, that no response was received on the dispute as of June \n21, 2019. (AE E) It is unclear whether the page showing the debt collection company \ndispute is related to the page showing the timeshare debt. The timeshare debt page only \nshows that the joint account was opened in 2014, and it was placed for collection. (AE E) \nOf note, Applicant\u2019s 2017 credit report does not show the timeshare debt being collected \nby the debt collection agency, or any other collection agency. (GE 3) Finally, no clear \ndocumentary evidence was presented showing the current status of the timeshare debts, \ncommunications with the creditor, or a final resolution of the debts was provided. \n \nApplicant did not file Federal income tax returns when due, for tax years 2010 to \n2016. During the hearing, he admitted that he also failed to file his 2017 or 2018 Federal \nincome tax returns when due. Although Applicant\u2019s spouse primarily handled tax return \npreparation for the family, Applicant knew that she was not filing returns. (Tr. 39) Applicant \ntestified that: \n \nAt the time it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s an old pilot deal. Here\u2019s everything that\u2019s on my plate \nto do, here\u2019s what I have the capacity to effect [sic] so I let the taxes go.\u201d \n(Tr. 56) Needless to say, I am not good at taxes and I intentionally delayed \nthem until I could reasonably get to them and until we had the resources to \nactually hire a new CPA to help us with it and found the right one. So I suck \nat taxes. (Tr. 63-64) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified that tax returns went unfiled, in part, as a result of a \nsexual assault of her by their tax accountant in 2008. She did not disclose the assault to \nApplicant until 2013 or 2014, nor did they report the assault to authorities, but they \ncontinued to use the same accountant for several years after the incident. (Tr. 36-37) Of \nnote, Applicant\u2019s spouse was also caring for her parents in around 2008, and was \nsuffering from her own illness which led to her employment termination in 2012 and a \n\n \n4 \n \ndiagnosis of a brain tumor in 2013. (Tr. 36-37) She has not worked since 2013, except \nfor their lodge business, purchased in March 2013 and ended in February 2014. The \nbusiness failure resulted in foreclosure of the lodge property and about $250,000 in \nlosses. (Tr. 29, 33; GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2010 Federal tax return in April 2015. His 2011 and 2012 Federal \ntax returns were completed and signed on June 4, 2019, two days before his hearing in \nthis case. (AE A and B) Federal tax returns for 2013-2018 were completed and signed on \nJune 21, 2019, the date the post-hearing submissions were due. The post-hearing \nsubmission included Federal e-filing authorizations for his 2017 and 2018 tax returns, also \ncompleted and signed on June 21, 2019. There is no documentary evidence showing the \n2013 to 2016 tax returns were submitted to the IRS. Of note, Applicant stated in his post-\nhearing email that: \u201c[a]ll documents are being sent certified mail or have already \nbeen e-filed.\u201d (emphasis added) (AE E) \n \n \nApplicant reported in his SCA and his interview with a Government investigator, \nthat he owed a state government $1,000 to $2,000 for unpaid sales tax. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) He \nnoted in his interview, that he received letters from the state tax authorities, but that he \ndid not have the money to pay the debt. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant \nprovided documentary evidence that two state tax liens from the state in question totaling \napproximately $1,616, were released on October 23, 2017. It is unclear from the evidence \nwhether the two satisfied liens are related to the state sales tax debt. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s colleague testified in support of Applicant\u2019s honesty and \ntrustworthiness. They have worked together as pilots on government contracts since \n2015. In addition, Applicant submitted a letter of support from his current site manager, \nwho attested to Applicant\u2019s work ethic, integrity, dedication, leadership skills, and \ntrustworthiness with classified information. Applicant\u2019s current income is about $9,000 per \nmonth, and he has about $4,500 in savings. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \n\n \n5 \n \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,  \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n6 \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence are sufficient to establish \nthe disqualifying conditions above. \n \nSix mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that none of the mitigating conditions \nare sufficiently raised by the evidence. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems are frequent, recent, and continued for a number of years. Applicant \nhas filed two Chapter 7 bankruptcies, and is contemplating a third. He failed to file nine \nyears of Federal income tax returns when due. He completed the 2013 to 2018 tax returns \nafter his hearing, and returns for 2010 to 2012 were completed two days before the \nhearing. Evidence of actual filings of the returns was only supplied for tax years 2010, \n2017 and 2018. AG \u00b6 20(g) partially applies to the tax returns actually filed and resolved \nwith the IRS, but does not mitigate the overall failure to file tax returns on time or within a \nreasonable time after missing the deadline. \n \nApplicant and his spouse have suffered from periods of reduced income, illnesses, \njob loss, and a short-term failed business, however, Applicant has not sufficiently \nexplained why those matters prevented him from filing tax returns or paying debts when \ndue, or resolving financial delinquencies in a timely manner. None of the periods in which \nhis difficulties arose fully apply to the delinquent tax filing periods or failure to timely satisfy \ndelinquent debts, and do not mitigate his lapses in financial responsibility. \n \nIt is unclear from the evidence whether the two released state tax liens are related \nto the state sales tax debt alleged in the SOR, however I give Applicant the benefit of the \ndoubt. Resolution of the tax liens are sufficient to satisfy Applicant\u2019s stated debt to the \nstate, as no other evidence exists showing a state sales tax debt exists. Additionally, the \nevidence does not clearly establish a bona-fide dispute was filed over the timeshare \ndebts, but I also give the benefit of the doubt to Applicant who provided evidence of an \neffort to dispute debts. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.e are resolved in favor of Applicant. \n \n \nApplicant established circumstances beyond his control that may have contributed \nto or aggravated his inability to resolve debts in a timely manner, however, I find that \nApplicant failed to establish that he was financially responsible under the circumstances \nand made good-faith efforts to timely resolve the debts as required by mitigating \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (d). In addition, he presented little evidence of reasonable \nefforts to file tax returns until after they became a noted concern that directly impacted \nhis security eligibility. Finally, Applicant has received financial counseling in relation to his \nbankruptcy filings, but despite this, he has not shown clear indications that his financial \nproblems are under control or that he is financially responsible. \n \n \nApplicant intentionally neglected his legal obligation to timely file his Federal \nincome tax returns for a number of years. \u201cFailure to comply with federal and state tax \nlaws suggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding to well-established \nGovernment rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is \nessential for protecting classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 15, 2016). This is true even if the returns have been filed. See, ISCR Case No. 15-\n03481 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2016). His history of bankruptcies and failure to file his \nfederal income tax returns and pay debts in a timely manner, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to \nclassified information. See, ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant failed to demonstrate a history of financial responsibility, and I am unable to \nreasonably determine that future delinquencies and failure to comply with tax obligations \nare unlikely. The financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated except as \nnoted above. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Despite Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of security clearance eligibility, education, and military service, he has not shown \na history of financial responsibility. His personal and family difficulties do not explain his \nblatant and persistent failure to comply with Federal tax law, or to show financial \nresponsibility. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest of the United States to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection with his work with the defense industry. Applicant served on active duty with the Air Force from December 2004 through December 2008. He then served in the Air Force Reserve until April 2015, when he received an Honorable Discharge. He did a period of active duty with the Air Force from April to October 2014.

He presented insufficient evidence \nshowing that he can, or has, resolved these debts. Based on a review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on January 5, 2017. (Government Exhibit 1.) On April 12, 2018, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of Defense on June \n8, 2017. \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on May 9, 2018, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non June 29, 2018. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on July 5, \n2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing \non July 5, 2018. The case was assigned to me on July 10, 2018. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on August 20, 2018. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 \nthrough 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf \nand submitted Applicant Exhibits A through H, which were also admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 31, 2018. The \nrecord was left open at the request of Applicant until September 17, 2018, for the receipt \nof additional documentation. No further documentation was submitted by Applicant and \nthe record closed as scheduled.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old test engineer. He is married with two stepchildren, and \nhas a Bachelor of Science degree. He is seeking to retain a security clearance in \nconnection with his work with the defense industry.  \n \nApplicant served on active duty with the Air Force from December 2004 through \nDecember 2008. He then served in the Air Force Reserve until April 2015, when he \nreceived an Honorable Discharge. He did a period of active duty with the Air Force from \nApril to October 2014. Applicant stated that this period on active duty had an adverse \neffect on his ability to pay his debts due to his drop in pay. (Government Exhibit 1 at \nSections 13A and 15; Applicant Exhibit D; Tr. 38-39.) \n \nApplicant stated that his finances were also adversely affected by his being on \ndisability from September 8, 2017, through February 28, 2018. This status was confirmed \nby medical records contained in his exhibits. This affected his ability to pay the mortgages \nset forth in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b. (Applicant Exhibit A at 4-11; Tr. 29.) \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has a history of past-due indebtedness that can raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the debts set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through \n1.e, with qualifications and explanations. He denied subparagraph 1.f. The total amount \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nof indebtedness Applicant is alleged to be past due and owing is approximately $73,000. \nThe existence and amount of the debts are documented by credit reports dated October \n10, 2017; March 12, 2018; and June 28, 2018. (Government Exhibits 4, 5, and 6.) (See \nGovernment Exhibit 3.)  \n \n \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admitted owing $21,422 for a past-due mortgage on a rental \nproperty. As stated, Applicant maintained that his period on disability severely impacted \nhis ability to maintain his mortgage payments. Applicant submitted documentation to the \nmortgage company to have this mortgage modified. Applicant stated, in Applicant Exhibit \nA, that the proposed modification had been accepted and this debt was in a trial payment \nperiod, which was to end in July 2018. At the hearing he testified that due to an error by \nthe mortgage company the trial payments had not started. Applicant was given an \nopportunity to provide documentation clarifying the current situation concerning this debt. \nSuch documentation was not provided. Based on all the available evidence I find that this \ndebt is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibits A, G, and H; Tr. 32-35, 37, 40-46.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted owing $15,145 for a past-due mortgage on his primary \nresidence. As stated, Applicant maintained that his period on disability severely impacted \nhis ability to maintain his mortgage payments. Applicant submitted documentation to a \nsecond mortgage company to have this mortgage modified. The mortgage company \nagreed, and Applicant stated that he had made two of the required three trial mortgage \npayments that would make the mortgage current. Applicant was given an opportunity to \nprovide documentation verifying his statements as to the payments. Such documentation \nwas not provided. Based on all the available evidence I find that this debt is not resolved. \n(Government Exhibit 3 at 10-11; Applicant Exhibit B; Tr. 30-31, 33, 35-36, 44-45.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing a past-due debt to a credit union for a repossessed \nautomobile in the amount of $29,442. This vehicle was repossessed in December 2015. \nAccording to Applicant two events made it impossible to continue payments on this car. \nFirst, in March 2015 Applicant\u2019s wife was terminated from her employment after a two-\nyear medical leave of absence. Second, the credit union added additional fees to the \npayment amount in order to purchase unnecessary insurance on the vehicle. Applicant \nsubmitted evidence showing that there was valid insurance on the vehicle. He also \nsubmitted evidence showing that he had been in contact with the creditor and its lawyers \nwith his complaints. Applicant testified that the credit union had written off the past-due \namount and provided him with a Form 1099-C. Applicant was requested to provide a copy \nof the Form 1099-C or the applicable year\u2019s tax return. No additional information was \nprovided. Based on the available information, Applicant did not demonstrate this debt has \nbeen resolved, or is legitimately in dispute. This debt is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit \nC; Tr. 47-56.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admitted owing $6,278 for a past-due timeshare debt. He stated that \nhis mobilization to active duty in 2014 affected his ability to pay this debt. However, \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant had not made any recent payments on this debt and did not have a plan to pay \nthis debt in the near future. This debt is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit D; Tr. 57-61.) \n \n \n1.e. Applicant admitted owing $647 for a past-due credit card debt. This debt \nbecame delinquent in 2014. Applicant stated that the failure to pay the debt was due to \nhis military service. Documentation was supplied by Applicant showing that the creditor \nacknowledged his active duty and asked for additional information. He stated that the \naccount was wrongfully closed by the creditor. However, there was no evidence of that \nfact other than Applicant\u2019s testimony. No additional information was provided. Applicant \nhad not made any recent payments on this debt and did not have a plan to pay this debt \nin the near future. This debt is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit E; Tr. 62-65.) \n \n \n1.f. Applicant denied owing the United States Treasury $168. He stated that this \ndebt was due to medical care he received while on active duty that should have been \nhandled by TRICARE. It appears that the debt was incurred during his time on active \nduty. Applicant has made several phone calls attempting to resolve this debt, all to no \navail. This debt does not appear on the Government\u2019s most recent credit report. Based \non all of the available information I find that Applicant has a legitimate dispute concerning \nthis debt. This allegation is found for Applicant. (Government Exhibit 6; Tr. 52, 55.) \n \n \nApplicant provided proof of current income. Applicant stated that his income is \nstable and that he and his wife can \u201crectify all of these debts in due time.\u201d (Applicant \nExhibit F; Tr. 69-74.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations)  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant, based on the evidence, had five delinquent accounts that he could not \nor chose not to resolve. These debts have been in existence for a considerable period of \ntime. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nThe evidence does not establish that any of the above mitigating conditions apply \nto Applicant, except in regard to allegation 1.f, which is found for him due to a legitimate \ndispute under AG \u00b6 20(e). AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because the debts continue to be \ndue and owing. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply in full force. Applicant did have financial issues \ndue to his being off work, and his Air Force service. However, Applicant did not supply \nsufficient information for me to make a conclusion that he had \u201cacted responsibly under \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nthe circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d) also do not apply. Applicant did not provide proof \nof payments to any of his creditors, despite statements that he would do so. Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns created by his financial situation. Paragraph 1 is \nfound against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated his \nsignificant financial difficulties. He remains susceptible to pressure, coercion, and \nexploitation. Continuation of serious financial duress is likely. Overall, the record evidence \ndoes create substantial doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national security \neligibility and a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Dorsey, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConcerns). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 25, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended (Exec. Or.); DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all adjudicative \ndecisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 22, 2018, and elected to have the case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. He admitted all seven of the SOR \nallegations and provided a two-page narrative statement.  \n02/12/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on July 16, 2018, \nwhich included six documents (Items 1-6). A complete copy of the file of relevant material \n(FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections \nand to submit a written response and documents to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by the SOR allegations. He provided a written, undated \nresponse, which was received by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals on August \n23, 2018. With his response, he provided nine documents. The Government\u2019s exhibits \nare admitted as GE 1-6. I have marked Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE) as A-I. All documents \nare admitted without objection.

He earned a high school \ndiploma in June 2006 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics in 2010. He had two periods of \nunemployment after college and a third period of underemployment when he attempted \nto start a business with a friend that ultimately failed. Since June 2014, he has held three \npositions and each with better compensation than the one before. He has held his current \nposition with a defense contractor since October 2016. He submitted his pending security \nclearance application in May 2017 (SCA). He has not held a clearance in the past. (SOR \nAnswer at 2.) \n \n \nApplicant incurred a significant student loan debt to pay for his college degree. He \nhas attempted to defer the repayment of the loans for as long as possible. His wife is \npresently pursuing a master\u2019s degree in a scientific field. They hope that this degree will \nhelp increase her income potential and better position the two of them to pay down his \nstudent debts in a responsible manner in the future. He wrote in his SOR answer that he \nhas been making an effort to pay his debts, except when he took a \u201chiatus to help support \n[his] family during [his] wife\u2019s master\u2019s degree.\u201d The record is unclear what specific steps \nhe took to pay his student loans before his recent \u201chiatus.\u201d At the same time, he and his \nwife have started a family and have child-care expenses to pay as well as their ordinary \nliving expenses. (SOR Answer at 1; AE H.) \n \n \nThe SOR contains eight allegations of student loan debts that are delinquent, have \nbeen referred for collection or are the subject of a court judgment. The original lenders \nare three banks, which provided private loans that have, at least in some cases, been \nassigned to a state agency or the federal government for the purpose of collection. The \ntotal principal amount of the delinquent loans alleged in the SOR is about $65,424. All of \nthe delinquent debts are student loans, according to the Government\u2019s credit reports in \nthe record. (GE 5 and 6.) The record contains no indication that Applicant has incurred \nany consumer or other debts since at least his 2010 college graduation. \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application, dated May 26, 2017 \n(FORM Item 3), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn his FORM response, Applicant argues that his nine exhibits support his position \nthat he is acting responsibly and is making a good-faith effort to begin to repay his student \nloans. AE A reflects a payment to a student loan collection agency of about $281 on July \n30, 2018, on two consolidated loans, the largest of which has an unpaid balance of about \n$22,400. When combined with the second loan referenced in AE A, the total outstanding \ndebt owed to this creditor is about $29,690. Applicant does not explicitly explain the \nconnection between this exhibit and the corresponding debts alleged in the SOR. Given \nthe magnitude of the larger debt, a significant portion of this payment of $281 is possibly \na partial payment of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, which is his largest student loan debt \nof $26,034. No other debt alleged in the SOR is larger than about $11,000. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) \nIf this payment relates to a different student loan debt, then it was not alleged in the SOR. \nThis payment was made about two months after Applicant received and responded to the \nSOR. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s exhibit B is a statement from a student loan collection agency, dated \nAugust 21, 2018. This exhibit reflects that the account was placed for collections in \nNovember 2017 in the amount of $2,115, which is the principal amount of the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. Exhibit B reflects total payments of about $353 and a current balance of \nabout $1,763. It does not provide any information as to when the payments were made \nor in what amounts. The document also reflects an additional, closed student loan from \nApplicant\u2019s college in the amount of $17,207, which had a zero balance in May 2013. The \nrecord is silent as to how this debt was resolved since this student loan was not alleged \nin the SOR. The Government\u2019s evidence references this loan (account no. \n360000881100) in the original amount of $11,000 as being a paid collection, as of May \n2013. (GE 5 at 4.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit C is a receipt of a payment made to a state student financial \naid agency. The receipt reflects a payment on August 20, 2018, in the amount of $285. \nThe following four exhibits are also receipts from the same state agency in the amounts \nof $285 bearing the dates of December 13, 2017, January 14, 2018, March 1, 2018, and \nJune 22, 2018, respectively (AE D-G.) Applicant failed to identify which student loan or \nloans alleged in the SOR are related to these receipts. According to the record evidence, \nthe only SOR debt that is owed to this state agency is the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. This \nraises the possibility that the debt addressed by the payment reflected in AE A is a debt \nthat is not alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nWithout a more detailed explanation from Applicant, I can only conclude that his \nevidence is intended to show that he has made payments on two or possibly more of his \nstudent loan debts, whether alleged in the SOR or not. He presents this evidence in \nsupport of his claim that he intends to continue paying these debts at this time and intends \nto pay all remaining debts alleged in the SOR when he has more income available to him \nin the future \n \n \nAppellant Exhibit H sets forth his budget without any explanation. He shows a \nmonthly net family income of about $7,781. He lists his \u201cRequired\u201d expenses as totaling \n\n \n4 \n \nabout $5,099 and his \u201cvoluntary\u201d expenses as about $226. His budget then reflects a \nremainder for \u201cDiscretionary/Savings\u201d as the difference of his net monthly family income \nand their monthly expenses, i.e., about $2,682, which is about $32,184 per year. His \nbudget also provides a \u201cYearly Net\u201d figure of about $39,763. This figure is calculated using \nhis monthly numbers with some annual adjustments. The difference between these \nnumbers is not explained by his annual adjustments. It is unclear how he explains the \ndifference in his annual remainder income.  \n \n \nApplicant Exhibit H also set forth a student loan repayment plan in a very summary \nmanner. His plan shows a \u201cyear one\u201d debt of $114,560, which is more than double the \ntotal of the student loans set forth in the SOR. This figure suggests that the student loan \npayment evidenced by AE A was made on a debt that was not alleged in the SOR. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s apparent total debt of $114,560 supports the possibility that he \nand/or his wife may have more student loan debts, or other debts, than those alleged in \nthe SOR. At the end of year one, Applicant\u2019s repayment plan shows a remaining figure of \nabout $40,000 less, i.e., $74,797. In year two, the plan shows a similar reduction, leaving \na remainder of about $38,431. He shows the remainder of the debt being paid off by the \nend of year three. (AE H.) \n \n \nApplicant also submitted with his FORM response his most recent performance \nevaluation. His evaluating supervisor praised Applicant\u2019s performance and rated him as \nhaving a \u201cSubstantial Impact\u201d on the company and that Applicant \u201cperformed well above \nexpectations.\u201d (AE I.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n\n \n5 \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR Answer and response to the FORM and the \ndocumentary evidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. While Applicant\u2019s debts arose a number of years \nago, they remain delinquent. His failure to address them in any serious manner prior to \nreceiving the SOR in 2018 casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and \njudgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant assumed this student debt to further his \neducation. Upon graduation from college in 2010, however, he was obliged, to develop a \nrepayment plan. He failed to do so. These circumstances were within his control, and he \nfailed to act responsibly under the circumstances in addressing his student loan debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant wrote in his SOR answer that he has not \nsought financial counseling because he had a simple solution to his problem, which was \nto pay his debts now that he has sufficient income. The evidence does not support his \nassertion that he took his own advice and that his problem is being resolved. Absent a \n\n \n7 \n \ntrack record of regular payments, it is speculative as to whether Applicant will be \nsuccessful in paying down all of his debts within three years as he forecasts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant fails to explain in his FORM response how \nhe intends to actually follow his ambitious debt repayment plan over three years, given \nhis limited payments in the past. He has been unable to make any significant progress \nrehabilitating and repaying his student loans for the past several years, or at least since \nOctober 2016, when he was hired by his current employer. With the apparent exception \nof a loan from his college, the record evidence reflects that Applicant did not attempt to \nbegin making monthly payments or to rehabilitate his delinquent student loans until \nDecember 2017 in one case and sometime in or about 2018 in another. As noted above, \nAE B does not provide the date when Applicant began to make payments on that second \ndebt. Applicant\u2019s failure to address each debt in his FORM response and his repayment \nefforts for each debt renders his mitigating evidence of repayments unpersuasive. Simply \nstated, Applicant has not established the requisite track record with respect to his student \nloans, and it is premature to conclude that he will be able to follow his three-year plan, \nwhen he begins to implement his plan. \n \n \nI conclude that at this time none of the above mitigating conditions apply and that \nApplicant has not made any serious progress on the SOR debts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent student loans. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.h: Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Nussbaum, Esq. \n09/16/2019 \nDecision \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns related to his alcohol-related incidents \nand involuntary military discharge. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 12, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on August 3, 2018, and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 1, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n\n \n2 \n \nnotice of hearing (NOH) on December 21, 2018, scheduling the hearing for February \n21, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n \n With no objection, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend SOR \u00b6 1.c \nby striking the last full sentence, which reads: \u201cAfter a witness notified the police, you \ninitially denied that you were the driver of the vehicle.\u201d Government Exhibits (GE) 1, 3, \nand 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant objected to GE 2, 4, and 5 \non the basis that the documents constituted hearsay and were not business records. I \noverruled Applicant\u2019s objections and admitted GE 2, 4, and 5 in evidence. Applicant \nobjected to GE 7, a Report of Investigation (ROI), on the basis of DOD Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.20 and Department Counsel withdrew the exhibit. Applicant objected to GE 8 on \nthe basis that the documents were duplicative and irrelevant. I overruled Applicant\u2019s \nobjection and admitted GE 8 in evidence. Applicant testified, called three witnesses, and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through N, which were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. (Tr. at 8-9, 12-27). \n \nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open until March 7, 2019, for the receipt \nof additional evidence. By email on March 5, 2019, Applicant stated that he did not have \nany additional documentation. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 4, \n2019.                                                                                                                                                         \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact. He is 27 years old, married, and he has one child, a minor. He has \nowned his home since approximately 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 9, 45-66, 85; GE 1; AE I). \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2010. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nfrom The U.S. Military Academy at West Point (West Point) in 2014 and was \ncommissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He was involuntarily honorably \ndischarged in November 2016. He was unemployed until March 2017, when he became \na systems engineer for his current employer, a defense contractor. As of the date of the \nhearing, he was pursuing his master\u2019s degree and expected to obtain it in May 2020. He \nhas held a security clearance since 2011. (Tr. at 6-7, 85-90, 96-100, 105-115, 144-146, \n163; GE 1, 4, 5, 6; AE D, F, I, K, M, N).  \n \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol when he was a senior in high school. He \ndrank a few beers on occasion. He did not consume alcohol during his first year at West \nPoint, but drank about five to seven beers on the six to seven occasions when he was \non leave from West Point during his second year. His leave increased during his third \nyear and he drank five to seven beers on 12 to 14 occasions. By his fourth year, he \nconsumed six to nine beers approximately once monthly. (Tr. at 164-167; AE I). \n \n \nIn November 2014, Applicant was cited with public drunkenness. He was a 22- \nyear-old flight school student. He described his level of alcohol consumption during this \nperiod as the same as his fourth year at West Point. He and his classmates had just \ncompleted their two-month basic officer leadership course and decided to attend a \n\n \n3 \n \nweekend college football game during their two week break to \u201cblow some steam off.\u201d \nHe drank beer and mixed drinks from early in the day while tailgating, fell asleep \nsometime after the game commenced, and was wakened by a campus police officer for \nsleeping in public and taken to a local drunk tank to get sober. He was cited, pled no \ncontest, and paid his fine. He \u201claid low\u201d from consuming alcohol for a while because he \nwas upset and ashamed of himself. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, 3.a; Tr. at 90-96, 100-103, 146-\n147, 167-168, 171-172; GE 1; AE I).   \n \n \nFrom November 2014 to April 2016, Applicant was \u201cdeep into the training of flight \nschool.\u201d He and his classmates consumed alcohol at a friend\u2019s house or a local bar to \n\u201cenjoy the free time that we did have.\u201d By January 2016, his alcohol consumption had \nincreased to eight to ten beers every weekend. In April 2016, he was arrested and \ncharged with driving under the influence (DUI). This was his first DUI. He was 23 years \nold and a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He was less than one week from flight school \ngraduation and felt \u201con top of the world . . . a little bit invincible.\u201d He attended a party at \na friend\u2019s house with the intention of spending the night. He consumed beer and mixed \ndrinks and drove home. The police stopped him after he took \u201ca right-hand turn out of \nthe straight-only lane\u201d and then a \u201cleft-hand turn without signaling my turn.\u201d Upon his \narrest, he initially denied having consumed alcohol out of fear, but then admitted to \ndrinking during his field sobriety test. His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .16%. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a, 3.a; Tr. at 60, 90-96, 103-117, 147-154, 158-161, 168-169, 172-173; GE 1, \n2, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE I, J, M, N). \n \n \nThe DUI was nolle prossed. The U.S. Army revoked Applicant\u2019s driving \nprivileges; issued him a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand (GOMR) in May \n2016; and notified him in July 2016 that he would be involuntarily honorably discharged. \nHe enrolled in and completed the Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) in May \n2016, through which he received alcohol counseling. He did not consume alcohol for \nthree months from around April to July 2016. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a, 3.a; Tr. at 60, 90-96, \n103-117, 147-154, 158-161, 168-169, 172-173; GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE I, J, M, N). \n \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s involuntary discharge was pending, he was charged with his \nsecond DUI in October 2016. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.a, 3.a). He was 24 years old. He had \nresumed consuming alcohol in July 2016 as self-medication for his depression about his \n\u201cunknown future and unknown fate.\u201d His tipping point occurred in September 2016 when \nhis roommate moved out. He found himself socializing with \u201cbar buddies\u201d who he did not \nreally know and he did not communicate or seek help from his family or friends. On a \nholiday weekend, he consumed alcohol at a Halloween party. He then drove to a bar \nwhere he continued to consume alcohol. On his drive home, he was going too fast upon \narriving at an intersection, tried to turn his car sideways, hit a curb, and flipped his car \ninto a ditch. His BAC was .23%. The DUI was dismissed. He was discharged from the \nU.S Army honorably, due to unacceptable conduct. (SOR \u00b6 3.b; Tr. at 90-96, 108, 117-\n125, 132-133, 154-161, 168-169, 172-174; GE 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE F, I, M, N).   \n \n \nApplicant confided in his parents and wife after his second DUI. During his two- \nto three-week out processing from the U.S. Army, he received alcohol counseling and \ntreatment from the same ASAP counselor as his first DUI. The counselor diagnosed him \n\n \n4 \n \nwith alcohol-related disorder, moderate and recommended that he attend Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) and abstain from alcohol. His father took him to his first AA meeting \nand he attended AA daily for two to three weeks. He testified that he accepted that he is \nan alcoholic at his first AA meeting. He then returned to live with his parents and \ncontinued to attend AA meetings weekly to twice weekly from approximately March \n2017 until April 2018, when he relocated. He attended one to two AA meetings in June \n2018. Since his October 2016 DUI, he consumed alcohol on three occasions when he \nwas with close friends and family: he had three beers at his wedding in December 2016, \nand four to five beers on two occasions in January 2017. (Tr. at 50, 60, 62-66, 121, 125-\n144, 161-164,172-178; GE 1; AE A, I). \n \n \nApplicant has not consumed alcohol since January 2017. He intends to remain \nsober. He testified that although he intends to resume with AA meetings, he does not \nrely on AA to maintain his sobriety. He has instead focused on his family, job, \neducation, exercise, home, church, and friendships that are not centered around \nalcohol. In June 2018, he sought an alcohol evaluation and his previous diagnosis was \nupdated to alcohol-use disorder, moderate in sustained remission. He was \nrecommended to continue with AA and remain sober. He does not have any other \nalcohol-related incidents. He testified that he identified that the root cause of his \nproblems was alcohol, so he completely removed it from his life. He testified: \n \nI don\u2019t regret what happened, because my life has completely turned \naround from it. I think if I didn\u2019t have the second DUI, I would really, truly \n[not] realized I had a problem until something worse might have \nhappened. \n \n (Tr. at 50, 60, 62-66, 121, 125-144, 161-164, 175-178; AE B, C, I). \n  \n \nApplicant disclosed to his previous and current managers his first DUI and his \nconsequent military discharge. He testified that he would disclose his second DUI, but \nhad not done so because he was not so required, since it was not a conviction. He \nreceived a performance evaluation rating of \u201csuccessful\u201d from his employer in 2017 and \nan \u201cexcellent\u201d rating in 2018.  (Tr. at 96-100, 170-171; AE E, G, I, L). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified. She met and began dating Applicant in 2014 and was \naware of his alcohol-related incidents and involuntary discharge from the U.S. Army. \nShe reiterated that he has not consumed alcohol since January 2017. She does not \nconsume alcohol. She testified that though they have found themselves in social \nsituations where alcohol is present, to include through their intramural kickball league, \nshe has no concerns about his ability to maintain sobriety.  She described him as a \nmatured, responsible, determined, self-motivated individual \u201cfocused on his health and \nhis career and family\u201d who has \u201cturned his life around.\u201d She testified that Applicant has \n\u201crealized that alcohol serves no purpose in his life.\u201d (Tr. at 45-66; AE H).  \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s West Point classmates, who was also a roommate on various \noccasions, testified. The witness was serving in the U.S. military on active duty as of the \ndate of the hearing. He was aware of the SOR allegations. He testified that while \n\n \n5 \n \nattending West Point, he, Applicant, and their peers drank fairly often on the weekends. \nThough he did not consider Applicant to have an alcohol problem, he was \n\u201cdisappointed\u201d but \u201cnot completely blindsided\u201d when he learned of Applicant\u2019s DUIs. \nSince graduation, they communicate approximately once monthly and see each other \noccasionally. The witness testified that Applicant informed him about Applicant\u2019s \nsobriety. The witness also observed Applicant practice sobriety on around four \noccasions and stated that he has no concerns with Applicant\u2019s ability to maintain his \nsobriety. He described Applicant as \u201cvery intelligent\u201d and one who has \u201calways done \nvery well at everything he set his mind to.\u201d (Tr.at 33-44; AE G). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s colleague and mentor since 2017 testified. She previously interacted \nwith him daily, but since his relocation in April 2018 they interacted twice weekly. She \ntestified that she was aware of his alcohol-related incidents and involuntary military \ndischarge. She testified that he \u201chas always been one of the highest performing junior \nengineers\u201d who \u201cperforms above his level.\u201d As such, she has given his managers \n\u201cextremely positive\u201d peer feedback for his performance evaluations. She testified that \nshe had been in social situations with Applicant and never observed him consuming \nalcohol. She was aware that he was sober. She considers him to be an honest and \ntrustworthy individual. Numerous professional and social character references describe \nApplicant as a man of exemplary character, with demonstrated integrity and \ntrustworthiness. (Tr. at 66-84; AE G). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n6 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 22. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nApplicant has a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nincidents. He was involuntarily discharged from the U.S. Army as a result of his first \nDUI. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are applicable. \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s DUIs and involuntary military discharge were his wake-up call that he \nis an alcoholic. He has since turned his life around. He attended AA meetings from \napproximately October 2017 to June 2018 and intends to resume doing so. He received \nalcohol counseling in October 2017 and an alcohol evaluation in June 2018 wherein he \nwas diagnosed with alcohol-use disorder, moderate in sustained remission. He has \nestablished a support network in his family, job, education, exercise, home, church, and \nfriendships. He has been sober since January 2017. He understands that alcohol is the \nroot of any of his problems and he is committed to a life of sobriety. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n23(a) and 23(b) are established. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nApplicant pled no contest to his 2014 citation for public drunkenness. He was \ncharged with two DUIs in April and October 2016. Though he was not convicted of \neither DUI, he admitted that he drove under the influence of alcohol. AG \u00b6 31(b) is \nestablished. \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nFor the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline G analysis, AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 16. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. . . . \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nincidents, and his involuntary military discharge reflect questionable judgment and \nunreliability. This information is known among his family. He has also disclosed it to \ncertain friends and colleagues. He disclosed his first DUI and his consequent military \n\n \n9 \n \ndischarge to his former and current managers. I find that AG \u00b6 16(c) applies but 16(e) \ndoes not. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides the following conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \nFor the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline G and J analyses, I find \nthat AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the alcohol consumption, criminal \nconduct, and personal conduct security concerns.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Based upon a review of the pleadings \nand exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nOn May 18, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guidelines D (sexual behavior) E \n(personal conduct) and B (foreign influence). Applicant answered the SOR on June 14, \n2018, and requested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the written \nrecord without a hearing.   \n \nOn July 30, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. \nA complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing four Items, was \nmailed to Applicant on August 10, 2018, and received by him on August 13, 2018. The \nFORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material \nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM.

(Item 4)  After receiving the SOR in 2018, he disclosed his behavior to his employer\u2019s \nlawyer, his security officer, and some good friends in his field.2 (Item 1) \n \n \nOn June 12, 2018 (after the SOR issued on May 18, 2018), Applicant told his wife \nthat he had hired prostitutes in the past.3 He said that he and his wife are resolving this \nissue and remain committed to their marriage. (Item 1) \n \n \nApplicant repeatedly stated that he is not a security risk as a consequence of his \nbehavior. He has never betrayed this country that he has successfully served for 32 years. \nHe continues to play a critical role in his work for a U.S. agency. (Item 1; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant submitted six letters of recommendation from former military and \nprofessional colleagues and supervisors. All of the authors have held or hold security \nclearances and have known Applicant for many years and highly recommend his security \nclearance be reinstated. They attest to Applicant\u2019s impressive record of trustworthiness \nand honesty; work ethic; loyalty and ties to the United States; reliability; and professional \ncompetency. It is not clear whether all of them are aware of the underlying facts in this \ninvestigation. (Item 3: a through g; AE C)  \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR and response to the FORM, Applicant expressed \nremorse and embarrassment over his misconduct and sadness regarding the pain he has \ncaused his wife. He has no intention to repeat his behavior. (Item 1; AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 6220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992, as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on \nJune 8, 2017. \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the pertinent AG. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations of the security concern, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n                                                 \n2 Applicant\u2019s disclosure to his employers appears to have occurred after he received the May 18, 2018 \nSOR. (Item 1) \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s disclosure to his wife occurred on June 12, 2018, two days before he signed his answer to the \nSOR. (Item 1) \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 sets out the security concerns relating to sexual behavior: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 sets out a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nApplicant solicited and engaged the sexual services of prostitutes in 2004, 2014, \nand 2016, while he was visiting Australia and Austria. His actions violated DOD standards \nand the DOD policy articulated in the Combating Trafficking of Persons program. \nEngaging in prostitution is a criminal offense in most U.S. states. However, there is no \nevidence that this conduct is subject to the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States. \nThus, his conduct in Australia and Austria is not a crime. Nevertheless, his sexual \nmisbehavior causes him to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress, and \ndemonstrated a lack of good judgment. The evidence established the above disqualifying \ncondition.   \n \nAG \u00b6 14 describes two conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder this guideline: \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s initial two encounters with prostitutes occurred in 2004, he \nagain hired prostitutes in 2014 and 2016, with his most recent misconduct occurring about \ntwo years ago. Those more recent incidents cast sufficient doubt on his good judgment \nsuch that he failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 14(b).  Applicant revealed his \nmisbehavior to his wife, employer, and possibly one colleague after he received the SOR, \nthereby reducing some potential for exploitation. AG \u00b6 14(c) partially applies in his favor. \nThis conduct cannot be fully mitigated because release or disclosure of information about \nhis involvement with prostitutes can further damage his professional and community \nreputation.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and \n \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while legal \nthere, is illegal in the United States. \n \nThe evidence establishes the above disqualifying condition. Applicant engaged in \nprostitution, which is a type of activity, if known, could adversely affect his personal, \nprofessional, and community standing. Although prostitution is legal in Australia and \nAustria, where he hired prostitutes, that behavior is illegal in almost all jurisdictions in the \nUnited States.  His conduct is also contrary to the Combating Trafficking of Persons \nprogram. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides three conditions that could mitigate security concerns under this \nguideline. They are as follows: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent contacts with prostitutes occurred in 2014 and 2016, which \nindicate insufficient time has passed from which to conclude his past misbehavior does \nnot cast doubt on his current judgment. Applicant acknowledged his past misconduct, but \ndid not present evidence of counseling to address or resolve the underlying factors, which \nhe said contributed to his conduct, which initially took place in 2004, and then in 2014, \nabout 14 years later, and again two years later. The evidence does not establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) or (d). There is some evidence that he has taken steps to \nreduce his vulnerability to exploitation based on his recent disclosure to his wife and \nemployer in 2018, albeit after he received the SOR. AG \u00b6 17(e) applies minimally.  \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated for the reasons discussed in the \nprevious section on Sexual Behavior. \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 describes the security concerns regarding foreign influence: \n \n Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling or residing outside the U.S., that may \nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \n \nApplicant engaged the sexual services of prostitutes while traveling to Australia \nand Austria in 2004, 2014, and 2016. That conduct could create a vulnerability to \nexploitation by the foreign women and their employers. AG \u00b6 7(i) applies. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline. One may apply: \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not had contact with the four foreign women with whom he engaged \nin sex after his one-time encounter with them. He did not disclose his name when he hired \nthem or discuss himself during the time spent with them. He paid cash for their services \nand did not use a credit card. The likelihood that his one-time contact with each of the \nfour women could create a risk of foreign influence is minimal. The evidence establishes \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 8(c). \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n    \nI considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D, E, and B, and in my whole-person analysis. \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of honorable service to DOD on active duty and as a \ncontractor. He has established a successful career, as demonstrated by impressive \nletters of recommendation from supervisors and peers, attesting to his loyalty and good \ncharacter. While those factors weigh in his favor, his involvement with prostitutes and \nfailure to timely disclose that information to his wife and employer create serious security \nconcerns, given his status as a federal contractor and former Air Force major. In 2004, \nhe hired prostitutes on two occasions. Ten years later, in 2014, he hired another \nprostitute. In early 2016, he again hired a prostitute. On May 5, 2016, he disclosed his \nbehaviors during a polygraph test. On May 18, 2018, two years later, DOHA issued an \nSOR alleging security concerns based on his past sexual indiscretions. After receiving \nthe SOR, he spoke to his employer about the matter. About a month later, he told his wife \nabout his conduct. Additional disclosure would damage his professional and community \nreputation and he continues to be vulnerable to exploitation and coercion. Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nfailure to responsibly and timely address his personal behaviors raises unresolved \nsecurity concerns.  \n \n  \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with questions about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He mitigated the foreign influence security concerns, \nbut he did not mitigate the sexual behavior and personal conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline B:  \n \n      FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n            For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation.

Nerney, Esq., The Edmunds Law Firm  \n \n \nFebruary 12, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLokey Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 22, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance applications (e-\nQIP). (Government Exhibit 1.)  On April 10, 2018, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse.  The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 25, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 27, 2018.  The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 15, \n2018, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 7, 2018.  The \nGovernment offered two exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which \n\n \n2 \n \nwere admitted without objection. The Applicant offered three exhibits, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A through C, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nJanuary 11, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 25 years old.  He is not married and has no children.  He has a \nBachelor\u2019s of Science degree.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Software \nDeveloper.  He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment.    \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.   \n \n \nApplicant has a history of illegal drug use that includes the use of cocaine, twice \nfrom about January 2012 to May 2017; the use of marijuana, at least ten times from \nOctober 2012 to May 2014, and the use of Vyvance, on two occasions, a prescription \ndrug not prescribed to him.  Applicant began working for his current employer in \nFebruary 2017, a job with a DoD contractor that he cherished and hoped to have \nsomeday.  This defense contractor, like all defense contractors, has a zero tolerance \ndrug policy.   \n \n \nApplicant stated that he used cocaine on two occasions, once in January 2012, \nand again in May 2017.  The first time was New Years Eve, 2012.  He explained that he \nwas in his second year at college, and at a night club consuming alcohol with his \nsiblings and friends.  Unbeknownst to him, one of his five siblings came up behind him \nand stuck something in his nose, and pulled it out without his consent.  Applicant stated \nthat his nose started bleeding.  He states that he later learned that it was cocaine.  \nApplicant\u2019s second time using cocaine occurred in May 2017.  (Tr. p. 18.)  On this \noccasion, he was in a Las Vegas hotel with some friends.  Applicant was getting ready \nto go out to a club and used cocaine.  On this occasion, Applicant was working for a \ndefense contractor and was aware of the company\u2019s zero drug tolerance policy.    \n   \n \nApplicant also used marijuana while in college from about October 2012 to about \nMay 2014, about ten times.  He stated that he no longer uses marijuana because he \ndoes not like the smell of it.  He also stated that he no longer associates with anyone \nwho uses illegal drugs.  He states that he has no desire to use any illegal drug in the \nfuture.     \n \n \nApplicant admitted to using the prescription drug.  Vuvance \u201ca stimulant,\u201d that \nwas not prescribed to him, from about June 2016 to December 2016.  He stated that he \n\n \n3 \n \nused it twice.  Applicant explained that without asking, he took the drug, without \npermission, from his roommate who had the prescription.  It was during final \nexaminations when Applicant was sick and behind on his studies.  He knew that the \ndrug would help him focus.  Applicant\u2019s roommate asked Applicant if he had taken his \ndrug, and Applicant acknowledged that he had.  (Tr. p. 27.)  Applicant testified that the \nfirst time he took it, the drug did not help him.  The second time he took it, in December \n2016, Applicant was given permission by his roommate to use it.  This time, Applicant \nfound it helpful. He ultimately passed his final exams.  (Tr. p. 28.)   \n \n \nThere is a question as to whether Applicant\u2019s first use of cocaine in January 2012 \nwhen his siblings stuck it up his nose without his consent can really be counted as his \nfirst use of cocaine.  If that first experience with cocaine was not bad enough, what is \nclear is the fact that he chose to use it in May 2017, while working for a defense \ncontractor, and after being made aware of the company\u2019s no drug tolerance policy.  \nApplicant testified that he has since grown up and matured from using illegal drugs.  He \nstated that he now understands the responsibilities that come with working for a \ndefense contractor and holding a security clearance.  He submitted a notarized \nStatement of Intent dated November 1, 2018, swearing to never use illegal drugs again.  \nHe also understands that any future involvement with illegal drugs is grounds for \nimmediate revocation of his national security eligibility.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \n      \n \nA letter from a post-doctoral researcher, who was Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor \nfrom April 2014 to June 2016, before Applicant started working for his current employer, \nindicates that Applicant is considered to be diligent and hard-working.  The writer \nconsiders Applicant to be responsible and trustworthy, and is recommended for a \nsecurity clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)   \n \n \nA letter from a software engineer and friend, who has known the Applicant since \nMarch 2017, and has worked closely with him on several software projects, finds him to \nbe trustworthy and reliable.  Applicant is intelligent, and his work product is held to the \nhighest standard.  Applicant is recommended for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A.)      \n \n \nA letter from his college advisor and supervisor during Applicant\u2019s undergraduate \ncareer at college from 2011 to 2013 indicates that she has watched him grow up from a \nquiet and shy student, to a well-rounded and dedicated scholar and leader.  He is \ndescribed as an honest individual, and a person of high integrity.  He is recommended \nfor a security clearance.  (Applicant Exhibit A.)   \n \n \nTwo letters, one from a systems administrator, who is also a coworker, and one \nfrom a high school friend, attest to Applicant\u2019s honesty, hard-work ethic, and dedication \nto seeing the task through completion.   Applicant is also described as kind, responsible, \nsmart, ridiculously driven, and one of the most capable individuals they have \nencountered.  Applicant is recommended for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \nA.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnrelated to his employment, Applicant voluntarily underwent a drug test on \nOctober 25, 2018, which was negative for illegal drugs.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information) \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains two conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.   \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors demonstrate full mitigation.  Applicant is a young \nand immature man, who is applying for a security clearance, and now promises not to \nuse illegal drugs in the future.  However, in the recent past, even after being hired to \nwork for a defense contractor in February 2017, and cognizant of their zero drug use \npolicies, he used cocaine three months later in May 2017.  There is no excuse for this \nmisconduct, and his actions do not show the requisite good judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified information.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant is a well-respected individual.  His \nmost recent use of any illegal drug was cocaine in May 2017.  This occurred over a year \nand half ago.  This use is considered fairly recent.  More time without drug use will show \nthe Government that Applicant has matured and is sincere about his commitment to a \ndrug free lifestyle.  At this time, he has failed to provide sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that he meets the qualifications for a security clearance.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concern. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His financial delinquencies were attributable \nto circumstances beyond his control and he is acting responsibly by making payments on \nhis debts as he is able. National security eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n02/12/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on May 2, 2018, and requested a \ndecision based on the administrative record. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 27, 2018. Applicant \nreceived it on October 2, 2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 \nthrough 10. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the \nFORM. On October 30, 2018, Applicant submitted a 24-page response to the FORM \n(Response). Items 1 through 10 and the Response are admitted into the record without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on January 16, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.g. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.h, and 1.i. \nThe SOR alleged Applicant had a Federal tax lien entered against him in 2015 for \ndelinquent taxes from unstated years in the amount of $36,130; was delinquent on child \nsupport payments in the amount of $7,759; had a home in foreclosure in November 2014; \nand had six other delinquent consumer accounts totaling $41,102. Applicant disclosed \nthe majority of his debts on his 2016 security clearance application. (Answer; Response; \nItem 4.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old. He has worked in his position since August 2008, \nalthough the contractor for whom he worked changed in 2013. He was unemployed from \nJuly 2006 to January 2007 and May 2008 to August 2008. He was married from 1999 \nthrough 2012. He has three adult children, two from his marriage and one from a prior \nrelationship. He previously had financial difficulties, which led to a discharge of debt \nthrough Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001. (Item 4; Item 5; Item 10.)  \n \nApplicant attributes his delinquent accounts to his contentious divorce and \nunemployment. Their separation and divorce were caused by infidelity on the part of his \nex-wife. (Response; Answer; Item 10.) \n \n \nApplicant was indebted on a Federal tax lien entered against him in 2015 in the \namount of $36,130, as stated in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The tax debt pertains to tax years 2010, 2011, \nand 2012, when Applicant failed to have proper payroll withholdings. He has since \ncorrected his payroll withholdings. In his response, he explained that he has been \nrepaying his tax debts since 2014 in the amount of $700 per month, although his records \ndo not show a steady stream of payments until 2016. Applicant provided IRS tax \ntranscripts and transaction statements from his bank that show Applicant established a \nnew installment agreement with the IRS in April 2016, and has made consistent monthly \npayments since September 2016. His balance for the 2010 tax year had decreased from \n$18,820 to $546, as of October 2018. Once 2010 is resolve, his payments will presumably \nbe applied to his 2011 and 2012 unresolved Federal taxes. Applicant is resolving his \nFederal tax debt. (Answer; Response; Item 10.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was indebted to a credit union on a charged-off account in the amount \nof $20,939, as stated in SOR \u00b6 1.b. In April 2017, Applicant established a payment plan \nwith this creditor to resolve this debt through monthly payments of $300. As of April 19, \n2018, Applicant had repaid $3,800 of this debt, as documented in a letter from this \ncreditor. Applicant is resolving this debt. (Answer; Response.) \n \n \nApplicant was indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $1,621, as \nstated in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant provided a letter from this creditor, dated April 16, 2018, \noffering to settle this account for six payments of $175.66. He indicated he intended to \nresolve this debt as funds allow. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant was indebted on a collection account owed to a telecommunications \nservice provider in the amount of $165, as stated in SOR \u00b6 1.d. This debt was incurred \nwhen Applicant switched service providers, but was unaware of the delinquency. He paid \nthis debt on April 21, 2018. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife purchased a residence in December 2004 for $542,000, \nfinanced through a mortgage. Applicant paid that loan through May 2011, until he moved \nout due to his separation. For a year prior to moving out, he attempted to sell the property, \nbut its value had declined and was worth less than what he owed on the mortgage. He \nreceived an offer that the bank approved, but his ex-wife would not sign the required \ndocuments needed to sell the property in 2012. He provided a copy of the real-estate \nlisting and the purchase offer. His home was foreclosed upon by the mortgage holder in \napproximately November 2014, as stated in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Applicant was delinquent on a \nhome-owners association fee related to this property, totaling $5,032, as stated in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e. (Answer.) This debt was for homeowners association fees incurred after he moved \nout of the property and added assessments for not maintaining the yard after he vacated \nthe property. Applicant credibly asserted that he contacted this creditor and was told this \ndebt was resolved. (Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant was delinquent on a judgment filed against him in September 2010 in \nthe amount of $17,721, as stated in SOR \u00b6 1.f. This account became delinquent after \nAppellant was laid off. He claimed to have a payment plan in place with this creditor. He \nprovided nothing further in this regard. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant was delinquent on his child support obligation in the amount of $7,759, \nas stated in SOR \u00b6 1.h. This debt was for his first child. He was unable to pay child support \nduring his periods of unemployment. Applicant documented regular, $150 monthly \npayments on this debt. His balance has been reduced to $3,934. Applicant is resolving \nthis debt. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant was delinquent on a collection account in the amount of $656 as stated \nin SOR \u00b6 1.i. He denied this debt because he contacted both the collection agent and the \noriginal creditor \u201cand both companies do not have information relating to amount balance \nor records stating that there\u2019s an amount owed.\u201d (Answer.) He indicated he was \u201cready, \nand able to pay\u201d but the creditor could find no record of this debt. (Answer.)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations since at least 2010. \nHe lost his home in foreclosure in 2014. He failed to timely pay his Federal income tax, \nwhich resulted in a 2015 tax lien filed against him. He also accumulated delinquent \nconsumer debt as a result of his 2012 divorce and periods of unemployment. There is \nsufficient evidence to raise substantial security concerns under the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant experienced financial problems that were due to events beyond his \ncontrol, including his divorce and two periods of unemployment. He documented that he \nhas been resolving his Federal tax debt in a responsible manner by presenting records \nof regular monthly payments since 2016. He also documented that he has been \nresponsibly addressing his child-support arrearages, which occurred due to his \nunemployment, in a responsible manner. He reduced that balance from $7,759 to $3,934. \nAn applicant is not required to resolve every debt. However, an applicant must \ndemonstrate a plan for debt payment, accompanied by concomitant conduct. Here \nApplicant presented evidence of a serious intent to resolve his debts, as his funds allow. \nHe has been in contact with the alleged creditors. He fully resolved the debt identified in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. He documented that he is making payments on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.h. He \ndocumented he is working with the creditor to develop a payment plan to resolve SOR \u00b6 \n1.f. He believes he no longer is liable for the debts identified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, and 1.i, \ndue to the foreclosure of the home and/or his conversations with those creditors. He has \nacted reasonably, and in good faith to resolve the delinquencies he could, with the funds \navailable. His financial problems were caused by situations beyond his control, he is \naddressing them in a responsible manner, and they are unlikely to recur. The above \nconditions provide mitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has made substantial \nefforts to resolve his alleged debts in a responsible manner, as his funds allow. The record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nNational security eligibility is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nJennifer I.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n06/13/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant incurred four alcohol-related offenses between June 2012 and June \n2015. Since then, however, he has largely abstained from drinking. Through marriage, \nfatherhood, and overall maturity, he has shown that his alcohol issues are in the past and \nunlikely to recur. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol-\nrelated conduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in February 2017. On \nSeptember 10, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline G, alcohol involvement. The DOD CAF issued the SOR under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security \n\n \n2 \n \n \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), (December \n10, 2016), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 6, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The case \nwas assigned to me on January 3, 2019. On February 1, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for February 20, 2019.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified but submitted no exhibits. I held the record open to allow him the \nopportunity to submit additional documentation. He subsequently submitted three \ncharacter letters, which were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A through C and \nadmitted without objection. The record closed on March 8, 2019. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on March 6, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all four allegations in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a- 1.d), with an explanation. \nI have incorporated his admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old. He and his wife were married in November 2014. They \nhave a four-year-old son, and at the time of the hearing, were expecting another child. \nApplicant has attended some community college, and has some technical training. He \nserved as a helicopter mechanic in the United States Marine Corps Reserve (USMCR) \nfrom April 2009 until March 2017. He served about two years on active duty, providing \nhumanitarian post-disaster relief in Haiti in 2010, and was also on active duty until mid-\n2012 for various training duties. He was discharged honorably as a sergeant (E-5). (Tr. \n21-22, 45, 47-51, 73, 83-84; GE 1, GE 2) \n \n \nAfter holding several other civilian jobs, Applicant began working in the defense \nindustry in late 2015. He was hired by his current employer in January 2017, in the field \nof aviation maintenance. Since July 2017, Applicant has worked in Afghanistan, a month \nat a time, followed by a month off at home. (Tr. 45-46, 62; GE 1) Applicant commented at \nhearing that he loves working on helicopters and that it is the only job at which he excels.  \nThis is his first application for a security clearance. He earns an annual salary of about \n$125,000. (Tr. 21-23, 76; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant began drinking at age 18. He would often become intoxicated on \nweekends. (Tr. 23-25) In June 2012, when he was 22 years old, Applicant was outside \nwith friends after drinking at a bar and they were \u201cbeing loud.\u201d The police were called, and \nApplicant was \u201crude to the officer.\u201d Applicant allegedly \u201cblacked out\u201d and was unable to \nrecall the incident the next day. He was detained and cited for public swearing and \nintoxication, and was fined $25. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) (Tr. 26-27, 51; GE 1 at 42-43; GE 3) During \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhis detention, Applicant was screened by an assessor for alcohol and mental health \nissues. He was advised to stop drinking. (Tr. 27-28, 55-57) \n \n \nIn November 2013, Applicant was driving home from a party when he was pulled \nover for speeding. He had consumed several drinks, and the officer smelled alcohol in \nthe car. After a field sobriety test, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while \nintoxicated (DWI) and speeding. In about March 2014, he was found guilty, fined, and \nordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and alcohol safety awareness \nprogram (ASAP) classes. The court also ordered that an ignition interlock system be \ninstalled in his car. His driver\u2019s license was restricted for six months, and he was placed \non two years of probation. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) (Tr. 29-33, 51-53; GE 1 at 43-44; GE 3) \n \n \nIn October 2014, Applicant failed an ignition interlock test. He was charged with \nbeing non-compliant with the ASAP program. He pleaded not guilty, asserting that the \npositive ignition test was caused by cologne. In February 2015, he was tried and found \nguilt. He was fined and ordered to spend two days in jail. He was also referred to an \nalcohol program for an alcohol assessment and appropriate substance abuse treatment. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) (Tr. 31-33, 51-53; GE 1 at 44; GE 3) As he did during his court case, Applicant \nasserted during his hearing testimony that the ignition interlock results were caused by \ncologne. He said he had not been drinking at the time. (Tr. 53) \n \n \nApplicant entered the outpatient alcohol treatment program in March 2015. He \nasserted in his intake interview that he had not had any alcohol since November 2013. \nHe completed a substance abuse screening assessment, and he was diagnosed as \nsuffering from alcohol dependence. (GE 4 at 91, 102) The diagnosis is not alleged in the \nSOR.  \n \n \nApplicant was referred to a 16-week substance-abuse class. (GE 4 at 23, 91) \nApplicant signed an acknowledgement that he was to abstain from alcohol consumption \nduring the treatment program. (GE 4 at 33; Tr. 37) He attended group counseling sessions \nthrough AA about twice a week. (Tr. 65-67) \n \n \nIn June 2015, while in the alcohol treatment group program, Applicant went to visit \na friend in another state who was experiencing a mental health crisis. They went to a bar, \nand Applicant had three beers and a mixed drink over several hours. Applicant got into a \nfight, and punched another patron in the face. He was charged with public drunkenness \nand harassment, and fined. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) (Tr. 37-38, 53-55; GE 1 at 45; GE 3)  \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose the incident at his next AA group counseling session. \n(GE 4 at 53-75, 81) He said at hearing that he did not disclose the incident at the time \nbecause he had been embarrassed about it. (Tr. 38-39, 55)  \n \nApplicant was discharged successfully from the group program in August 2015. \n(GE 4 at 79) He was to attend additional counseling sessions for recovering addicts at his \nfamily\u2019s church, similar to an AA program. Applicant did not follow through with those \n\n \n4 \n \n \nsessions because he was concerned about the program\u2019s confidentiality, due to the \nprogram\u2019s location. He has not participated in additional AA meetings since then. (Tr. 39-\n41, 68-70)  \n \n \nApplicant has significantly curtailed his drinking. He said the last time he consumed \nany alcohol was on New Year\u2019s Eve 2018, when he consumed one large beer at a party \nat his in-law\u2019s house. He did not drive that evening. (Tr. 41-44, 58-61, 78-80; GE 2 at 2, \n17)  \n \n \nApplicant has not sought an alcohol assessment from a medical provider to update \nhis 2015 diagnosis of alcohol dependence. He has not had any offenses or arrests since \nJune 2015. (Tr. 71) \n \n \nApplicant disclosed his offenses on his SCA. He acknowledged his misconduct, \nbut said he had stopped drinking and had dedicated himself to caring for his wife and son. \n(GE 1 at 52)  \n \n \nAt hearing, Applicant acknowledged his wrongdoing and poor decision-making. He \nblamed his prior actions on \u201cyoung, immature stupidity.\u201d He said he has matured \nsignificantly since he has had the responsibility of raising a young family. He testified that \nhe knows he has \u201ctoo much to lose\u201d by consuming alcohol again. He and his wife recently \npurchased a home, and he was recently promoted at work, in a job that requires a \nclearance. Tr. 21-23-44, 71-77) \n \nApplicant keeps no alcohol in his house. The people he and his wife socializes with \nnow are young parents. He no longer drinks at bars. When he is home from Afghanistan, \nApplicant works in his garage restoring a car, and manages child care for his son, since \nhis wife works. (Tr. 71-77) Alcohol is not available in Afghanistan, so there is no \nopportunity for him to drink when he is working there. (Tr. 46-47, 63, 70) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife wrote a supportive reference letter, in which she attests to her \nhusband\u2019s growth and maturity as a husband and father. He is hardworking, dependable, \nand honest. Applicant\u2019s supervisor in Afghanistan attested to his maturity, \nprofessionalism, and integrity. He is a dedicated professional, and is entrusted with \nreleasing aircraft as \u201csafe for flight,\u201d a serious responsibility upon which lives depend. The \nsupervisor wishes there could be \u201cten more just like him.\u201d A personal friend attested to \nApplicant\u2019s character as a husband, father, and proud veteran. (AE A, AE B, AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \nNo one has a right to a security clearance. As the Supreme Court held in \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (484 \nU.S. at 531)  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist; psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) or alcohol use disorder;  \n \n \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and  \n(f) alcohol consumption which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  \n \n \n \nAs alleged in the SOR, and admitted, Applicant incurred four alcohol-related \noffenses between June 2012 and June 2015. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies.  \n \n \nFollowing an ignition interlock violation in October 2014, Applicant was ordered to \nparticipate in alcohol treatment. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence in March \n2015. He was also ordered to attend AA and alcohol safety awareness classes. During \nhis treatment and counseling, he was to abstain from alcohol. In June 2015, he consumed \nalcohol at a bar with a friend, and also got into a fight with another patron, leading to his \nmost recent alcohol-related offense. Applicant consumed alcohol following his diagnosis \nof alcohol dependence, and against treatment advice to abstain. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e) and 22(f) \ntherefore apply.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol dependence itself, while supported by the record \nevidence, is not specifically alleged in the SOR. I therefore cannot consider it as \ndisqualifying conduct. Thus, AG \u00b6 22(d) does not technically apply. However, I can \nconsider the diagnosis, and Applicant\u2019s subsequent actions, in weighing mitigation or \nchanged circumstances, whether Applicant has demonstrated sufficient rehabilitation, \nunder the whole-person concept, and in weighing his credibility. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n \n \nApplicant incurred four alcohol-related offenses in three years, from June 2012 to \nJune 2015, when he was in the Marine Corps. His most recent such offense occurred \nafter a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. While he completed the alcohol treatment \n\n \n7 \n \n \nprogram successfully, he did not inform the treatment providers and counselors about his \nJune 2015 arrest. He also did not participate in AA or aftercare, as recommended. This \nevidence weighs against mitigation, though, as noted, it is not alleged in the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant has, however, largely abstained from alcohol since then. He last \nconsumed alcohol on New Year\u2019s Eve 2018, when he had one large beer at a party at a \nfamily member\u2019s home. He has no criminal arrests or citations, alcohol-related or \notherwise, since June 2015, almost four years before the hearing. There is no record \nevidence of subsequent instances of intoxication.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant is working in Afghanistan every other month, he benefits from a \nmandatory alcohol-free environment. When he is home on leave, he is a dutiful and \nresponsible husband and father. He does not consume alcohol, nor does he appear to \nsocialize with those who do. He has therefore demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence. \n \n \nBy his own admission, Applicant has had a checkered past, and has had difficulty \nexercising good judgment and impulse control when he consumes alcohol. However, he \ncredibly attested that he has matured significantly since his Marine Corps days, and \nrightly recognizes that as a husband and young father with a six-figure income, he has an \nincreased responsibility to his family, and cannot afford to squander his new-found \nprofessional opportunity. With this maturity, Applicant has largely abstained from alcohol \nsince the events alleged in the SOR. I therefore conclude that Applicant has \ndemonstrated that his alcohol issues are unlikely to recur and are no longer a security \nconcern. He has provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the alcohol-related security \nissues under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline G in my \nwhole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the alcohol involvement security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He stated that he had a \nhousehold reduction in income of 30% and he depleted his 401k account to make \nmortgage payments during his period of unemployment. 3   \n \nThe single debt in the amount of $31,702 alleged in the SOR was for a credit \ncard account that was opened in April 1998 and Applicant\u2019s March 2017 credit bureau \nreport reflects the last activity on that account was in November 2012. (Item 5) In his \nJanuary 2018 PSI, Applicant stated that his financial problems were due to his \nunemployment for six months in 2012, and he is now capable of meeting financial \nexpenses  and paying the delinquent debt if needed. (Item 4) He stated his \u201cplans to \ncontact this creditor and make payment arrangements within 3 months if there is still an \noutstanding balance.\u201d4 He was given the opportunity to provide additional \ndocumentation regarding the financial delinquency. He only provided documentation \nshowing that his mortgage account is current with no past due payments. (attachment to \nItem 4) The delinquent credit-card debt is the only allegation in the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant provided no response to the FORM or evidence that he received \nfinancial counseling. He provided no budget showing income against expenses, or other \ndocumentation to show progress on his delinquent debt. He professed his intentions to \nrepay this delinquency in his SCA in November 2016, and in his PSI in January 2018. \nHe produced no documentary evidence that he has done so.    \n \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s November 18, 2016 \nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA) (Item 3), or his personal security interview (PSI) on January 17, \n2018. (Item 4)  \n \n2 Item 3.  \n \n3 Item 3, at 29. \n \n4 Item 4, p. 4. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \n                                            Policies \n \n \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Administrative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), effective within the DOD on June 8, \n2017.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful \nweighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napply here:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and   \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt alleged in the SOR is confirmed by his credit reports \nand answer to the SOR. The Government produced substantial evidence to support the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b) and 19(c), thereby shifting the burden to \nApplicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.5 \n                                                          \n5 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant has not met that burden.  The sole delinquent debt alleged in the SOR has not \nbeen adequately addressed.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;     \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant endured a six month period of unemployment six years ago, and a \ndownturn in the economy. Arguably, these conditions were beyond his control. Yet, \ndespite his knowledge two years ago that this delinquency might affect his eligibility for \na security clearance when he completed his SCA, and then reinforcing his intention to \nmake payment arrangements in his PSI, he has done nothing to resolve this account. \nHe has produced no relevant or responsive documentation either with his Answer to the \nSOR, or in response to the FORM. He has not demonstrated that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Applicant has the burden to provide sufficient evidence to \nshow that his financial problems are under control, and that his debts were incurred \nunder circumstances making them unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s credit report and SOR \nlist the delinquent debt to a bank totaling $31,702. Applicant did not provide enough \ndetails with documentary corroboration about what he did to address his SOR debt. He \ndid not provide documentation relating to any of the SOR debts: (1) proof of payments, \nsuch as checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter from the \ncreditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditors; (2) correspondence \n\n \n6 \n \n \nto or from the creditors to establish maintenance of contact;6 (3) credible debt disputes \nindicating he did not believe he was responsible for the debts and why he held such a \nbelief; (4) more evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, such as settlement \noffers or agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve these debts; or (5) other \nevidence of progress or resolution. Applicant failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(e) because he did not provide documented proof to substantiate the existence, \nbasis, or the result of any debt disputes. \n \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel informed Applicant that it was important for \nhim to provide corroborating or supporting documentation of resolution of the debt in the \nSOR. (FORM at 3) Aside from Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated statements, there is no \ndocumentary evidence that Applicant paid, arranged to pay, settled, compromised, or \notherwise resolved the SOR debt. He did not describe financial counseling or provide \nhis budget. The record lacks corroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed \nexplanations of the causes for his financial problems and other mitigating information. \nThe FORM advised Applicant that he had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM \u201cin \nwhich to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, \nmitigation, or explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any \nadditional information . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a \ndetermination based solely\u201d on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 3) \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n                                                          \n6 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or his] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Notably, Applicant has gone through unemployment \nand an unexpected loss of household income. He has been employed most of his adult \nlife, with the exception of the six month period of unemployment in 2012. Most \nimportantly, Applicant has not addressed the specific allegation in the SOR. Instead, he \nhas made hollow promises of his intent to repay his delinquent debt. He has not met his \nburden of production.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a security concern. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. He has not met his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n Subparagraph 1.a:              \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n                                                    Robert J.

Applicant responded to the SOR on June 18, 2018, \nand elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on August 6, 2018.

He is single without children.1 \n \n \nApplicant smoked marijuana when he was in college and graduate school and \nless frequently after he graduated. He held a security clearance when he worked for a \ndefense contractor from 2007 to 2011. He reported on a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) in April 2017 that he used marijuana on about 60 occasions \nbetween 2002 and 2016, including while holding a security clearance.

Since the experience on October 31st, I haven\u2019t used it since. \nI have never purchased it, nor any related paraphernalia. Upon conducting \nthe clearance interview [in December 2017], I realized that I would not \nwant to jeopardize my employment for its occasional use.3 \n \nIn his June 2018 response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he was an \ninfrequent marijuana user, and that he \u201cclearly underestimated the gravity and severity \nof choosing to use marijuana during this specific period [2009-2011] under which [he] \nheld a clearance.\u201d His marijuana use never adversely affected his job performance, and \nhe volunteered to work in Iraq. He now fully understands that marijuana use is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. He moved to a different city, away from \nthe people with whom he used marijuana.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24:   \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana, including while holding a security clearance. The \nabove disqualifying conditions are applicable. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \n \n \nApplicant has not used marijuana since October 31, 2017. He stated that he has \nmatured and realizes that his past marijuana use was unacceptable, and that he will \nnever use illegal drugs again. He signed a statement of intent not to use any illegal \ndrugs in the future. He is credited with his honesty and truthfulness throughout these \nproceedings. However, he used marijuana while holding a security clearance and after \nhe submitted an SF 86 in which he stated that he did not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture. Applicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. His illegal drug use is not mitigated. AG \u00b6 26(a) is not applicable, and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is partially applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCurry, Marc E., Administrative Judge: \n Applicant failed to carry that burden of proving that her financial delinquencies no \nlonger pose a security concern. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, explaining why it was unable to find it \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant security clearance eligibility for her. The \nDOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Nat. Sec. Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn May 2, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations, denying both \nsubparagraphs. She requested a decision based on the written record rather than a \nhearing. On May 24, 2018, Department Counsel prepared a file of relevant material \n02/25/2019\n\n2 \n \n(FORM).  Applicant received the FORM on June 11, 2018, and was notified that she could \nfile a reply, together with attachments supplementing the information in the FORM, if \ndesired. She did not file a reply. The FORM was assigned to me on July 30, 2018. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nItem 4 at pages five through ten is an unauthenticated summary, prepared by an \ninvestigator, of Applicant\u2019s interview conducted on November 15, 2016. In Applicant\u2019s \nAnswer to the SOR, she characterized it as a \u201ctotally inaccurate assessment of the facts \nfrom [their] prior meeting.\u201d (Item 2 at 3) Moreover, she questioned the agent\u2019s \nprofessionalism and objectivity. (Item 2 at 3) I am going to construe these statements as an \nobjection to its admissibility. Because the document is both unauthenticated and disputed, I \nhave granted Applicant\u2019s objection, and will not consider it in my decision. (Directive, \nAdditional Procedural Guidance \u00b6 E3.1.20) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n Applicant is a 63-year-old woman, twice divorced, with two adult children. She has a \nhigh school diploma, and she served in the U.S. Air Force National Guard from 1977 to \n1979. She was discharged honorably. Since 2014, she has worked for a defense \ncontractor as a senior subcontracts administrator. (Item 3) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a delinquent credit card in the amount of $25,098 (subparagraph \n1.a), and a deficiency stemming from a car repossession, totaling $9,418 (subparagraph \n1.b). Applicant admits that she incurred the debts in 2010, but denies being currently \nresponsible for them, as they have been charged off her credit report. (Item 4 at 3) She \nwas aware of the debts when she completed interrogatories in March 2018, but had no \nintention of paying them, as the seven-year statute of limitation was set to elapse within a \nyear of answering the interrogatories. (Item 4 at 3) \n \n \nThe Government propounded interrogatories to Applicant in 2018. Interrogatory \nnumber two asked her to list any delinquencies and to provide documents as to what she \nwas doing to resolve them, noting as follows: \n \nSimply a written statement that you are making payments on a debt or that a \ndebt was paid, disputed, repossessed, charged off or otherwise not your \nresponsibility, is not sufficient documentation. You must also provide valid \nPROOF of whatever claims you are making concerning each account.  \n \nApplicant contends that she is financially stable, as she recently was approved for a \nhome loan at a favorable interest rate, and that no problems arose when the \nmortgage company checked her credit.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. . . . .  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies trigger the application of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s case relies almost exclusively on her contention that her delinquent debts pose \nno security concern because they are no longer legally enforceable. This \n\n4 \n \nargument is inconsistent with industrial security clearance law. Specifically, debts remain \nrelevant for security clearance purposes even if they are no longer enforceable due to the \nrunning of the statute of limitations. (ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun 6, \n2008)(citing ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul 20, 2005)) Moreover, Applicant\u2019s \ndecision to rely on the running of the statute of limitations rather than pay her debts, which \nshe expressed in her interrogatory responses in March 2018, does not constitute a good- \nfaith effort to resolve her financial difficulties. (Id.)  \n \n \nAlthough reliance on the running of the statute of limitations to avoid paying one\u2019s \ndelinquent debts has minimal probative value, it is not per se disqualifying. Whether the \ncircumstances surrounding the incurrence of the debt were out of her control, whether \nApplicant has followed the IRS requirements for reporting canceled debt, whether she has \nbeen receiving counseling, or whether she is currently financial stable are examples of \nother factors that could collectively mitigate the security concern. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) - 20(d)) \nApplicant, however, offered minimal evidence in support of any mitigating conditions. Given \nthe amount of the delinquencies, and the lack of information about how they were incurred, \nor what efforts Applicant may have attempted to resolve them before the statute of \nlimitations on their collectability expired, there is insufficient evidence for me to conclude \nthat she mitigated the security concern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI considered the whole-person concept factors in my disposition of the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions. I conclude Applicant has failed to carry the burden. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 25, 2017. \nAfter reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on April 23, 2018, \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant \nanswered the SOR on May 11, 2018, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \nDOHA assigned the case to another administrative judge in September 12, 2018, \nand reassigned it to me on November 29, 2018. The notice of hearing was issued on \nOctober 25, 2018, setting the hearing for November 29, 2018. At the hearing, the \nGovernment offered seven exhibits (GE 1 through 7).

All exhibits were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 7, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR 13 financial allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.m). He submitted comments in mitigation and explanation noting that he \nhad filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and was anticipating the discharge of all \nremaining SOR debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.m) in the near future, releasing him of any legal \nobligation to pay those debts. (Answer to SOR) His SOR admissions and those at his \nhearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is 35 years old. He graduated from high school in 2001, and has \ncompleted no additional formal education. He married in 2006, and has five children \n(two biological, one foster child, and two adopted) ages 16, 10, 3, and 2 (twins).  \n \nApplicant has been working for federal contractors since 2007. He has performed \nthe same work, but for several federal contractors depending on who held the contract. \nHe was granted a secret clearance in 2008, which has been continued to present. \nApplicant was hired by his current employer and clearance sponsor in January 2017. He \nseeks the continuation of his clearance which is required for his work with his current \nemployer.  \n \nIn response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2017 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed he was seeking assistance to resolve his financial problems, and alluded to \nattempts to refinance his home, a car, and a late mortgage payment. He noted that he \nhad notified his facility security officer (FSO) of his financial problems. He also stated \nthat he consulted an attorney in October 2017, with a view to filing Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, and was in the process of setting up a credit counseling class.  \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant attributed his financial problems to the higher \ncost of medical insurance, out-of-pocket medical expenses, medical leave, reduced \nincome due to being in disability, remodeling his home for his growing family, his \ninability to refinance his home, having to purchase a home water treatment system, and \nthe reduction on his wife\u2019s working hours, and ultimately her unemployment to take care \nof their children in October 2017. \n \nApplicant has been continuously employed since 2007, with no periods of \nunemployment. However, he was out of work due to undergoing surgery and was \nplaced on disability between April and October 2018. While in short-term disability (April \nthrough August 2018), his income was reduced by $1,000 per month, and while in long-\nterm disability (September through October 2018), his income was further reduced by \nan additional $300 per month.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAt hearing, Applicant acknowledged that his financial problems were partially due \nto him making poor financial decisions. He noted that he went through periods where he \nused his credit cards to supplement his and his family\u2019s income and to pay for their \nliving expenses and yearly vacations. (Tr. 31, 92) He averred that other expenses were \ndue to circumstances beyond his control. (Tr. 26) As examples, he noticed the cost of \nhis daughter\u2019s braces, totaling $5,000 that he incurred after his insurance denied \npayment in in 2017. He took a loan to pay for his daughter\u2019s braces in August 2018. He \nalso noted an unknown number of expensive fertility tests that his wife underwent to \ndetermine why they could not have more children in about 2012-2013. (Tr. 28) \n \nAfter the tests, Applicant and is wife decided to adopt, and they incurred \nadditional expenses to get their home certified for the adoptions, including, a home \nwater filtration system at a cost of over $5,500. He later defaulted on that account\u2019s \npayments. The debt was included in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and Applicant claimed \nhe reaffirmed the debt after his bankruptcy discharge. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) However, as of his \nhearing date, he had not set up a payment plan to pay this creditor. \n  \nConcerning his yearly vacations, Applicant testified that his family have been \ntaking \u201cone big [vacation] once a year\u201d during the last six years. They drive to Florida for \na week to 10 days, and try to stay with family. (Tr. 93) Sometimes, Applicant would take \nleave without pay and use his credit cards to pay for his vacation expenses. At his \nhearing, he acknowledged that it was a poor decision to spend money you do not have. \n(Tr. 83) \n \nApplicant and his wife bought a small house in 2003 and lived in it until 2011. \nThey rented a residence between June 2011 and April 2012. Sometime between 2010 \nand 2011, Applicant took a $10,000 personal loan to consolidate his debts. (Tr. 54) That \nloan remained delinquent until it was discharged through bankruptcy in 2018. In 2013, \nApplicant took a $10,000 loan to purchase a car for his wife. In November 2017, \nApplicant voluntarily returned a car to the creditor because he no longer could afford the \npayments. The residual debt after the sale of the car was also discharged through \nbankruptcy. \n \nApplicant purchased their current home in 2012. He explained that up until then, \nall the furniture they had was second hand. When they bought their current home they \nbought new furniture (a lawn mower, tools, a generator, a snow blower, etc.) and \nacquired a significant debt. (Tr. 65-66) He took another personal loan to consolidate his \ndebts. (Tr. 58) He claimed some of the debt was paid, but some carried on over time. \n(Tr. 32) \n \nIn 2016, Applicant took a $50,000 personal loan to consolidate debts and use the \nremaining balance to finish his house basement. (Tr. 31, 36, SOR \u00b6 1.g) He used part of \nthe $50,000 loan to pay previous debt consolidation loans. (Tr. 56) His plan was to \nfinish the house basement, anticipating based on his own research, that the house \nreappraisal would be at least $40,000 to $50,000 higher. He then would refinance the \nhouse for the higher value and take some of his equity money to pay off the $50,000 \n\n \n4 \n \n \npersonal loan. However, Applicant\u2019s mortgage payment became 30-days delinquent in \nOctober 2017, and he no longer qualified for the refinancing loan.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s income was insufficient to pay for his living expenses and \naccumulated debts. He had maxed out his credit cards and was unable to pay them. In \nabout October 2017, he consulted with a bankruptcy attorney, and scheduled his credit \ncounseling classes. He notified his facility security officer of his financial problems in \nDecember 2017. He filed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2018, and was discharged \nof his dischargeable debts in July 2018. (GE 7) Concerning his current financial \nsituation, Applicant testified he is making $82,000 yearly. His monthly take-home pay is \nabout $3,000.  \n \nApplicant testified that he reaffirmed his mortgage debt and has been making his \nmortgage payments. He submitted a checking account statement showing he paid \n$1,969 in February, March and April 2018; made two payments of $1,969 in May 2018; \nmade payments in June and July 2018; skipped the August 2018 payment; made a \npayment in September 2018, and made two payments in October 2018. Applicant also \ntestified that he reaffirmed his car loan after the bankruptcy. He presented a receipt \nfrom November 2018, showing he paid $260 to a credit union, and that the next \npayment would be due in December 2018. (AE 1)  \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his financial problems. He claimed to recognize \nthe many financial mistakes he made, although he does not regret some of the \nexpenses incurred such as buying the new home, the new furniture, and the fertility \nmedical testing. He testified that he and his wife no longer use credit cards, and only \npurchase necessities with cash. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. He had financial \nproblems before 2012, and took a loan to consolidate his debts. In 2012, he purchased \na home above his financial means and incurred an extensive debt furnishing the house. \nHe took another loan to buy a car in 2013. Applicant then took a $50,000 loan in 2016, \nseeking to pay his delinquent loans, consolidate his debts, and finish his home \nbasement. He speculated that the anticipated higher value of the house with a finished \nbasement would allow him to refinance the house at a higher price. He would then use \nsome of his refinancing money to pay his prior $50,000 loan. However, his mortgage \nbecame delinquent for 30 days and he was disqualified from refinancing the house. \n \nApplicant\u2019s income was insufficient to pay for his living expenses and \naccumulated debts. He maxed out his credit cards paying for his living expenses and \nother discretionary expenses. He was unable to pay his debts and they became \ndelinquent. He notified his facility security officer of his financial problems in December \n2017, and he filed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2018. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.1  \n                                            \n1 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nNone of the financial considerations mitigating conditions are fully raised by the \nfacts in this case and they do not mitigate the security concerns. Notwithstanding his \nrecent bankruptcy discharge, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and ongoing.  \n \n \nApplicant reaffirmed three loans following his bankruptcy discharge. He \npresented evidence that he established a payment agreement with the mortgage \ncreditor and has been making monthly payments. His receipt for one payment to a \ncredit union is insufficient for me to conclude that Applicant has been making recurrent \npayments on his car loan. He presented no evidence to show that he established a \npayment agreement with the third loan creditor, or that he has been making recurrent \npayments on that loan. Moreover, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence of good-\nfaith efforts to pay his debts before his bankruptcy filing, or that he was financially \nresponsible under his circumstances.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because his medical problems, reduced earnings \nwhile in disability, and expenses associated with his daughter\u2019s braces, may be \nconsidered circumstances beyond his control. Notwithstanding, his evidence is \ninsufficient to show that he was financially responsible under the circumstances. On the \ncontrary, the evidence shows that Applicant has been living beyond his means, \nsupplementing his income with his credit cards, taking recurrent personal loans to pay \nhis credit debts, and ultimately reneging on his financial obligations. \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \ngood-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant received counseling as a result of his bankruptcy filing. However, his \nevidence is insufficient to show clear indications that his financial problems are resolved \nor under control. Applicant presented no evidence of contacts with creditors, payments \nmade, or of good-faith efforts to repay his creditors. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to demonstrate \nfinancial responsibility, or that his financial problems are being resolved. The financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant, 35, has been employed with federal contractors and has held a \nclearance since around 2007-2008. His evidence is insufficient to establish a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding \nan applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against \ngranting a security clearance. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns \nlead me to conclude that granting a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at \nthis time.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the \nfuture. With more effort towards documented resolution of his delinquent debts, a \nhealthy financial picture, and a track record of behavior consistent with his obligations, \nhe may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance \nworthiness.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",
