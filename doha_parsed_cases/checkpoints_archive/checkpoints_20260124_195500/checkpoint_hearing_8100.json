Applicant has had continued access to classified information from 1968 to March 2008 (Tr. 46-51). He received access to classified information at the secret level from around 1968 to 1978 while serving in the Air Force. From 1978 to 1990, he served in the Air National Guard where he also held access to classified information. In 1988, his secret access was upgraded to a top secret clearance, and that access continued until he retired from the service in 1990 (Tr. 48). Because of his employment for government contractors, Applicant also had access to classified information, through different government agencies, at the secret and top secret levels concurrent with his military access.

Marquez, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct. He falsified his security clearance application. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications on September 24, 2002 \n(Standard Form (SF) 86) (GE 1); August 5, 2003 (Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions) (GE 3); August 29, 2003 (SF 86) (GE 4); and September 6, 2006 \n(Questionnaire for National Security Positions) (GE 9). On July 30, 2008, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nthe Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nJanuary 14, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 28, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on October 31, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 5, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on November 24, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 14, \nwhich were received without objection (Tr. 25). Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted exhibits (AE) 1 and 2, which were received without objection. I kept the \nrecord open to allow Applicant time to submit additional matters in support of his case. \nHe submitted AE 3 post-hearing. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nDecember 2, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, \n1.j, and 1.k (some with explanations). He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through \n1.i, and 2.a. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, including his demeanor \nand testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old contracts manager (Tr. 45). He completed his \nassociate\u2019s degree in 1976, and has taken additional college courses over the years (Tr. \n45). He served honorably in the U.S. Air Force (10 years) and his state\u2019s Air National \nGuard from 1968 to 1990. He retired at the rank of E-7 from the Air National Guard (Tr. \n47).  \n \nApplicant has had continued access to classified information from 1968 to March \n2008 (Tr. 46-51). He received access to classified information at the secret level from \naround 1968 to 1978 while serving in the Air Force. From 1978 to 1990, he served in \nthe Air National Guard where he also held access to classified information. In 1988, his \nsecret access was upgraded to a top secret clearance, and that access continued until \nhe retired from the service in 1990 (Tr. 48). Because of his employment for government \ncontractors, Applicant also had access to classified information, through different \ngovernment agencies, at the secret and top secret levels concurrent with his military \naccess.  \n \nIn August 2002, he was hired by his current employer, a government contractor. \nHis supervisor over the past six years considers Applicant to be extremely reliable and \nhonest. In his opinion, Applicant has demonstrated integrity and professionalism at \nwork, and earned the respect of co-workers and managers within the company. He \nconsiders Applicant to be trustworthy and recommended his continued access to \nclassified information (AE 2).  \n \nSince 1968, Applicant submitted many security clearance applications, both for \nhis military and civilian job positions (Tr. 64). He was very familiar with the security \n \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nclearance application process. His Department of Defense access to classified \ninformation was suspended in March 2008 as a result of a decision by another \ngovernment agency to deny his access to sensitive compartmented information \n(Appellate Exhibit 1). \n \nApplicant married his first wife in 1971 and they were divorced in 1979. He \nmarried his current wife in April 1980 (Tr. 83). He has three grown children: two \ndaughters ages 27 and 20, and a son age 25 (Tr. 52). \n \nApplicant testified he started gambling around 1996-1997 (Tr. 54). In 1998, his \npast time became an addiction and he developed into a compulsive gambler. His \nearnings and credit cards were not sufficient to support his gambling habit (Tr. 54-55). \nIn 1999, Applicant became the treasurer of a large sports club. Between 1999 and \nSeptember 2003, Applicant embezzled $114,000 from his club to support his extensive \ngambling habit and expenses (Tr. 56). In September 2003, he disclosed his \nembezzlement to the club\u2019s attorney. Shortly thereafter, Applicant made an equity loan \nand borrowed money from relatives to make three lump sum payments to the club \ntotaling $75,000 (Tr. 34, 60). In March 2004, Applicant signed a promissory note \nagreeing to pay the remaining $39,000. He paid the money ahead of schedule and his \npromissory note was released in January 2006 (GE 14, Tr. 36, 58-61). Applicant \ndisclosed his gambling problems to his wife and close family members. \n \nBecause of his remorse and guilt over his gambling habit and embezzlement, \nApplicant became depressed. He was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, \nSingle Episode, Severe Without Psychotic Features (AE 3). He underwent professional \npsychological counseling/treatment from October 2003 to April 2005 and received anti-\ndepression medication (Tr. 38-41). His depression is currently under control and he no \nlonger takes medications. At his hearing, Applicant described himself as a recovering \ncompulsive gambler, but averred he no longer has the urge to gamble (Tr. 42). On July \n12, 2005, during a security clearance interview conducted by another government \nagency, Applicant stated that his then gambling activity was limited to a scratch off ticket \nper month (GE 5). \n \nApplicant has been regularly attending Gambler\u2019s Anonymous (GA) since \nOctober 2003 to the day of his hearing. He has actively participated in GA\u2019s activities, \nand has held positions of responsibility in the local GA group, including service as \nsecretary and twice as treasurer. He also served as treasurer for the state organization \nthat oversees and guides all GA\u2019s groups within his state (Tr. 42-44). According to the \nChairman of his state\u2019s Intergroup of Gamblers Anonymous, Applicant has earned the \nrespect and trust of his peers with his excellent performance, work ethics, and \ndependability. He has achieved outstanding improvements in his character and \ncommitment to excellence (AE 1). \n \nApplicant smoked marijuana in late 2002 at the age of 52 (Tr. 40-41). He \nexplained that he and a group of co-workers who like to play musical instruments got \ntogether to play music around the 2002 Christmas Holidays. During the evening, a co-\n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nworker lit a marijuana cigarette that was circulated around the group. Applicant smoked \nand passed the marijuana cigarette around his circle of friends several times (GEs 6 \nand 11).  \n \nApplicant claimed that his last use of marijuana was in 2002 (Tr. 62-63). Prior to \n2002, his last use of marijuana was in 1987. Applicant knew that marijuana is a \ncontrolled substance, and that possession and use of marijuana is illegal. Both times \nApplicant used marijuana he had access to classified information. \n \nIn September 2002, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (GE 1). \nIn response to question 28 (asking whether he had ever illegally used a controlled \nsubstance while possessing a security clearance), Applicant deliberately answered \u201cNo\u201d \nand failed to disclose his 1987 marijuana and cocaine use.2 \n \nOn August 5 and 29 of 2003, Applicant submitted two additional security \nclearance applications (GEs 3 and 4). In response to questions 24.a of the August 5, \n2003 SF 86, and question 27 of the August 29, 2003 SF 86 (both asking whether in the \nlast seven years he had illegally used any controlled substance), Applicant deliberately \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose his 2002 marijuana use.3 In his response to \nquestion 24.b of the August 5, 2003 SF 86, and question 28 of the August 29, 2003 SF \n86 (both asking whether he had ever illegally used a controlled substance while \npossessing a security clearance), Applicant deliberately answered \u201cNo\u201d and failed to \ndisclose his 1987 cocaine use and his 2002 marijuana use. \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant submitted a fourth security clearance application \n(GE 9). In response to questions 24.a (asking whether in the last seven years he had \nillegally used any controlled substance), Applicant answered \u201cYes;\u201d however, he failed \nto disclose the month/year, drug used, and the number of times used. In his response to \nquestion 24.b (asking whether he had ever illegally used a controlled substance while \npossessing a security clearance), Applicant deliberately answered \u201cNo\u201d and failed to \ndisclose his 1987 cocaine use and his 2002 marijuana use. \n \nApplicant claimed his failure to disclose his marijuana use in his August 29, 2003 \nSF 86 was not deliberate or with the intent to mislead the government. He explained the \n \n2  On July 2, 2004, during a security clearance interview conducted by another government \nagency, Applicant provided the following information concerning his past use of illegal drugs: in 2002 he \nused marijuana at a friend\u2019s house; in 1987 he snorted cocaine; between 1978 and 1979, he used \nmarijuana twice while in the Air National Guard; between 1972 and 1974, while serving in the Air Force, \nhe used marijuana on two separate occasions while holding a security clearance; between 1969 and \n1972, while serving in the Air Force (stationed in Germany) and holding a secret clearance, he used \nhashish one time per week. He contributed money to the purchase of hashish, and purchased hashish \nhimself twice (GEs 5 and 13). Applicant failed to disclose this information in his subsequent security \nclearance applications.  \n \n3  His falsification of the August 29, 2003 SF 86, is the only falsification alleged in the SOR \nconcerning Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use or drug activity. Specifically, SOR \u00b6 1.f only lists his failure to \ndisclose his 2002 marijuana use. All other falsification allegations concern his alleged failure to disclose \nfinancial information. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nhe did not recall his past use of marijuana when he submitted his SF 86 (Tr. 68). At the \ntime, he was suffering from depression and taking anti-depression medication (Tr. 37-\n41). He further explained: \u201cIt was to me such a simple casual thing in the setting that I \nwas in. I more than likely didn\u2019t even think of it\u201d (Tr. 66). \n \nIn his answers to the four SF 86 financial questions concerning financial \ndelinquencies (asking whether during the last seven years he had been over 180 days \ndelinquent on any debts, and whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any \ndebts), Applicant did not disclose his $114,000 embezzlement debt. Applicant admitted \nthat he embezzled the money and owed the debt, but that he was never delinquent on \nhis repayments to the club. The SOR did not allege any other delinquent debts that the \nApplicant failed to disclose. \n \nApplicant was denied eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented \ninformation by two other government agencies in 2005 and 2007. Both denials were \nbased, in part, on the same questionable behavior alleged in the pending SOR.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.4 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d5 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n \n4  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n5  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. AG \u00b6 15.  \n \nBetween 1997 and September 2003, Applicant developed into a compulsive \ngambler and embezzled $114,000 from a club in which he held a position of trust. He \nstole the money to support his extensive gambling habit and expenses. He continued \ngambling (playing scratch off tickets) until at least January 2005.  \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified his August 29, 2003 security clearance application \nwhen he failed to disclose his 2002 marijuana use. \n \nApplicant claimed his falsification of the August 29, 2003 was not deliberate or \nwith the intent to mislead the government. He claimed he did not recall his 2002 use of \nmarijuana when he submitted his SF 86. He explained that at the time, he was suffering \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nfrom depression and taking medications. Considering Applicant\u2019s testimony in light of \nextensive and detailed record evidence, I find his testimony was less than candid.  \n \nApplicant falsified his September 2002 security clearance application6 when he \nfailed to disclose that his 1987 marijuana and cocaine use while possessing a security \nclearance. He falsified his August 5, 2003 security clearance application when he failed \nto disclose that within the last seven years (in 2002) he had illegally used marijuana. He \nalso falsified his answers to question 24.b of the August 5, 2003 SF 86, and question 28 \nof the August 29, 2003 SF 86 (both asking whether he had ever illegally used a \ncontrolled substance while possessing a security clearance), when he deliberately \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose his 1987 cocaine use, and his 2002 marijuana use. \n \nHe further falsified his September 2006 security clearance application when he \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to question 24.b (asking whether he had ever illegally used a controlled \nsubstance while possessing a security clearance), and deliberately failed to disclose his \n1987 cocaine use, and his 2002 marijuana use. \n \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, I am convinced Applicant deliberately failed \nto disclose the information. Numerous factors weighed in my analysis to reach that \nconclusion, including: Applicant\u2019s statements to other government agencies, his maturity \n(both at the time of the illegal drug use and when he submitted his security clearance \napplications), his service and employment history, his demeanor and testimony, and the \nlack of credibility of his explanations.  \n \nBecause of his extensive experience in the Air Force, the Air National Guard, \nholding a security clearance, and with the security clearance process, Applicant knew \nthe importance of accurately completing his security clearance application and telling \nthe truth. Nevertheless, he failed to provide information that was material to making an \ninformed security decision and made false statements. AG \u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire,\u201d applies. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e and 1.g \u2013 1.i, alleged Applicant falsified his September 24, 2002, \nAugust 29, 2003, and September 6, 2006 security clearance applications, because he \nfailed to list his $114,000 embezzlement debt in his answers to the three SF 86 financial \nquestions concerning financial delinquencies. In its pertinent parts, the financial \nquestions asked whether during the last seven years Applicant had been over 180 days \ndelinquent on any debts, and whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any \n \n6  The Government did not allege the falsifications of the questions concerning Applicant\u2019s use of \nillegal drugs and drug activity in his security clearance applications from September 2 and September 24, \n2002, August 5, 2003, and September 6, 2006. Thus, the falsification of these security clearance \napplications cannot be used as grounds to deny Applicant\u2019s application under Guideline E. However, I am \nrequired to consider Applicant\u2019s overall questionable behavior when evaluating the seriousness of the \nconduct alleged in the SOR to determine factors such as the extent to which his behavior is recent; the \nlikelihood of recurrence; his credibility, i.e., Applicant\u2019s explanations concerning the circumstances of the \nincidents alleged; and his rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndebt. The Government\u2019s evidence failed to establish Applicant was ever late or \ndelinquent on his payments. \n \nApplicant stole the $114,000 and acquired a legal obligation to return the money. \nAfter confessing his embezzlement, Applicant shortly thereafter paid $75,000 in three \nlump sum payments and signed a promissory note for the remainder of the debt, which \nhe timely paid. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns. After considering all the mitigating conditions, I find none of the mitigating \nconditions apply to this case. Applicant\u2019s behavior shows a recurrent pattern of \nfalsifications (AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply). His falsification of the security clearance \napplication is a serious offense, his behavior is recent, and it shows Applicant\u2019s lack of \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. (AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply). \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an Applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant\u2019s compulsive gambling habit led him to embezzle $114,000 from a club \nin which he held a position of trust. He stole the money to support his extensive \ngambling habit and expenses. He continued gambling (playing scratch off tickets) until \nat least January 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior triggers the applicability of the following disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, \nfiling deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches \nof trust; \n \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling \nproblems, or other issues of security concern; and \n \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful \nattempt to stop gambling, \"chasing losses\" (i.e. increasing the bets or \nreturning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of gambling \nlosses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay gambling debts, family \nconflict or other problems caused by gambling. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nI find Applicant\u2019s questionable behavior to be relatively recent. He gambled from \n1997 to at least 2005, and his embezzlement took place from around 1998 to 2003, \nthus, it was not infrequent.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s GA sponsor and psychologist believe he is doing well, and that he \novercame his depression and gambling habit. Notwithstanding, the record shows \nApplicant gambled at least until 2005. Because Applicant was diagnosed as a \ncompulsive gambler and he has continued to gamble until at least 2005 (albeit by \npurchasing scratch off tickets), I am not convinced that the circumstances that led to his \ngambling habit and embezzlement are not likely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (c) do not \napply.  AG \u00b6 20 (d) applies because Applicant took immediate action to repay his \nobligation. However, financial considerations remain a security concern because his \nfinancial concerns are directly linked to his compulsive gambling habit. Applicant has \ncontinued gambling at least until 2005. As such, I consider his behavior recent, likely to \nrecur, and it cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n10 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, educated, and \nwell trained man. He honorably served 22 years in the Air Force and Air National Guard, \nand has been successful working for numerous defense contractors for many years. He \nhas held access to classified information at the secret and top secret level for \napproximately 40 years.  \n \nBecause of his years in the service and his many years holding access to \nclassified information, Applicant knew or should have known the importance of the trust \nplaced on him by the Government. He used illegal drugs in numerous occasions while \nholding access to classified information and violated the trust placed on him when he \nembezzled money to support his extensive gambling habit. Moreover, he failed to be \ncandid and honest on his security clearance application and during his testimony at \nhearing. His behavior shows he lacks judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and personal \nconduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c, and 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, 1.g - 1.k : \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

On July 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline J. The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 22, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing through counsel on August 22, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nMarch 16, 2009\n\nGE 1; AE A; AE B; Tr. 20-22, 59-76.\n1\nGE 1; Tr. 20, 44, 78.\n2\n2\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on August 28, 2008. On October 20,\n2008, DOHA amended the SOR to add additional security concerns under Guideline G.\nApplicant answered the amended SOR through counsel on November 4, 2008.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 20, 2008, and I received\nthe case assignment on November 24, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nDecember 15, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 13, 2009.\nThe government offered four exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received and\nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and four witnesses testified on his\nbehalf. He submitted two exhibits (AE) A and B, which were received and admitted into\nevidence without objection. The record closed on January 13, 2009. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 26, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on December 31, 2008. (Tr. 10.) I advised\nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the\nhearing. After consulting with counsel, Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days\nnotice. (Tr. 10.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 22, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m of the SOR, with explanations. He admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.e of the Amended SOR. He also provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 40 years old, works as senior field technician for a Department\nof Defense contractor. He began his job two years ago and his employer promoted him\nin August 2008 to the position of installation coordinator. Applicant, a mechanical\nperson, installs information technology and communication networks. His current\nemployer describes his work performance as consistently excellent. His supervisor\nrated him outstanding in August 2008. His work attendance is very good. Former co-\nworkers also describe him as an excellent worker and some one who came to work\nevery day.1\nApplicant married his first wife in 1992. They divorced in 1996. They have a\ndaughter who is now 16 years old. Subsequent to his divorce, Applicant met a woman\nwith whom he lived between 1997 until 2000. He married his second wife a few days\nbefore the hearing. They lived together for five years prior to their marriage.2\n\nTr. 37-38.\n3\nGE 3.\n4\nGE 3; Tr. 38.\n5\nGE 2; GE 4; Tr. 39-40.\n6\n3\nIn October 1994, the police arrested and charged Applicant with domestic assault\nand battery after he pushed his first wife out of bed. Applicant denies that alcohol was\ninvolved in this incident. The court found him guilty. The record contains no evidence\nwhich indicates the sentence imposed by the court.3\nOn January 29, 1995, the police charged Applicant with driving under the\ninfluence (DUI) and hit and run. Following a trial before a judge, the court found\nApplicant guilty of DUI, fined him $250 and assessed $68 in costs, which Applicant paid.\nThe court, however, dismissed the hit and run charge.4\nIn 1995, Applicant and his wife separated. They argued over custody of their\ndaughter on the phone one evening. The argument led to Applicant\u2019s arrest in April\n1995 for threatening, profane and abusive language over the telephone. Emotions, not\nalcohol, controlled this situation. The court found Applicant guilty of this offense,\nsentenced him to 30 days in jail, suspended, and fined him $250. Appellant had no\nother incidents with his first wife.5\nApplicant started dating a woman (P) in 1997. They moved in together, but did\nnot marry. They often drank then argued with each other. Their arguing escalated into\nmutual physical combat and to police calls. Several arrests occurred because of these\nfights. In January 1998, the police arrested Applicant for the first time for felonious\nassault. The court dismissed this charge a few weeks later. In a February 1998\nargument,  P threw a brick through Applicant\u2019s car window and hit him over the head\nwith a golf club. Applicant broke the golf club then hit P with it. The police arrested and\ncharged Applicant with assault and battery on a family member after this fight. He\ndeclined to file charges against P. The court found him guilty, fined him and sentenced\nhim to 12 months in jail, which was suspended except for 10 days. Applicant served his\nsentence through a weekend work release program, doing community service. The\npolice arrested and charged him with violation of probation in May 1998. The court\ndismissed this charge in September 1998. The record contains little information on\nthese 1998 incidents between Applicant and P.6\nIn October 1999, the police again arrested and charged Applicant with assault\nand battery on a family member, P. Applicant does not remember the October 1999\narrest, but acknowledges that it is listed on his arrest report. This arrest case was nol\nprossed at court. In February 2000, the police again arrested and charged Applicant\nwith felony assault and battery on a family member following yet another fight with P.\n\nApplicant believed that the October 1999 arrest and the January 2000 arrest were the same incident. The\n7\ncourt record indicates that his February 8, 2000 arrest is for an incident on January 22, 2000. GE 3 at 5.\nGE 2; GE 3, GE 4; Tr. 40-44.\n8\nGE 2; GE 3; GE 4; Tr. 44.\n9\nGE 2; GE 3; Tr. 44-46.\n10\n4\nThe court record indicates that the incident occurred on January 22, 2000.  I find that\n7\nthe February 8, 2008 arrest and the listed January 22, 2000 arrest are for the same\nincident based on the court record. In August 2000, Applicant pled guilty to the felony\nassault charge. The court sentenced him to three years in jail and suspended the\nsentence. Applicant paid court costs of $348. Following his arrest in February 2000,\nApplicant and P ended their relationship. He described this arrest as a \u201cwake up call\u201d for\nhim. Applicant did not seek counseling in 2000 because \u201che was too stubborn to believe\nhe needed it for himself\u201d. He thought P needed counseling. He also did not believe he\nhad an alcohol problem.   \n8\nIn August 2000, the police charged Applicant with threatening calls to P, a\nmisdemeanor. Applicant appeared in court in November 2000 with tapes of the\ntelephone conversation. After hearing the tapes, the court dismissed the charges.\nApplicant has not been involved with P since 2000. He has not been arrested for assault\nand battery since February 2000.9\nApplicant joined a local Moose lodge in 2003. On April 17, 2003, the Moose\nLodge held its initiation ceremony. During the ceremony, Applicant drank four drinks in\ntwo hours. The drinks were stronger than he realized. He decided to drive home. The\npolice stopped him because he had not turned on his car headlights. The police\nconducted a field sobriety test and administered a breathalyzer test. As a result, the\npolice arrested and charged him with DUI, a misdemeanor. The court found him guilty of\nDUI, sentenced him to 20 days in jail, three years good behavior, three years\nunsupervised probation, restricted his driving privileges, and directed him to attend a\nstate alcohol and substance abuse program. He served his jail sentence on weekends,\npaid a fine, and completed the alcohol program.   \n10\nBecause his second DUI occurred less than three years after his sentence in\nAugust 2000 for assault and battery, the State filed a felony violation of probation\ncharge against Applicant in August 2003 and the court issued a warrant for his arrest.\nWhen he learned that the arrest warrant existed, Applicant presented himself to the\npolice on June 17, 2004, where he was arrested. Applicant pled guilty to the violation of\nprobation charge. The court placed him on good behavior for three years, ordered him\ninto an alcohol treatment program, assigned a probation officer, and ordered him to\nattend domestic violence and anger management counseling. He completed the\nrequired alcohol treatment and domestic violence and anger management counseling.\nHe recalls that his counselor prepared a final report, but he does not know the contents\n\nGE 2; GE 3; Tr. 47-49.\n11\nGE 1; GE 4; Tr. 49-50.\n12\nTr. 24-27, 34-35, 54-57, 61, 65, 72, 80-85.\n13\n5\nnor does he know what type of diagnosis, if any, was made. The record does not\ncontain this report.  \n11\nApplicant began living with his current wife in 2003. In June 2006, they argued.\nWhen she asked him to leave the house, he refused. Although no physical violence was\ninvolved, she felt threatened and called the police. The police arrested him and charged\nhim with disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace, a misdemeanor. He spent five\ndays in jail. His wife later dropped the charges and the court dismissed the case. After\nhis arrest and detention, he called his employer and advised his employer that he was\nin jail. His employer discharged him from his job when learning of his arrest. He\nacknowledges that alcohol was involved in this incident.12\nApplicant began drinking occasionally at age 12 and seriously at age 21, when\nhe joined the United States Navy. He drank to excess and often. He acknowledges that\nhe is an alcoholic, but denies he is alcohol dependent. During his alcohol treatment\nprogram in 2005, he did not drink. He describes this treatment program as \u201ceffective\u201d.\nHe returned to drinking after he completed treatment, but consumed alcohol at much\nlower levels than in the past. Applicant drank four beers on October 31, 2008 and one\nbeer on November 2, 2008 while watching a football game. He has not consumed\nalcohol since this date and does not plan to drink alcohol in the future. He believes it is\nin his best interest not to drink. His wife rarely drinks and confirms his abstinence. She\nalso stated that he no longer associates with his drinking buddies and was never\nphysically violent with her. He plans on contacting his counselor again. His co-workers\nstated that he never observed any problems with his work performance and attendance.\nHis wife describes a 100% improvement in him since 2006. He has a better outlook on\nlife and his values have changed.13\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n14\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE#.a.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing that its members have\nno opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should not give any\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of the administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations\n6\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n14\n\nand ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes\nwitness credibility determinations.

Aug. 25,\n2006)(Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to reverse hearing-level\njudicial decisions and recommending remand of cases to resolve material, prejudicial error) and ISCR Case\nNo. 07-03307 (App. Bd. Sept. 29, 2008). Compliance with the Agency\u2019s rules and regulations is required. See\nUnited States ex. rel. Acardi  v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Lopez v. FAA, 318 F.3d 242, 247-\n248 (D.C. Cir 2003); Nickelson  v. United States, 284 F. Supp.2d 387, 390 (E.D. Va. 2003)( explaining\nstandard of review).\n7\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct\nParagraph 30 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to criminal conduct: ACriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.@\nUnder AG \u00b6 31, the following conditions could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying:\n31(a) provides that Aa single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses@\nmay be disqualifying;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and\n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated\nrehabilitation program.\n \n\n8\nAppellant admits the police charged him with assault and battery on a family\nmember five times, twice with alcohol-related driving offenses, twice with threatening\nconduct, once for disorderly conduct and twice for violation of probation. These offenses\nare either misdemeanor or felony crimes. The evidence establishes the above\ndisqualifying condition.\nThe adjudicative guidelines also set out some potentially mitigating conditions.\nUnder & 32, an Applicant may mitigate the security concerns by\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement;\nApplicant\u2019s criminal record reflects 11 years of conduct which resulted in\nnumerous arrests. His first assault and battery arrest occurred when he was married to\nhis first wife. They divorced in 1996. Thereafter, he entered into a relationship with P,\nwhich can best be described as toxic. They drank alcohol, argued, and engaged in\nphysical combat with each other. Their arguments led to four arrests for assault and\nbattery on a family member and two convictions, the last in August 2000. Applicant\nended this relationship in 2000 when he recognized how detrimental the problems were\nto him. He has not been arrested for assault and battery since 2000. The police twice\narrested and charged him with abusive and threatening telephone calls, the last in\nAugust 2000. The court convicted him of this conduct in 1995, but based on his\nevidence, dismissed the charges in 2000. He has not been arrested for threatening\ntelephone calls since 2000. Given the length of time since his abusive physical conduct\nlast occurred and the fact that he ended his relationship with P, there is little likelihood\nthis type of conduct will occur in the future.\nApplicant\u2019s last DUI arrest occurred in 2003. This arrest resulted in a 2004 finding\nby the court that he violated his probation for his 2000 assault and battery conviction.\nSince 2004, he has not been convicted of another crime, although he was arrested once\nfor disorderly conduct in 2006. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct and behavior leading to his\narrests has changed significantly in the last five years.  Several of the offenses for which\nhe was arrested were dismissed by the court after hearing. I infer from the court findings\nthat evidence showed that Applicant either did not commit the offense for which he was\ncharged or there was insufficient evidence to show he committed these offenses.\n\n9\nBecause alcohol played a significant role in most of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct\nand he only recently stopped drinking, I find that it is too soon to conclude that his\nconduct has been successfully and fully rehabilitated even though his physical violence\nended in 2000. Applicant has established mitigation of his criminal conduct under AG \u00b6\u00b6\n32 (a) and (c).\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent;\nApplicant began drinking at age 12 and seriously drinking at age 21. He drank to\nexcess frequently. As a result, the court twice convicted him of DUI and assault and\nbattery on a family member. His second DUI arrest also resulted in a felony charge and\nconviction for violation of probation. The police arrested him on numerous occasions for\nconduct related to drinking between 1998 and 2006. Thus, these disqualifying\nconditions apply in this case.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n\n10\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and,\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant acknowledges that he is an alcoholic. He stopped drinking two months\nbefore his hearing, a fact confirmed by his new wife. However, because he stopped\ndrinking in 2005 then returned to drinking, this short time of no alcohol consumption is\ninsufficient to establish a pattern of abstinence. There is no evidence of record that he\nhas been diagnosed as alcohol dependent or an alcohol abuser by a professional. He\ndid enter and complete a court ordered alcohol treatment program in 2005. Whatever\ndiagnosis the counselor may have made at that time is not of record. What is known is\nthat he returned to drinking. The evidence of record is insufficient to establish mitigation\nunder AG \u00b6 23.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both good\nand bad. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record, not\na single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is shown. A determination of\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance should not be made as punishment for\n\n11\nspecific past conduct, but on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of\nrecord to decide if a nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security\nconcern.     \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s arrests and court\nconvictions are directly related to his excessive alcohol consumption. He recognized the\nnegative impact his relationship with P was having on him and terminated the\nrelationship. Since ending this relationship, he has not been arrested for assault and\nbattery. He, however, declined to acknowledge the role alcohol played in the problems\nwith this woman until very recently. Applicant continued to drink from 2000 until two\nmonths ago. His drinking resulted in a second DUI and a finding that he violated his\nprobation. He enrolled in court ordered treatment for alcohol, domestic violence, and\nanger, which he completed. Although he stopped drinking while in the program, which\nhe considers effective, he returned to drinking at a lower volume. In 2006, he had his\nlast arrest for an alcohol related incident, which is significant given his long history of\nalcohol related criminal arrests. His new wife does not tolerate abuse from him and\ncredibly presented a picture of a change man. However, his decision to stop drinking\ntwo months ago is too recent for him to show a track record of abstinence. Given that he\nacknowledges he is an alcoholic, his decision to not drink in the future is admirable as\nwell as difficult to honor. Had he abstained from drinking after his treatment in 2005, he\nwould have mitigated any security concerns about his alcohol consumption. Because of\nthe serious problems his alcohol consumption has caused, Applicant needs to show that\nhe can refrain from alcohol consumption over time to mitigate security concerns under\nGuideline G.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct, but he has\nnot mitigated security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on August 28,\n2007. On August 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial\nconsiderations (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken\npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on September 4, 2008. DOHA issued\na Notice of Hearing on November 5, 2008, and the hearing was held on November 19,\n2008. At the hearing, four exhibits (GE 1 through 4) were admitted in evidence without\nobjection to support the government\u2019s case. Applicant testified and placed exhibits AE A\nthrough AE C in evidence. In the time allowed for Applicant to submit additional\nFebruary 24, 2009\n\n SOR 1.h. is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n1\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\ndocumentation following the hearing, he submitted AE D through AE H without\nobjection. DOHA received copy of the transcript on December 2, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR lists seven delinquent debts totaling $13,962.00. SOR 1.h. is a\nduplicate entry of SOR 1.c.  Applicant admitted all debts except for 1.f., which he\n1\nindicated he settled in May 2008. The second guideline (paragraph 2, personal conduct)\nlists two allegations that Applicant admitted. Applicant is 53 years old, single, and has\nbeen employed as a mail room clerk, scheduler for video teleconferences, and back-up\nreceptionist, with his employer since May 2001. \nFinancial Considerations\nIn January 2001, Applicant was laid off by a travel agency, and was unemployed\nuntil March 2001, when he was assigned by a temporary employment agency to work at\nhis current employer. In May 2001, Applicant was hired full time by his current\nemployer. Applicant indicated he was making payments on the delinquent accounts, but\nnot minimum payments, and the creditors contacted him (GE 2; Tr. 28), pressing him for\nthe minimum payment. He claims he responded to the creditors, but either got no reply\nfrom them, or they refused to negotiate with him (Tr. 31). Initially Applicant did not pay\nthe SOR 1.c. or SOR 1.e. creditors because they told him to wait to be contacted by the\ncollection agencies (Tr. 29). Later in his testimony, Applicant stated that because the\ncollection agencies did not contact him in the first year of the debts\u2019 delinquency, he did\nbelieve the debts were a real priority (Tr. 49). Most of the accounts listed in the SOR\nbecame delinquent in 2001 and 2002, however, one credit card account fell delinquent\nin August 2000.\nIn September 2007, Applicant had a heart attack. He was treated at the hospital\nfrom September 9 through September 11, 2007, and advised he could return to work in\n14 to 21 days (GE 2). During his cardiac recovery from September through November\n2007, Applicant decided to put his health before his overdue debts. He also decided to\npay his medical bills before his delinquent accounts, but is willing to pay both old and\nnew accounts (Id.)\nSOR 1.a. $4,768.00. This credit card account became delinquent in November\n2000 (GE 3). Applicant believes that the collection agency that handles this debt\ncontacted him in October 2007. He began making payments of $52.00 a month on this\naccount in August 2008, and is still making the monthly payment (GE 2, AE H). The\npresent past due amount is $1095.00 (AE H). Applicant\u2019s documented monthly payment\nfor about a year supports a finding in his favor regarding this account.  \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nSOR 1.b. $3,602.00. This account fell delinquent in July 2003, and has not been\npaid. This account is resolved against Applicant.\nSOR 1.c. $1,857.00. (This is the same account as SOR 1.h.) The last activity on\nthis account was October 2001. A finding against Applicant is based on his lack of\naction to address this debt.\nSOR 1.d. $90.00. Applicant stated this medical debt (and the medical company\nthat provided the service) was purchased by the hospital that treated him for his heart\nattack (Tr. 47). With no evidence of payment, this debt is resolved against Applicant.\nSOR 1.e. $408.00. This is a department store account that became delinquent in\nOctober 2002, and has not been paid. Applicant remains responsible for this account. \nSOR 1.f. $1,090.00. Applicant believes he was contacted by a collection agency\nfor SOR 1.f. in January 2008, though he has no proof. The collection agency demanded\n$1,090.00, and SOR 1.f. posts the same delinquent amount. He settled the debt for\n$852.00 by making a $300.00-dollar lump sum payment in February 2008, and three\nmonthly payments of $184.00 between March and May 2008 (GE 2). Having no other\ninformation to determine whether SOR 1.f. is the same account, as identified by the\ncollection agency, I find that Applicant settled the account, although there is no\ndocumentation of monthly payments for April and May 2008. Since Applicant submitted\nthe response to interrogatories on May 21, 2008, the May payment may not have been\nprocessed in time for Applicant to include the payment in his response to the\ninterrogatories. While he had ample time to submit the April payment, I find that\nApplicant nonetheless settled this account. \nSOR 1.g. $1,517.00. This account became delinquent in October 2002. No action\nhas been taken on this account. AE G is a contact notice from a collection agency dated\nNovember 7, 2008. This account is resolved against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nOn June 21, 2006, Applicant intentionally provided false information about his\ndelinquent debts in his security clearance application (SCA). On the form, he answered\n\u201cNo\u201d to question 28.a. requiring information about debts over 180 days old in the last\nseven years. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 28.b., requiring information about\nwhether an applicant is over 90 days delinquent on any debt. \nOn November 30, 2004, Applicant provided an earlier SCA (AE A). In that SCA,\nhe answered \u201cNo\u201d to having debts over 180 days delinquent, but answered \u201cYes\u201d to\nhaving debts over 90 days delinquent. Applicant then listed one debt. In late November\n2005, Applicant filled out a new SCA that was lost by an organization that contracted to\nadminister security forms. This company lost the contract and was replaced by a new\ncompany to administer the security forms. In GE 1, Applicant\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d answers to\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nquestions 28a. and 28.b. of the June 21, 2006 SCA (SOR 2.a. and 2.b.) were triggered\nby frustration rather than an attempt to misrepresent himself on the security form. He\nknew he had debts, but he could not respond with details. \nAt the hearing, Applicant Provided more information about not being able to\nprovide the details of his indebtedness. He claimed he sought advice from his employer\nand the military office (location of his employment) while he was beginning to complete\nthe SCA (SOR 2.a. and 2.b). There was no place on the form for additional comments,\nand no one had a contact number for the organization that administered the SCA (Tr.\n24-25). Applicant was unofficially told that since he could not provide detailed\ninformation, answering \u201cNo\u201d to the financial questions would get the SCA into the\nsystem. Applicant then stated:\nI was not - - the way it was presented was that - - unfortunately, it was all\nunofficially told to me; said this. But that it was that since I couldn\u2019t provide\nthe answers immediately, that by saying no, it would get the form into the\nsystem without a hiccup. That then the process through of figuring out or\nbeing investigated or gone through, when they came to that about the\nfinancial things, that if they chose to question information about that, that\nthen they would come and ask me what (Tr. 35-36).\nApplicant has never had financial counseling. In 2001, he investigated debt\ncounseling but discovered it was too expensive (Tr. 33). He also checked into financial\ncounseling through his employer, but has pursued no counseling since his heart attack\nin September 2007. Applicant has never obtained a copy of his credit report (Tr. 34).\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant submitted his performance reviews for October 2001 through\nSeptember 30, 2007, which indicate he has met or exceeded his performance\nrequirements (AE D). The security force/protection officer has known Applicant since\n2004, and has observed him comply with all security regulations (AE E). The chief of\ninformation management, has known Applicant since 2001 when he recommended\nApplicant be hired (AE F). The chief knows that Applicant\u2019s hard-work and team player\nattitude has earned him additional responsibilities (Id.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\nThough most of Applicant accounts fell delinquent in 2001, GE 3 reflects that at\nleast one of the debts fell delinquent in late 2000. Applicant says he made payments to\nseveral of the creditors in 2001 until the creditors contacted him with demands for at\nleast the minimum payment. Even if he had made the payments, he still exercised poor\njudgment by accepting the creditors\u2019 advice to wait for the collection agencies to call\nhim, particularly during his uninterrupted employment between May 2001 and his heart\nattack in September 2007. Applicant has paid two creditors listed in the SOR, but still\nowes five creditors $7,474.00. FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply. \nThe mitigating conditions have been evaluated. FC mitigating condition (MC)\n20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies in part. Most of the\naccounts became delinquent over six years ago. However, the lack of evidence into\nApplicant\u2019s financial habits makes it impossible for me to conclude that his ongoing\nfinancial problems will not persist or deteriorate in the future. \nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control) receives no consideration. Though unanticipated\nunemployment is an event that is clearly outside a person\u2019s control, Applicant\u2019s job loss\noccurred more than six years ago, and lasted less than three months. The long period\nof undisturbed employment since his only documented job loss has provided him with\nadditional opportunities to address the overdue debts without having to worry about a\ndisruption of income. \nFC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control)\nreceives limited consideration based on Applicant\u2019s successful efforts in settling two of\nthe debts. Settling debts however, is only one area of financial responsibility that arises\nafter the debt has become delinquent. The most important area in the management of\nfinancial matters is to avoid getting entangled in financial problems by paying debts on\ntime, and instituting sound financial habits that eliminate the chances of future\nproblems. Applicant has not received counseling, and there is insufficient evidence to\nsupport a conclusion the debts will not recur.\nApplicant receives some consideration under FC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Though he did\nnot initiate the repayment of overdue creditors, he did negotiate a payment schedule\nwhich he honored throughout the repayment plan. However, additional weight cannot be\nassigned to Applicant\u2019s settlement of the two of seven creditors because of his\ndeliberate falsification of his SCA on June 21, 2006, and SCA in November 2004.\nHaving examined the record in its entirety, Applicant has not provided sufficient\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\nevidence that he has his debts under control. The FC guideline is found against\nApplicant.\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance\nprocess.\u201d \nGiven the fact that Applicant\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d answers to both debt questions (28.a., 28.b.)\nof his SCA in June 2006 were admittedly deliberate, PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission,\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire used to\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness) applies. \nPC MC 17.a. (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not\napply due to Applicant\u2019s failure to come forward with the intentional omission until\nAugust 2006, when he answered the allegations of intentionally omitting material\nfinancial information. \nPC MC 17.c. (the offense was so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment) is not applicable even though the intentional omission occurred more\nthan two years ago. The omission cannot be considered minor as Applicant tried to\nconceal his debts entirely with his \u201cNo\u201d answers to questions 28 and 29 of his SCA.\nSignificantly, in his SCA in November 2004, Applicant submitted false information about\nhis debts when he answered \u201cYes\u201d that he had debts, but then listed only one debt.  \nPC MC 17.d. (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) has only limited\napplication. While Applicant acknowledged that he deliberately omitted information from\nthe SCA, there is no evidence of action taken by Applicant to preclude the behavior\nfrom recurring in the future. Having weighed the adverse information under the PC\nguideline with the favorable information under the guideline, including the character\nevidence from Applicant\u2019s job, Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence is insufficient to find in his\nfavor under the PC guideline. \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence under the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of\nthe FC and PC guidelines. I have also weighed the circumstances of this case within the\ncontext of nine variables known as the whole person concept: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI have considered the facts of this case in light of the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions of the FC guideline, and also in light of the general factors of the whole\nperson concept. Applicant was 46 years old when he lost his job in early 2001. The\nunemployment was short because he found a full time job in May 2001, and has\nsustained continuing employment since that time. In 2001, Applicant knew he had\noverdue accounts because he remembered making some partial payments to the\ncreditors. He even acknowledged he had creditors in November 2004. \nSix years passed between Applicant\u2019s hire (May 2001) and the appearance of his\nmedical condition in September 2007. In that period, Applicant could have worked out a\npayment plan with some of the rising number of creditors. However, he decided to\naccept the advice of the creditors and wait on the collection agencies to contact him. He\nshould understand by now that his decision has caused him to fall deeper in debt.\nApplicant exercised good judgment in paying on or settling the SOR 1.a. and 1.f.\ncreditors. However, he is not really certain that those creditors are the same as the ones\nidentified in the SOR. Given the lack of evidence demonstrating initiative by Applicant to\nresolve his accounts with the remaining five creditors, I am unable to conclude he has\nhis finances under control. Applicant\u2019s two attempts to under report and then deny he\nhad debts altogether warrants a finding against Applicant under the FC and PC\nguidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n9\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was incarcerated in 1998 following his felony drug conviction for the\nmanufacture and delivery of LSD. After his parole ended in 2001, he continued to\nexhibit a disregard for the law by repeatedly operating a vehicle while his license was\nrevoked or suspended, and by using illegal drugs in 2004 and 2006. He lost a job in\n2002, due in part to his abuse of alcohol. He owes about $11,463 in delinquent debt that\nis only partially attributed to a motorcycle accident. Applicant\u2019s omission of arrest record\ninformation from his security clearance application was unintentional, but serious\nconcerns persist about his judgment and reliability. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on September 26, 2007. On June 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline J, criminal conduct; Guideline H, drug involvement;\nGuideline F, financial considerations; and Guideline E, personal conduct; which\nprovided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny him a security clearance and refer\nFebruary 17, 2010\n\n2\nthe matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nOn June 25, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and he requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on July 17, 2009, to decide whether it is clearly\nconsistent to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On August 11, 2009, I\nscheduled a hearing for September 17, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Seven government exhibits (Exs. 1-7) and\none Applicant exhibit (Ex. A) were admitted without any objections, and Applicant\ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on September 25, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline J, criminal conduct, that Applicant was charged in\nMay 1996 with operating to endanger (SOR 1.a); with operating after license revocation\nin about October 1996 (SOR 1.b) and in about 1998 (SOR 1.f); and with operating on a\nsuspended license in about December 1996 (SOR 1.c), and in about January 1997\n(SOR 1.d), all charges dismissed. Also under Guideline J, DOHA alleged that Applicant\nwas sentenced to eight years in prison for an October 1997 charge of manufacture or\ndelivery of LSD (SOR 1.e); was arrested in July 2002 for violating the Abuse Prevention\nAct (SOR 1.g); was convicted and placed on probation for operating after suspended\nlicense in 2003 (SOR 1.h); and pleaded guilty and paid restitution on charges of\noperating after suspended license, leaving the scene of property damage, and use\nwithout authority filed in January 2005 (SOR 1.i). \nUnder Guideline H, drug involvement, DOHA alleged that Applicant used cocaine\nfrom about February 2004 to at least August 2006 (SOR 2.a) and ecstasy from\nFebruary 2004 to at least August 2004 (SOR 2.b); that he \u201cmade\u201d and used LSD in at\nleast 1997 (SOR 2.c); and that he was sentenced to eight years in prison for the\nOctober 1997 charge of manufacturing or delivering LSD (SOR 2.d). \nUnder Guideline F, financial considerations, Applicant was alleged to owe\ndelinquent medical debt totaling $7,333 (SOR 3.a-3.c, 3.e-3.f) and two other debts in\ncollection totaling $4,130 (SOR 3.d, 3.g). \nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct, DOHA alleged that Applicant falsified a\nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (his e-QIP) by deliberately not disclosing\nthe charges filed against him in July 2002, 2003, and 2005 (SOR 4.a); that Applicant\nwas dismissed from his employment in about July 2002 for unsatisfactory performance\ndue in part to alcohol consumption (SOR 4.b); and that a civil restraining order was filed\nagainst him in about April 2002 (SOR 4.c).\n\nThe charge was disposed of as a civil infraction under Chapter 277, Section 70C (Ex. 6). Pertinent\n1\nstate law provides for a violation of a municipal ordinance, a bylaw, or a misdemeanor offense to be treated\nas a civil infraction not liable to punishment by incarceration. The court can, in such cases, impose a fine of\nnot more than $5,000. An adjudication of responsibility shall neither be used in the calculation of second and\nsubsequent offenses under any chapter, nor as the basis for the revocation of parole or of a probation\nsurrender. An adjudication of responsibility under this section may include an order of restitution. \n3\nApplicant admitted the criminal conduct allegations with the exception of 1.i,\nwhich he denied on the basis of a not guilty finding. He admitted the drug involvement\nand financial indebtedness. Concerning the personal conduct allegations, Applicant\nacknowledged he had not reported his most recent arrests on his e-QIP, but he had\nmisread the question and not intended to omit the information. Applicant admitted that\nhe had been dismissed from a job in 2002 in part due to alcohol, and that a civil\nrestraining order had been filed against him in 2002.  Concerning the restraining order,\nApplicant added, \u201cshe wanted to punch me for finding out she was cheating.\u201d\nAfter considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is 33 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor\nsince September 2007. He installs material to seal off radiation (\u201cpoly install\u201d) (Ex. A).\nHe seeks his first security clearance (Ex. 1).\nApplicant was ticketed for driving to endanger in May 1996. He and a friend in\nanother vehicle were observed swerving on the road. Applicant contended that he was\ntrying to avoid raised manhole covers in the roadway, but the judge was not persuaded\nby his explanation and he had to pay the ticket (Tr. 30).1\nApplicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was revoked for receiving multiple speeding tickets.\nHe was cited for driving on a revoked or suspended license in October 1996, December\n1996, January 1997, and May 1998 (Ex. 6). He admits that he drove without a valid\nlicense, but the charges were dismissed (Tr. 30-31).\nIn January 1997, Applicant began attending a technical institute located in\nanother state (Ex. 1). He was without a valid driver\u2019s license and unable to find a job\nnearby that would give him the income he needed to support himself. He had a\nroommate who \u201cknew a couple of things,\u201d and they began to  manufacture and distribute\nLSD early in the summer of 1997. Applicant, who occasionally smoked marijuana,\nbegan using LSD as well (Tr. 65). By October 1997, Applicant wanted to get out of the\ndrug business, and he planned to start fresh back home. Unbeknownst to him, the drug\nactivities of the Applicant and his roommate had been under investigation. In early\nOctober 1997, Applicant was caught with \u201c1,440 hits\u201d of mescaline (Tr. 32). He was\narrested and charged with manufacturing and distributing LSD or an analog, a class X\nfelony offense (Exs. 1, 2, 5, Tr. 32). \nIn late May 1998, Applicant pleaded guilty to the felony drug charge, and he was\nsentenced to eight years in prison. He was incarcerated initially in that state\u2019s\n\nConcerning his termination, Applicant testified, \u201cI was having a bad couple of years after the breakup\n2\nwith my fiancee and was trying to make myself feel a little better with the bottle and I lost my job over it. The\ndeal was he let me go, rather than fire me, that way I could collect unemployment and get some help with my\nalcohol problem\u201d (Tr. 40-41). \n4\npenitentiary, and then in a \u201cboot camp\u201d correctional facility for first time offenders with\nno violent crimes (Ex. 2, Tr. 32-33, 87-90). While he was in prison, he attended court\nordered Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings (Tr. 60). Applicant spent the final weeks\nof his incarceration in a halfway house pending processing of his paperwork, and he\nwas released on parole in late January 1999. He returned to his home state where he\nhad to report to a probation officer once a week until his parole ended in 2001 (Ex. 2, Tr.\n90-91).\nApplicant was employed by a woodworking company on his release from\nincarceration, and then he went to work as a technician for an auto dealer (Ex. 1).\nApplicant cohabited with a girlfriend from June to November 2001, until they broke up\nand Applicant moved out (Ex. 1). In April 2002, she obtained a civil restraining order\nagainst him (Ex. 6), although Applicant denies that he abused her (Ex. 2, Tr. 34). In\nearly July 2002, Applicant was charged criminally with violation of the state\u2019s Abuse\nPrevention Act (Ex. 6) when his former girlfriend apparently complained to the police\nthat he had violated the restraining order. Applicant denies that he called her (Ex. 2, Tr.\n35), and the charge was continued without a finding and then dismissed after he paid\ncourt costs (Ex. 6).\nApplicant enjoyed the freedom to come and go as he pleased, and over the June\nto July 2002 time frame, he drank beer at a bar after work on a daily basis. He left the\nbar usually before he had consumed too many drinks to drive safely, but he continued\nto drink at home until he fell asleep. Most nights he consumed close to 30 beers (Ex. 2),\nand he reported to his job the next day at times with a hangover or wearing sunglasses\n(presumably to cope with the effects of drinking). He eventually lost his job as an\nautomotive technician in July 2002, due to his drinking and unsatisfactory performance\n(Exs. 1, 2, Tr. 40-41).2\nApplicant began attending Alcohol Anonymous (AA) meetings with his ex-\ngirlfriend\u2019s father during the latter half of 2002. Applicant stopped attending AA meetings\nafter six months because he was feeling fine and he had reduced his alcohol\nconsumption to a couple beers with friends once a week (Tr. 60-61). He thought he\nmight have been a \u201cfunctional alcoholic\u201d over the month or so that he had been drinking\nto excess (Ex. 2).\nApplicant was unemployed for over a year, until about September 2003. When\nhis unemployment benefits ran out, he began working as a meat clerk for a supermarket\n(Tr. 51). A friend, who had started sleeping at his apartment, introduced him to the\n\u201cwrong crowd.\u201d From February 2004 to August 2004, Applicant snorted cocaine and\ningested ecstasy in pill form on the weekends when socializing with his new friends\n(Exs. 1, 2, Tr. 33, 64-65). Applicant told a government investigator in January 2008 that\nhe bought the cocaine and ecstasy at clubs (Ex. 2), but he clarified at his hearing that\n\nApplicant explained that by the court hearing, his female friend was eight months pregnant, and that\n3\nshe was going to be believed over him in spite of the truth (Tr. 37, 93).\n5\nhis friend purchased the drugs with money he gave him (Tr. 63-64). At Applicant\u2019s\nrequest, this friend eventually moved out, and Applicant ceased his illegal drug use (Tr.\n37-38).\nIn late October 2004, Applicant was out to a club with a female friend. He\nmaintains that he left the club with someone else, and that his companion, who had\nbeen drinking, left her car in the road following an accident (Ex. 2, Tr. 36-37). Yet she\ncalled the police and complained that he had taken her car without her permission (Tr.\n92). Applicant was arraigned in January 2005 on charges of operating after his license\nhad been suspended, leaving the scene of an accident with property damage, and use\nwithout authority. Applicant told a government investigator in January 2008 that he\npleaded guilty, paid a $3,500 fine, and his case was continued without a finding (Ex. 2).\nHe now claims that he pleaded no contest on legal advice.  Criminal records show that\n3\nin August 2005, he admitted sufficient facts to operating after license suspended,\nleaving the scene of property damage, and use of a motor vehicle without authority. He\nwas ordered to pay restitution of $2,515.88 to be paid within three months in three\ninstallments, and his case was continued without a finding for one year and then\ndismissed after payment of restitution and assessments (Exs. 6, 7).\nIn May or June 2005, Applicant was fired from his job at the supermarket (Exs. 1,\n2). Applicant had been suspended without pay for making a comment off the job about a\ncoworker. Applicant was terminated when he failed to show for scheduled work hours\n(Ex. 2).\nOver the next two years, Applicant worked as a kitchen manager at a restaurant\nand as a technician at an automobile body shop (Ex. 1). Following the death of a close\nfriend, he \u201cwent on a bender for the night\u201d and used cocaine while intoxicated at a\nhouse party in August 2006 (Exs. 1, 2, Tr. 33, 65, 67).\nIn September 2007, Applicant began working for his present employer (Ex. A).\nOn September 26, 2007, Applicant completed an e-QIP on which he disclosed his\nfelony drug conviction, and his use of ecstacy and cocaine on multiple occasions\nbetween February 2004 and August 2004, and cocaine once in August 2006 when he\nwas intoxicated. Applicant did not disclose that he had been charged with violation of\nthe Abuse Prevention Act in 2002, with operating after license suspended in 2003 and\n2005, and with leaving the scene of an accident with property damage in 2005, because\nhe believed only convictions had to be listed (Ex. 2, Tr. 40, 75). Applicant listed one\ndelinquent debt of $781.70 owed a utility company since June 2005 (SOR 3.g) (Ex. 1).\nAvailable credit reports (Exs. 3, 4) showed Applicant also owed delinquent\nmedical debts of $331 from September 2003 (SOR 3.f), $560 from February 2004 (SOR\n3.c), and $6,279 from March 2004 (SOR 3.e). In September 2007, a consumer credit\ncard debt of $2,218 was placed for collection (SOR 3.d). Applicant had fallen behind on\nthis credit card account in the past. He took out a loan and paid off the balance. After\n\nApplicant testified that he always paid his motorcycle loan on time (Tr. 48). As of May 2009, Equifax\n4\nwas reporting no past due balance but also that the account was 30 days past due as of March 2009 (Ex. 4).\n6\nthe card was reinstated, he again fell seriously behind in his payments and his account\nwent into collection (Tr. 43).\nAlthough he already possessed two trucks, for which he was paying insurance,\nApplicant was pressured by the woman he was dating into buying a new motorcycle in\nJuly 2008 (Tr. 49-50). He financed the purchase through a loan of $20,528, to be repaid\nat $365 per month (Ex. 4). Applicant has been current on those payments for the most\npart.4\n \nAs of May 2009, Applicant had not resolved the delinquent debt balances listed\nin the SOR. With interest continuing to accumulate, he owed $3,349 on the retail credit\ncard account in SOR 3.d, despite a claim of minor payments on the account in 2008 (Tr.\n43-44). Additional medical debt of $81 (SOR 3.a) and $82 (SOR 3.b) from May 2008\nhad been placed for collection (Ex. 4). \nApplicant was unable to repay his delinquent debts in part because of a\nmotorcycle accident in April 2008 (Tr. 38). Applicant was hit head on by a car who had\ncrossed into his lane. He suffered a fracture, and incurred orthopedic and physical\ntherapy costs that became his priority (Tr. 38-39, 57). After paying $750 in out-of-pocket\nmedical costs over the past year, he owes the physical therapist just under $300 and\nthe orthopedic surgeon about $360. He has ongoing prescription costs of about $10 per\nweek (Tr. 57-58). Applicant rejected an insurance settlement that would have covered\nhis medical expenses plus paid him $2,000 for his pain and suffering. He has not sought\nany legal help to negotiate with the insurance company (Tr. 59-60, 82). Applicant plans\nto use future settlement proceeds to pay off his delinquent debt (Tr. 83). \nIn September 2009, Applicant contacted the creditor of SOR 3.d and he\npromised to pay $75 per month on the debt starting in early October 2009 (Tr. 44).\nApplicant was one month behind on a credit card account that he opened in June 2009\nto rebuild his credit (Tr. 46-48), despite a reported \u201ccouple hundred bucks\u201d in\ndiscretionary income each month (Tr. 54) on an hourly wage of $21.84 (Ex. A).\nApplicant\u2019s income tax refund for tax year 2008 was $1,200 or $1,300. He spent about\n$800 of the refund on a camping vacation that he took with friends in June 2009 (Tr. 55-\n56).\n \nDuring an interview with a government investigator in January 2008, Applicant\nhad denied any current association with persons who use illegal drugs. He expressed\nan intent to refrain from illegal drug use in the future (Ex. 2). But at his hearing in\nSeptember 2009, Applicant admitted that at a couple of barbecues over the last few\nsummers, he had been at social gatherings of friends or family members (sister) where\nothers were smoking marijuana. Applicant elected not to smoke the drug himself and he\nwent outside (Tr. 68, 78). To Applicant\u2019s knowledge, his sister smokes marijuana once a\nweek or once a month. He has asked her to refrain from using marijuana in his\npresence (Tr. 79).\n\nThe available record contains no detail about the incident that led to the disciplinary action.\n5\n7\nApplicant consumes alcohol at party settings, such as family cookouts, when he\ndoes not have to work the next day. Since July 2002, he has consumed about 16 beers\nat a sitting once or twice a month, which for him is the minimum amount \u201cto even feel a\nbuzz\u201d (Ex. 2). As of September 2009, Applicant was sharing about 30 beers with a\nfriend once a month (Tr. 62, 84). At a pig roast in August 2009, Applicant drank 20\nbeers over the course of the entire day (from about 1000 hours to 2200 hours).\nApplicant rode his motorcycle home because he did not feel that he was intoxicated (Tr.\n83-84). Applicant does not think that he has a drinking problem (Tr. 63). Applicant has\nbeen ticketed for moving violations, including speeding, within the past two years,\nincluding in late August or early September 2009 (Tr. 58).\nApplicant\u2019s work performance with the defense contractor has been fully\nsatisfactory since he started in September 2007. He had one disciplinary incident\nbetween March 2008 and September 2008 that was discussed with his supervisor, but it\ndid not affect the quality of his work (Ex. A).5\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\n\n8\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct\nThe security concern about criminal conduct is set out in Guideline J, AG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe May 1996 charge of operating to endanger was disposed of as a civil\ninfraction. However, AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d\nand AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d apply because of\nApplicant\u2019s repeated operation of a motor vehicle after his driver\u2019s license had been\nsuspended or revoked, and because of his felony conviction, albeit dated, for\nmanufacture and distribution of LSD in 1997.\nApplicant served his sentence and his parole, apparently without incident. But\nafter he completed his parole, he violated the drug laws by abusing cocaine and ecstasy\nmultiple times in 2004 and by using cocaine at least once in August 2006. He was\nplaced on probation for operating a motor vehicle in May 2003 after his license had\nbeen suspended. The available evidence fails to substantiate the July 2002 violation of\nthe Abuse Prevention Act, but while he also denies any culpability with respect to the\nJanuary 2005 charges,  court records indicate that sufficient facts were found to sustain\nfindings that he operated a motor vehicle while his license was suspended, left the\nscene with property damage, and used a motor vehicle without authority. His case was\nultimately dismissed without a finding, but not until after he had paid $2,515.88 in\nrestitution. Even if I accept Applicant\u2019s testimony that he did not drive his friend\u2019s car in\nOctober 2004 without a license and without authority, AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\n\n9\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot reasonably be applied, given his\nrecord of criminal violations. Furthermore, AG \u00b6 32(c), \u201cevidence that the person did not\ncommit the offense,\u201d has limited applicability in this case only to the allegations of\ndomestic abuse. It would not mitigate his admitted drug manufacture and distribution, or\nhis repeated operation of a vehicle while his license was suspended or revoked.\nApplicant\u2019s good work performance in his defense contractor employment is\nsome evidence of reform under AG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education; good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d It has been four plus\nyears since Applicant was charged criminally, and three years since he last used an\nillicit drug. Yet, insufficient reform in his personal life, evidenced most recently by\nspeeding, excessive drinking at times, and continuing association with illegal drug\nusers, preclude me from concluding that his criminal conduct is safely in the past.\nDrug Involvement\nThe security concern about drug involvement is set out in Guideline H, AG \u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nApplicant went off to college without a valid operator\u2019s license because of his\nrepeatedly driving after suspension or revocation. When he could not find a job nearby,\nhe and his roommate began manufacturing and distributing LSD (and apparently\nmescaline) in the summer of 1997. Applicant began using LSD as well, and he\ncontinued his drug involvement until he was arrested in October 1997. Afforded a fresh\nstart after he was paroled, Applicant returned to his old drug using habits in February\n2004. Over the next seven months, Applicant used cocaine and ecstasy on weekends\nwhen socializing with friends. Then in August 2006, he snorted cocaine while drinking\non at least one occasion. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug\n\nApplicant\u2019s largest medical debt (SOR 3.e) was reportedly placed for collection in September 2006\n6\nafter there had been no activity on the account since March 2004 (Ex. 4).\n10\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d are implicated.\nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug involvement, when viewed as a whole, cannot reasonably\nbe considered as \u201cso long ago,\u201d or as \u201cso infrequent\u201d to qualify for mitigation under AG \u00b6\n26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Although I find Applicant credible\nwhen he denies any intent to use illegal drugs in the future, it is not enough to satisfy\nAG \u00b6 26(b), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.\u201d He continues\nto associate with friends and family members (sister) who use illegal drugs, so AG \u00b6\n26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts,\u201d is not satisfied.\nApplicant has been at a couple of barbecues in the past few summers where others\nhave smoked marijuana. While he exhibited good judgment by not using the drug\nhimself on those occasions (See AG \u00b6 26(b)(2), \u201cchanging or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs were used\u201d), he has been susceptible to peer influence in the past, as\nwhen he used cocaine on multiple occasions in 2004 after some experience with NA\nand AA, and seven years of abstinence from illegal drugs. He used cocaine on at least\none more occasion, in August 2006. His present three years of abstinence is not long\nenough to qualify as an \u201cappropriate period of abstinence\u201d under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), given\nhis history of drug involvement and ongoing association with known illegal drug users.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nAs of his e-QIP in September 2007, Applicant was seriously delinquent on a retail\ncharge account (SOR 3.d), on some medical debts (SOR 3.c, 3.e-3.f),  and on a utility\n6\naccount (SOR 3.g). He incurred additional medical debt following a motorcycle accident\nin 2008. While he has been making payments to his orthopedist and physical therapist,\na couple of medical debts from 2008 totaling $163 were placed for collection (SOR 3.a-\n3.b). Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and\nAG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply in\n\n11\nmitigation. Accounts were placed for collection as recently as May 2009, and Applicant\nhad made little effort to address his old delinquencies as of September 2009.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is implicated in part. Applicant\u2019s April 2008\nmotorcycle accident was outside of his control. While most of his delinquent medical\ndebt predated the accident, out-of-pocket payments for prescriptions, and for orthopedic\nand physical therapy services from the accident, impacted his ability to repay his\ndelinquent debts. However, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not mitigate his questionable financial\ndecisions. After he used loan proceeds to pay off a delinquent balance on his account\nwith the creditor in SOR 3.d, he ran up new charges on his reinstated account that he\nthen failed to pay. In July 2008, he financed the purchase of a new motorcycle taking\nout a loan of $20,528 when delinquent debts remain unpaid. About $800 of his income\ntax refund for tax year 2008 was spent on a camping vacation instead of delinquent\ndebt repayment.\nApplicant testified credibly that he contacted the creditor in SOR 3.d in\nSeptember 2009 and arranged to pay $75 per month toward the debt starting in October\n2009. This belated effort to address his debt is not enough to apply either AG \u00b6 20(c),\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d or AG \u00b6 20(d),\n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\u201d Applicant expects to receive sufficient funds from an insurance\nsettlement to cover his delinquent obligations. But the evidence of record is insufficient\nto mitigate the financial concerns.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern about personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant failed to indicate on his September 2007 e-QIP that he had been\ncharged in July 2002 with violating the Abuse Prevention Act; that he had been found\nguilty of operating a vehicle in May 2003 after license suspension;  or that he had been\ncharged in January 2005 with operating a vehicle after suspension, leaving the scene of\nproperty damage, and use of a vehicle without authority. These charges fell within the\nscope of question 23.f concerning any arrests within the last seven years. Applicant has\nconsistently denied any intentional concealment, maintaining that he misread the\nquestion as pertaining to convictions only. The 2002 and 2005 charges were continued\n\nDespite Applicant\u2019s abuse of alcohol on occasion, the government did not allege Guideline G, alcohol\n7\nconsumption. In the absence of any evidence to indicate that Applicant was intoxicated or impaired on the job,\nor drinking on the job, it would not qualify as an alcohol-related incident under Guideline G, AG \u00b6 22(b),\n\u201calcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition,\nor drinking on the job, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent.\u201d So the loss of his job, due in part to his off-duty drinking, would not be explicitly covered under\nGuideline G.\n12\nwithout a finding, although Applicant had to pay substantial restitution for the 2005\nleaving the scene with property damage charge. The 2003 operating a vehicle after\nsuspension charge was dismissed, but only after he had been placed on probation.  The\ne-QIP inquiry at issue (\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or\nconvicted of any offense(s) not listed. . . .\u201d) is clearly stated, but Applicant\u2019s disclosures\nof his dated yet very serious felony drug offense, of his employment terminations, and of\nhis recent drug use lead me to conclude that Applicant lacked the willful intent required\nfor AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d \nAs alleged in SOR 4.b, Applicant\u2019s abuse of alcohol led to a loss of his\nemployment at a car dealership in July 2002. AG \u00b6 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information\nthat is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself\nfor an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation,\u201d is implicated.  Applicant reported to work with hangovers from drinking the\n7\nnight before, and he wore sunglasses at times to conceal that he had been drinking to\nexcess. There is no evidence that he has allowed alcohol to negatively effect his\npresent employment, and seven years have passed since Applicant was dismissed from\na job due in part to drinking. But I am unable to fully mitigate the judgment concerns\nunder AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior\nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d As recently as August 2009, Applicant consumed 20 beers at a pig roast. He\nand a friend share about 30 beers once a month and he sees no need to change that\nbehavior. Concerns persist for his judgment and reliability given his binge drinking.\nApplicant does not dispute the issuance of a civil restraining order against him in\nApril 2002 (SOR 4.c), but he denies any factual basis for the order (\u201cit was all fiction,\u201d\nTr. 34). AG \u00b616(e), \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s\nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing,\u201d is potentially applicable because the issuance of a restraining\norder could negatively affect Applicant\u2019s reputation. But the available record evidence\ndid not sufficiently establish that Applicant abused his former girlfriend, or that he\n\n13\ncontacted her in violation of the protection order. AG \u00b6 17(f), \u201cthe information was\nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability,\u201d applies to mitigate the\nissuance of the restraining order.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant made a serious error in judgment in becoming involved in LSD\nmanufacture and distribution in 1997. After he was paroled, he took steps toward\nbecoming a productive member of society, but he showed immaturity and disregard of\nthe law in repeatedly operating a motor vehicle after his license had been suspended or\nrevoked. He turned to alcohol after he and his fiancee broke up in 2002, and drank to\nexcess on a daily basis in June and July 2002. In 2004, he succumbed to peer influence\nand used cocaine and ecstacy on the weekends for about seven months. Sufficient\nfacts were found to sustain findings that he had operated a friend\u2019s car without a valid\nlicense and without her permission, and left the scene of an accident involving property\ndamage in October 2004, although he denies any involvement. In August 2006, he\nsnorted cocaine while out drinking with a friend. A motorcycle accident in April 2008 set\nhim back financially. Yet, he exhibited poor financial judgment by financing a new\nmotorcycle for $20,528 in July 2008, when he owed delinquent debts in collection.\nApplicant has abstained from illegal drugs since August 2006, but he risks his sobriety\nby binge drinking and by continuing to associate with illegal drug users. He has\nperformed his duties with a defense contractor in a fully satisfactory manner since his\nhire in late September 2007. However, he has yet to demonstrate that he possesses the\ngood judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required for access to classified\ninformation.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n14\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had significant\noutstanding debts, and was still trying to resolve his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing,\nthe Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors, and reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence\nwas insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case\nde novo.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application, Standard Form 86, on \nSeptember 6, 2007. On October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nOn January 23, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 9, 2009. On \nFebruary 10, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for March 4, \n2009. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered seven exhibits which \nwere admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 7. Applicant testified and offered four \nexhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - D. The record was held \nopen until March 18, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. He timely \nApril 9, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nsubmitted a nine-page document which was admitted as AE E. The transcript was \nreceived on March 23, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, , 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.s, 1.t, 1.u, 1.v, and 1.w. \nHe denies the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.n, and 1.r.  \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old equipment specialist employed with a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking a security clearance.

(Tr at 6-8, 47; Gov 1; AE C; AE E at 9)  \n \nOn September 6, 2007, Applicant completed a questionnaire for sensitive \npositions (SF-86), in order to apply for a security clearance. (Gov 1) A subsequent \nbackground investigation revealed that Applicant had 23 delinquent accounts, an \napproximate total balance of $16,625. The delinquent accounts include:  a $189 medical \ndebt placed for collection in June 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 5; Gov 4 at 5; Gov 7 at \n10); a $392.99 deficiency balance after an automobile repossession in May 2002 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at 4; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 3; Gov 7 at 5); a $1,961 deficiency \nbalance owed after an automobile repossession in August 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 2 at 4; \nGov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 3; Gov 7 at 6); a $261 mail order catalogue account \nplaced for collection in September 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 5; Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 2; \nGov 6 at 2-3; Gov 7 at 7, 9, 11); a $1,158 telephone account placed for collection in \nOctober 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 at 4; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2-3; Gov 7 at 4); \nand a $20 medical account placed for collection in January 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 2 at 4; \nGov 4 at 3; Gov 7 at 7). \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include:  a $228 medical debt placed for collection \nin January 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 2 at 6; Gov 4 at 6; Gov 7 at 11); a $253 telephone \naccount placed for collection in April 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 2 at 5; Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at \n2; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 7, 11); a $738 credit card account placed for collection in May \n2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 2 at 4; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 4); a $510  \naccount placed for collection in January 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 2 at 6; Gov 4 at 6); a \n$1,684 medical account placed for collection in October 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 2 at 5; \nGov 4 at 4; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 8, 11); and a $118 cable bill placed for collection in \nJanuary 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 2 at 6; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 7). \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include:  a $164 Direct TV account placed for \ncollection in July 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 1); an $81 account that was \n120 days delinquent since August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.n: Gov 5 at 2); a $636 overdrawn \n\n \n3 \n \n \nchecking account placed for collection in September 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.o: Gov 2 at 5; Gov \n4 at 5; Gov 7 at 9); a $486 cell phone account placed for collection in October 2007 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.p: Gov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 2); a $3,800 loan charged off as a bad debt in \nNovember 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.q: Gov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 3); and a $1,974 account charged off \nas a bad debt in April 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.r: Gov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 3). \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include:  a $73 delinquent medical account placed \nfor collection in December 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.s: Gov 2 at 5; Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 \nat 2; Gov 7 at 8); a $53 medical account placed for collection in March 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.t: \nGov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 1); a $100 medical account placed for collection in January 2004 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.u: Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 8); a $1,429 medical account placed for \ncollection in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.v: Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2); and a $317 medical \naccount placed for collection in August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.w: Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2). \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began around 2002. In December 2002, he injured \nhis knee on the job. He underwent three knee surgeries. He and his wife agreed that he \nwould stay at home and look after the children and she would work. This allowed time \nfor his knee to be rehabilitated. He and his wife divorced in October 2004. (Tr at 38-40)  \n  \nIn 2004, Applicant moved in with his brother. He was unemployed between \nDecember 2002 to February 2005.  In February 2005, he moved to where he currently \nresides and got a job driving a truck. In March 2005, he was in a serious car accident \nwhile on the job. Two people died in the accident and Applicant suffered significant \ninjuries. He was unable to work from March 2005 until June 2006. During that time, he \nreceived workmen\u2019s compensation in the amount of $1,000 per month. (Tr at 40-43; \nGov 1, section 22)  \n \nApplicant is involved in a custody battle with his ex-wife. She took the children \nand moved across the country without notifying Applicant or the court. He has not seen \nhis children in two years. So far, he has spent approximately $2,400 in legal expenses \npursuing custody of his children. (Tr at 20, 48; Gov 4 at 7) \n \nAt hearing, Applicant claimed a lot of the debts alleged in the SOR belong to his \nex-wife. He claims they were supposed to be equally responsible for the debts of the \nmarriage. (Tr at 35) In a prior interview with an investigator conducting his background \ninvestigation on October 31, 2007, he said that he was responsible for 90% of the debt \nafter the divorce. (Gov 2 at 6) He claims the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is solely his \nwife\u2019s responsibility. (Tr at 37) He paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n. It is listed as paid \nin the March 3, 2009 credit report. (Tr at 34; Gov 5 at 2) SOR \u00b6 1.n is found for \nApplicant.  All of the other debts remain outstanding. (Tr at 38.)  \n \nApplicant recently was promoted. He earns $17.40 an hour. (AE A) His net \nmonthly income is approximately $1,634.  Child support is deducted automatically from \nhis paycheck each month.  He lives with his fianc\u00e9 who works part-time and goes to \nschool. He pays her $300 a month which covers rent and other related bills. In addition, \nhe has the following monthly bills: $365 for car and insurance, $100 for cell phone; $300 \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfor groceries; $50 for clothes; $75 for entertainment. He has no credit cards and no \nsavings.  He estimates he has $75 left over after expenses each paycheck.  He hopes \nto begin making payments towards his delinquent accounts. (Tr at 27-34; AE D) He is \ncurrent on federal and state income taxes. (Tr at 49) \n \nHe works a part-time job as a bouncer. He estimates he earns approximately \n$400 per month in this job. (Tr at 53-54) He owes his sister $500 and his brother $500. \n(Tr at 55) He has never attended financial counseling. (Tr at 56)  \n \nApplicant loves his job. It is the best job that he has ever had. (Tr at 19) His \nprogram manager states that he is a \u201cdependable, loyal, and hardworking employee.\u201d \nHe states Applicant\u2019s integrity, truthfulness, and work ethic are above reproach. (AE E \nat 1)  The CEO of another company states Applicant has worked for his company since \nJune 2006, working in various departments, He states Applicant\u2019s ethics, integrity and \ndedication to his job has made him the company\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d guy. (AE E at 2: Note: The \nrecord is unclear as to whether this company and the Applicant\u2019s full-time employer are \nconnected.)  \n \nApplicant provided an unsigned copy of a performance report which rates him as \na \u201c5\u201d which indicates his performance level is well above the expectations of the job. \nThis performance report is given less weight because it is unsigned and the names of \nApplicant\u2019s evaluators are not listed on the report. (AE E at 3-8) He has completed \nseveral training courses in conjunction with his job. (AE B) \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Since 2001, Applicant accumulated 23 \ndelinquent accounts, totaling approximately $16,625. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. All \nbut one of Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts remain unresolved. Although employed full-\ntime since October 2006, he has not established a plan to resolve these accounts. \nApplicant continues to have financial problems. His failure to establish a plan to resolve \nhis delinquent accounts raises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness, and \nreliability.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s medical issues, \nhis divorce in 2004, his custody issues, and his March 2005 automobile accident \naggravated his financial problems. He was unable to work for more than a year after the \naccident. However, Applicant has been employed full-time since July 2006. He \ncontinued to incur delinquent accounts even though fully employed. In addition, he has \nno plan to resolve his delinquent accounts. This mitigating condition is given less weight \nbecause Applicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances.   \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not consulted a credit counselor. It is unlikely his \nfinancial problems will be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.n. It does not \napply toward the remaining delinquent accounts.  A promise to pay in the future is not \nsufficient to mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s previous \nmilitary service. I considered his periods of unemployment as a result of on-the-job \ninjuries. I considered the additional expenses related to Applicant\u2019s divorce and child \ncustody issues. While all of these matters mitigate the reasons for Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation, he has been employed full-time for over two and a half years.

On September 15, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under paragraphs 1(a) and (b) of Guideline F; paragraphs 2(a) and 2(d) of\n1\nGuideline E; and paragraphs 3(a-d) of Guideline H are not at issue in this appeal.\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March\n26, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her application\nof the pertinent mitigating conditions and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law .  Finding no error, we affirm.  \n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant is a 54-year-old\nemployee of a Defense contractor seeking to maintain a security clearance.  He has held a clearance\nsince 1995.  He has been divorced twice and has three adult children from his prior marriages.  In\n1999 Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and was discharged in bankruptcy in 2000.\nApplicant has several delinquent debts, for such things as credit cards, bounced checks, etc.  The\nJudge\u2019s findings and the record evidence demonstrate that these debts became delinquent subsequent\nto Applicant\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy.  On his security clearance application, Applicant was asked\nif he had any debts over 180 days delinquent and if he had debts that were currently 90 days\ndelinquent.  Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to both questions.  These answers were not true.  At the\nhearing, it was discovered that Applicant owes federal income taxes for 2004, 2005, and 2006.\nThese debts were not alleged in the SOR.  \nRegarding Guideline F, Applicant contends that the Judge did not assign sufficient weight\nto his mitigating evidence, including evidence about (1) the financial consequences of his two prior\ndivorces; (2) the fact that his current wife has handled the family finances and that Applicant was\nunaware of the financial delinquencies; and (3) that he now turns his paycheck over to his father-in-\nlaw, who pays the family bills.  Concerning Guideline E, Applicant argues alternatively that either\nthe evidence does not support the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant engaged in falsifications, or the\nfalsifications were mitigated.  Applicant also argues that the Judge should have found that his\ninvolvement with illegal drugs under Guideline H was mitigated.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or vice versa.\nApplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\n\nThe record demonstrates that the Judge considered Applicant\u2019s delinquent federal income taxes on the question\n2\nof mitigation.  Decision at 3-4. The Judge also addressed what she viewed as the inherent unreasonableness of\nApplicant\u2019s having relied upon his wife to take care of the family\u2019s finances, in light of the fact that the wife \u201chad\nsubstance abuse problems.\u201d  Id. at 7.  \n3\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd.

He has \ncalled several credit counseling agencies but has not entered into an agreement with \nany of them. His focus is to pay the bills that are current as well as the mortgage.  \nApplicant gives his paycheck to his father-in-law. His father-in-law lives nearby. He pays \nApplicant and his wife\u2019s bills. (Tr at 31-32, 46, 48) \n \nThe two state tax liens were the result of a mistake Applicant\u2019s accountant made \non his state tax returns.

He also thinks that he has not filed taxes for one \nof the tax years but is not sure which one it is. Applicant claims that his wife was \nresponsible for filing and paying the tax returns. (Tr at 40-42) He also had federal \nincome tax problems in 1994 and 1995. (Gov 8, Schedule F; Gov 10) (Applicant\u2019s \nfederal income taxes were not alleged in the SOR. His recent federal income tax \nproblems for tax years 2004, 2005, and 2006 were not discovered until the hearing.

His cars will be paid off after one more $600 car payment. His \nutilities are about $600. He owes his father about $5,000. He has not been making \npayments towards this loan. He pays for his son\u2019s college. (Tr at 48-49)  \n \nOn September 18, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator who was \nconducting his background investigation. He told the investigator that he used cocaine \nonce in 2000 or 2001.  He tried cocaine after drinking alcohol. He used the cocaine on \nan experimental basis and has not used it since. He held a security clearance at the \ntime he used cocaine. At hearing, Applicant testified that his wife bought the cocaine. In \nthe summary of his personal subject interview, it states Applicant bought the cocaine at \nan undisclosed location. (Tr at 50-53, 59; Gov 2 at 3; Gov 13) \n \nApplicant did not list his use of cocaine in 2000 or 2001 on his security clearance \napplication in response to section 24(a) because he did not consider himself a drug \nuser. He only tried it once.  During his meeting with the security investigator, he \nbelieved that the investigator asked the question in a different way. He told the \ninvestigator that he used cocaine once when the investigator asked him whether he had \never used illegal drugs. (Tr at 36-37)   \n \nOn February 28, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of \nCocaine and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia. He was pulled over for having expired \ntags. The car was a rental. The police officer asked Applicant for his driver\u2019s license and \nregistration. When he reached into his right rear pocket for his wallet, a glass tubular \nitem fell to the ground. The police officer recognized this glass tubular item to be a pipe \nthat is used for smoking crack cocaine. The police officer searched the vehicle and \ndiscovered under the driver\u2019s side seat a plastic zippered bag which contained four \nmore tubular pipes that are used for smoking crack cocaine. He also discovered a \npeppermint tin which contained ten \u201cchore boy\u201d scrubbing balls. These balls are used in \npipes to smoke crack cocaine. His wife was sitting in the passenger\u2019s seat and denied \nall knowledge of the pipes.  Field tests on one of the balls and one of the pipes received \na presumptive positive for cocaine. (Gov 3) \n \nOn September 18, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator who was \nconducting his background investigation. He told the investigator that on the day of the \narrest, he found drug paraphernalia in the rental that did not belong to him. He put the \ndrug paraphernalia in his pocket. He did not contact the rental car agency about his \ndiscovery. (Gov 2 at 3, 6) \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that the drug paraphernalia in the car \nbelonged to his wife. He put the drug paraphernalia in his pocket and got arrested for it. \nThe charges were nolle prossed on March 30, 2006. Applicant has not failed a drug test \n\n \n5 \n \n \nat work in over 26 years. (Tr at 37-38; Gov 4; Gov 5) He listed the arrest in response to \nsection 23 on his March 27, 2006, security clearance application. (Gov 1)  \n \nApplicant did not provide any evidence pertaining to his work performance and \noverall character.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has encountered financial \ndifficulty since the 1990s. In 1997, two state tax liens were filed against Applicant. In \n1999, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He continued to incur delinquent debts after his \nbankruptcy discharge. The SOR alleged 18 delinquent accounts that were incurred after \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy discharge, a total approximate balance of $10,469. \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept, 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. Aside from the state tax liens, he has \nnot started to resolve his remaining delinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.d \u2013 1.u. He \nalso owes federal income taxes for tax years 2004, 2005 and 2006. He claims that his \nwife handled all of the finances and was responsible for filing the tax returns. \nConsidering her substance abuse problems, this raises further questions about his \n\n \n7 \n \n \njudgment since it is likely that his wife could not be relied on to pay the bills when she \nwas using illegal drugs. While Applicant\u2019s father-in-law has taken responsibility for  \npaying the current bills, nothing has been done with regard to the delinquent accounts.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. Applicant has been \ncontinuously employed with the same company for 11 years. Nothing has occurred \nduring that time which would have prevented Applicant from taking responsibility for his \nexpenses.  He entrusted control of the family finances to his wife who had substance \nabuse problems. It was and is within his discretion to take control of his financial \nsituation. He chose not to do so. He did not act responsibly under the circumstances.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant contacted several credit counseling agencies over the \nphone but never attended financial counseling. He has no plan to resolve his delinquent \naccounts. It is unlikely that his financial problems will be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the state tax liens alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.b. However, his remaining delinquent debt remains unresolved and he \nhas not developed a plan to resolve his remaining delinquent accounts. His father-in-law \npays his current bills for him but his delinquent accounts remain unresolved. Nine of the \ndelinquent accounts are about $100 or less and should have been manageable to \nresolve. Applicant is not accepting responsibility for his financial situation. He has not  \nmade a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts.   \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his  \nfinancial delinquencies in response to sections 28(a) and 28(b) on his security \nclearance application, dated February 9, 2007.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n  \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies in \nApplicant\u2019s case. For PC DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission of his delinquent \naccounts must be done with a deliberate intent to deceive. I find Applicant intended to \nfalsify his security clearance application. He must have been aware that the finances \nwere not being handled properly given his wife\u2019s drug addiction. Applicant claims that he \nwas not aware of all of his financial delinquencies. I do not find his explanation credible.  \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are also raised because Applicant did not list his \n2000/2001 cocaine use in response to section 24(a) on his March 27, 2006, security \nclearance application. Applicant claims that he did not list his 2000/2001 cocaine use in \nresponse to section 24(a) because he does not consider himself to be an illegal drug \nuser. He interpreted the question to mean habitual user. He disclosed the illegal drug \nuse during his September 18, 2007, interview with the investigator conducting his \nbackground investigation. He claims the investigator asked a more direct question. He \nlisted his February 2006 arrest for possession of cocaine and possession of drug \nparaphernalia on his March 27, 2006, security clearance application which put the \ngovernment on notice as to Applicant\u2019s issues with illegal drugs. I give Applicant the \nbenefit of the doubt with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a.  \n \n \nI find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.d because it is alleged and more \nappropriately considered under Guideline H, Drug Involvement.  \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG &24:       \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) & 25(a) (any drug \nabuse); DI DC \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia); and \nDI DC \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance) apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. He admits to illegally using cocaine on one occasion in 2000 or 2001. \nHe held a security clearance at the time he used cocaine. He was arrested in February \n2006 for possession of cocaine and possession of drug paraphernalia. The policeman \nwho stopped Applicant during a routine traffic stop observed a pipe used for smoking \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncrack cocaine fall out of Applicant\u2019s pocket. The residue on the pipe tested positive for \ncocaine. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Two potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Drug \nInvolvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) does not  apply. While Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine occurred more than eight \nyears ago, his arrest for drug paraphernalia is fairly recent. A disposition by the court of \nnolle prosse does not mean Applicant was exonerated of the charge. Doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment remain because of Applicant\u2019s \ninconsistent statements pertaining to his involvement with illegal drugs.   \n \nRegarding his 2000/2001 cocaine use, Applicant told the investigator during his \npersonal subject interview that he purchased the cocaine at an undisclosed location. At \nhearing, he claimed his wife provided him with the cocaine. \n \nRegarding his February 2006 arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia, the \npolice report contains no information as to whether Applicant denied that the drug \nparaphernalia was his.  The police report indicates Applicant\u2019s wife was in the car and \nshe denied any knowledge of the drug paraphernalia. During his personal subject \ninterview, Applicant claimed he found the drug paraphernalia in his rental car and put it \nin his pocket. It did not belong to him. During the hearing, Applicant claimed the drug \nparaphernalia belonged to his wife. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements pertaining to his \nillegal drug involvement continue to raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. DI MC \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \n \n \nThe second mitigating condition that potentially applies is FC MC & 26(b) (a \ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation \nfrom drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment \nwhere drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed \nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.)  Applicant \nprovided no evidence to support application of this mitigating condition. \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \n\n \n10 \n \n \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While Applicant has taken steps \ntowards ensuring that his current financial accounts are being paid, he has no plan in \nplace regarding resolving his delinquent accounts. Considering Applicant\u2019s long history \nof financial irresponsibility, it is too soon to conclude that his financial issues will be \nresolved due to the significant amount of his unresolved delinquent debt. He did not \nmitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations. I find against Applicant \nunder the personal conduct concern because his explanation that he was not aware of \nhis financial situation was not credible. Questions remain under Guideline H because of \nApplicant\u2019s inconsistent statements pertaining to his illegal drug involvement. Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised under Financial Considerations, Personal \nConduct, and Drug Involvement.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On May 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  detailing the security concerns under\n1\nGuideline E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR, answered the allegations on June\n16, 2009, and requested a decision on the record. Department Counsel requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. I received the case assignment on August 14,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 14, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nOctober 14, 2009\n\n2\nas scheduled on September 9, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE 1-5), which\nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He did not\npresent any exhibits for the record. DOHA received the transcript on September 17,\n2009. Based upon a review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and\n1.b of the SOR.  He acknowledged that he deliberately falsified his security clearance\napplication for fear of losing his job.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

He has worked in a\nprofessional capacity in the electrical engineering field for his entire career. He has\nbeen with his current employer since 1995 (Tr. 19). Applicant has held a security\nclearance for eleven years.\nApplicant smoked marijuana from 1984 until 1995. He acknowledged this illegal\ndrug use in his December 1996 security clearance application (GE 3). Applicant signed\na statement at that time that his intent was to abstain from marijuana in the future (Tr.\n27). However, he continued to use marijuana while holding a security clearance.\nApplicant was diagnosed with a bipolar disorder in 2003 (GE 2). His physician\nprescribed medications for his manic disorder. Applicant chose to self-medicate with\nmarijuana. He used the illegal drug to help with his anxiety and subsequent depression.\nHe continued to use marijuana on a daily basis until July 2003 (Tr. 32).

He\nresponded \u201cno\u201d to question 24(a) concerning use of illegal drugs and drug activity.\nApplicant also answered \u201cno\u201d to question 24(b) concerning the use of any illegal drug\nwhile holding a security clearance. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted that he\nfalsified material facts on the 2007 SF 86.\nAt the hearing, Applicant was candid. He stated he knew he lied to the\ngovernment concerning his use of marijuana. He did not tell his employer of many years\nthat he used marijuana (Tr. 21). He never admitted the illegal use or tried to correct the\nmisinformation in his security clearance application from 2007 prior to the answers to\nthe SOR allegations. He admitted that he probably would not have told the truth about\nthe illegal drug use if the government had not discovered the drug use in his medical\nrecords (Tr. 22). He explained that during his manic period in 2003, he used marijuana\nfor approximately five months. He used marijuana almost every day, using a pipe. He\nstopped using the marijuana in 2003 because his medication seemed to keep him on a\n\n3\nsteady pace. However, he admitted at the hearing that he cannot say that he will not\nuse marijuana in the future. He acknowledged this despite the fact that it is against the\nlaw and against his employer\u2019s drug policy. He deeply regrets his lack of candor about\nhis marijuana use.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n4\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 16(a) a disqualifying condition exists when there is \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 16(b) a disqualifying condition exists when \u201cdeliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d\nApplicant executed his security clearance application on February 20, 2007. He\nadmitted that he falsified information concerning his illegal drug use out of fear of losing\nhis employment. He had already promised in 1996, when he received a security\nclearance, that he would not use marijuana in the future. Nonetheless, he chose not to\nanswer \u201cYes\u201d to either question on his 2007 security clearance application concerning\nhis use of marijuana in 2003. Applicant failed to disclose illegal drug use while holding a\nsecurity clearance for many years. His behavior and personal conduct are disqualifying\nas they raise questions about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with the\nlaw. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17, I find that none of\nthem apply in this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\n\n5\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well-educated\nprofessional. He served in a professional capacity for his entire career. He has held a\nsecurity clearance for a number of years. He acknowledged his early use of marijuana\nin his 1996 application. He signed a statement that he would not use an illegal drug in\nthe future. In 2003, Applicant used marijuana during his time with his current employer.\nHe self-medicated due to his bipolar condition and his depression. He knew this was\nagainst the employment and DoD policy and in violation of his duties as a holder of a\nsecurity clearance. He completed a security clearance application in February 2007 and\ndeliberately falsified his responses to two questions. He admitted that he probably\nwould never have admitted the illegal drug use if the government had not discovered\nthe records. \nApplicant made no attempt to correct his falsifications prior to being confronted.\nHe deeply regrets the situation. He was very candid and honest at the hearing but that\ndoes not overcome or mitigate his poor judgment and dishonesty. He also\nacknowledged that he could not promise that he would not use marijuana in the future if\nhis mania returned. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all the\nreasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his drug involvement and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 15, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 14, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Matthew E.\nMalone denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nSpecifically, Applicant contends that he was harmed by his failure to hire an attorney to\nrepresent him at the hearing.  Applicant also argues that the Judge should have found that the SOR\nallegations against him were mitigated.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant retired from federal\ncivilian employment in 2003 with 32 years of service.  In 2005, he obtained a job with a private firm.\nIn July 2007, as part of his job, Applicant purchased three cases of diesel oil.  He deposited two cases\nin the appropriate locker at work.  Applicant drove home with one case of the oil still in his truck\nand put it in his garage.  When asked the next day by his supervisor if he had taken the oil, Applicant\ndenied doing so.  Applicant later admitted to his supervisor that he had lied and was suspended and\nlater fired.  On August 28, 2007, Applicant filled out a security clearance application as part of the\napplication for his current job and intentionally omitted the fact that he had been fired from his\nprevious job.  In mid-December, Applicant admitted to his boss that he had lied on his security\nclearance application.  On December 28, 2007, Applicant admitted the lie to a government\ninvestigator who was going over the application with him, but not until they reached the appropriate\nquestion on the application.\nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s lengthy career as a Federal employee, he also had a successful\ncareer in the United States Army and National Guard.  Applicant also submitted a letter of\nrecommendation from the boss to whom he admitted that he had lied on his security clearance.\nApplicant contends that he was harmed by his failure to hire an attorney to represent him at\nthe hearing.  Applicant states that he believed that he was prepared for the hearing, but after the\nhearing started, he realized that he should have retained an attorney.  Since the hearing, Applicant\nhas concluded \u201cthe government is heavily favored.\u201d  \nPrior to the hearing, Applicant was sent a memorandum entitled \u201cPreliminary Guidance for\nDOHA Industrial Security Clearance (ISCR) Hearings and Trustworthiness (ADP) Hearings.\u201d  The\nfirst numbered paragraph of that memorandum advises applicants that \u201cthe government is normally\nrepresented by an attorney known as a Department Counsel.  The Applicant has the option of\nappearing by himself or herself without an attorney, or being represented by an attorney selected and\npaid for by the Applicant, or by being represented by a Personal Representative such as a friend,\nfamily member, or union representative.\u201d  At the hearing, Applicant testified that he had completed\n\n3\nhigh school and earned an Associate\u2019s Degree.  Transcript at 6.  He also testified that he had received\na copy of the Directive and the pre-hearing guidance and that he had read and understood them.\nTranscript at 8.  The Judge found that Applicant was able to represent himself.  Id.  The record\nindicates that Applicant submitted evidence and actively participated in the hearing.  During the\nhearing, Applicant never indicated that he was unable to represent himself.  Considering the record\nas a whole, the Board concludes Applicant waived his right to be represented by an attorney.  \nAn applicant who decides to represent himself at a hearing cannot later complain about the\nquality of his own representation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0086 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2000).\nA review of the record in this case shows that Applicant had a reasonable opportunity to prepare for\nthe hearing and to present evidence on his own behalf, and Applicant has not demonstrated\notherwise.  Merely because Applicant has decided , with the benefit of hindsight, that he could have\npresented a better case if he had been represented by an attorney, it does not follow that Applicant\nwas denied the opportunity to prepare and present his case.  Applicant has not demonstrated error\nin this regard.  See Dusanek v. Hannon, 677 F.2d 538, 542-43 (7  Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S.\nth\n1017 (1982).\nApplicant also argues that the Judge should have found his conduct to be mitigated because\nhe regrets the conduct and is rehabilitated and because the conduct is an isolated incident and is so\nremote.  The Judge considered the considered Applicant\u2019s evidence of mitigation.  However, the\npresence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security\nclearance.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether\nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-10454 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2008). \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct.  The Judge considered the possible application\nof relevant mitigating conditions and discussed why he did not apply them in Applicant\u2019s case.  The\nJudge explained why the evidence Applicant presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome\nthe government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29,  2005).\nGiven the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under\nGuideline E is sustainable.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s unfavorable security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

According to Applicant, one day at work in\nJuly 2007, he drove his personal vehicle to a local supplier to get three cases of motor\noil for use in the forklifts in his department. The locker where the motor oil was stored\ncould only fit two cases, so he stored two and left one in his truck. It is unclear why, if he\nknew the locker would only store two cases of oil, he obtained three cases. When he left\nwork for the day, Applicant the extra case of oil was still in his truck. When he got home,\nhe took the oil out of the truck and put it in his garage. He did not take it back in to work\nthe next day. The motor oil was a high-detergent 40-weight brand for diesel engines of\n\n3\nthe type used at Applicant\u2019s place of work. Applicant did not own a vehicle with a diesel\nengine and had no personal use for the motor oil he took home that day. (Ax. A; Tr. 23 -\n26, 38) The next day, his supervisor asked him if he had taken the oil. Applicant denied\nhaving done so. Because his actions had been \u201ceating\u201d (Tr. 27) at him, he later went to\nhis supervisor and told him what he had done. As required by company policy, the\nsupervisor suspended Applicant, who was fired for theft a few days later. A letter from\nthat supervisor advised that a fellow employee saw Applicant put the motor oil into his\ntruck. (Tr. 26 - 27; Gx. 2; Ax. A)\nOn August 28, 2007, Applicant submitted his e-QIP as part of the hiring process\nfor his current job. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant intentionally omitted from his e-\nQIP the fact that he had been fired from his previous job. Applicant did so because he\nwas embarrassed by the fact he had been fired for theft. While he was overseas\nworking for his company, he asked his company\u2019s Facilities Security Officer (FSO),\nwithout explaining why he would want to do so, how to make changes to the e-QIP he\nhad submitted. Applicant was told there was no way to do so and that he should just\nwait until he returned to the United States and was interviewed by investigators.\nAlthough he claims his deception caused him a great deal of stress, it was not until mid-\nDecember 2007, and after he learned that co-workers who had applied around the\nsame time were being granted their clearances while his was still in an interim status,\nthat he told his boss that he had lied on his e-QIP. (Tr. 31 - 33, 45 - 46)\nApplicant was interviewed for his clearance by a government investigator on\nDecember 28, 2007. The investigator proceeded to review the questions and answers in\nthe e-QIP. Applicant made corrections to some of the information as the investigator\nwent question-by-question. When she came to question 22, Applicant told her he had\nbeen fired from his previous job and stated he had lied when he submitted the form.\n(Gx. 2; Tr. 28 - 29, 45 - 47) Applicant did not offer to correct his e-QIP answer until the\ngovernment investigator came to question 22 during her review of the e-QIP. The\ngovernment investigator did not confront Applicant during the interview with any other\nrecord of his firing in order to contradict the \u201cno\u201d answer to question 22. (Tr. 49 - 51)\nAside from the facts surrounding his firing and his false answer on his e-QIP,\nApplicant\u2019s background is devoid of any misconduct or other questionable behavior. He\nserved with distinction for 28 years in the U.S. Army and National Guard, retiring in\n2002 as a Command Sergeant Major. His civilian record is equally impressive and he\nreceived numerous awards for his work as an employee of the Departments of the Navy\nand Army through 2003. More recently, the manager who hired him for his current job,\nand to whom Applicant confessed he had lied on his e-QIP, regards Applicant as a\nvalued, honest and trustworthy employee. Applicant is viewed in a similar light by his\nprogram manager. The supervisor who fired him in July 2007 feels Applicant has\nlearned his lesson. Applicant\u2019s most recent performance evaluation shows he is an\nexcellent worker. (Ax. A)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n4\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n5\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support, and Applicant does\nnot contest that he was fired from his job in 2007 for taking company property, that he\ninitially lied to his boss about taking the property, and that he tried to conceal that\ninformation from the government by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 22 of his e-QIP.\nAvailable information raises security concerns about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct as\naddressed in AG\u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nApplicants are required to provide truthful answers at all times during the\ninvestigative and adjudicative process. Withholding relevant information about one\u2019s\nbackground can potentially impede the government\u2019s ability to make an accurate\ndecision about granting access to sensitive information. Applicant deliberately lied to his\nemployer about the fact he took the motor oil and he deliberately lied to the government\nwhen he answered \u201cno\u201d to e-QIP question 22. He concealed relevant information from\nhis e-QIP because he was embarrassed by the fact he had been fired from his previous\njob. These facts require application of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 16(a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities). Applicant\u2019s initial denial of his conduct when asked if he had taken the\nmotor oil requires application of the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer,\ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government\nrepresentative).\nI have also considered whether the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(d) (credible\nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not\nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\n\n6\nsafeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to consideration of:...(4)\nevidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time or resources) is\napplicable to Applicant\u2019s taking of the motor oil. Applicant\u2019s position is that he took the\noil home by mistake. However, he has not explained why he obtained three cases of oil\nwhen he knew the storage locker would only hold two. Also unexplained is why he put\nthe extra case of oil, for which he had no use, in his garage when he returned home if it\nwas a mistake and he intended to return it the next day. Also, if it was a mistake, why\ndid Applicant deny he had the oil when his boss asked him about it? Balanced against\nApplicant\u2019s version of events is a letter from his supervisor, who, although supportive of\nApplicant, makes clear that Applicant stole the motor oil. All of the information bearing\non this part of Applicant\u2019s conduct requires application of AG \u00b6 16(d).\nAs to the mitigating conditions with potential relevance here, he is not entitled to\nthe benefit of AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts). He\ninitially lied to his employer, who apparently knew there was a case of oil missing and\nasked Applicant directly whether he had taken it. As to his e-QIP, he may have been\nunable to correct his e-QIP owing to his remote work location immediately after he\nsubmitted the form. However, long before he returned home and was interviewed, he\ncould have alerted his boss and the FSO that he had made a false statement on his e-\nQIP. He did not do so until he became concerned that there may be a problem getting\nhis clearance. The foregoing undermines any benefit he might realize from the fact he\ncorrected his falsification during his interview.\nFinally, Applicant does not contest that he acted improperly in concealing his\nconduct at work and that he was fired. However, he avers his actions, while stupid, were\nisolated and not indicative of his judgment and reliability. I have considered the possible\napplication of AG \u00b6 16(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment). This mitigating condition is not applicable here because Applicant\u2019s\nconduct was recent. Nor was his offense minor, in that he violated the trust of a former\nemployer and failed to meet his obligation of candor when responding to the\ngovernment\u2019s questions. It was not infrequent because the record shows three\ninstances of deception and misconduct. Nor were the circumstances of his conduct\nunique \u2013 Applicant lied to his boss because he got caught and he lied on his e-QIP\nbecause he was embarrassed or was worried he would not get his clearance. On\nbalance, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns about his personal\nconduct raised by the government\u2019s information.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline E. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is a mature,\nresponsible, and accomplished 61-year-old defense contractor employee. Until this\nissue arose, he had held a security clearance without incident for nearly 30 years as\ncivilian employee of the Departments of the Navy and Army. Applicant has been a\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n7\nmodel of stability and reliability at work, in the military and at home, where he and his\nwife of 33 years raised a family. However, in 2007, he exhibited poor judgment and\ndishonesty on at least three occasions. He acknowledges his conduct and has taken\nresponsibility for it. His current employer is aware of his conduct, but still endorses\nApplicant as a fine employee suitable for a position of trust. Even the employer who\nfired him in 2007 provided a positive recommendation and endorsement of Applicant\u2019s\ncharacter. Nonetheless, this favorable information is insufficient to overcome the\nsecurity significance of Applicant\u2019s falsifications and his conduct at work. The personnel\nsecurity program is fundamentally reliant on the willingness of applicants to be honest,\nforthright and candid at all times in dealing with the government. Applicant\u2019s experience\nthrough his military career and as one who has held a security clearance throughout\nmuch of his adult life means he knew or should have known how important it was to be\nhonest about relevant information in his background. \nA fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information shows\n8\nApplicant has not overcome the doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the\ngovernment\u2019s interests as his own raised by the adverse information in his background.\nBecause protection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such\ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the government.9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nfor Applicant to have access to classified information.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 23, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On November 20, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.

Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on February 10, 2009. On February 11, 2009, the case was assigned to me. \nOn March 12, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice.  \n \nThe hearing was held on April 8, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1-4, which were received without objection. Applicant offered Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A-Y, which were received without objection. He testified and called eight \nwitnesses to testify on his behalf. I held the record open until April 17, 2009, to afford \nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional evidence.

At the time of the offense, Applicant\u2019s youngest daughter was intermittently living \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n        3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nwith him. His daughter came to live with him because, \u201c[s]he had become pregnant and \nher mother kicked her out of the house.\u201d Tr. 25.  \n \nAgainst Applicant\u2019s wishes, his daughter brought a dog into the house \u201caround \nJune of 2006.\u201d He opposed her bringing a dog into his home because of his busy \nschedule; he did not have time to train a dog; and he liked to \u201cpick [his] dogs very \ncarefully.\u201d He described himself as a dog and animal lover. Tr. 30. Applicant stated that \nonce the dog was in the house, his daughter would leave for days at a time and leave \nthe care of the dog to him. The dog was not house broken, not obedient, difficult to train, \nand destructive. Tr. 31-32. Tension over the dog built up, and on July 9, 2008, Applicant \ndiscovered the dog had torn his freshly-laundered clothes off the clothes line and \ndestroyed his only pair of dress pants. Tr. 33-34. \n \nAfter the dog tore his clothes off the line, he decided to put the dog down. \nApplicant added, \u201c[u]nfortunately it was a bad decision.\u201d Tr. 34. He explained that he \ngrew up on a family farm, and, as the oldest child, when an animal became a problem, it \nwas his responsibility to put it down. Tr. 34-35. He described the process of putting a \nproblem animal down as \u201cjust sort of a natural thing.\u201d Tr. 34. Applicant used a butcher \nknife to put the dog down. Believing the dog was dead, he began to clean up the blood. \nHe apparently was unsuccessful in putting the dog down, and the bleeding dog jumped \nover his fence into his neighbor\u2019s yard. Tr. 36-42. The neighbors called the police and \nApplicant was subsequently charged with two counts of cruel mistreatment of an animal. \nApplicant acknowledged he used poor judgment in trying to put the dog down in the \nmanner he did, and if he had to do it over again, he would take the dog to the pound. \nGE 4, Tr. 42-43. \n \nThere were a number of components included in Applicant\u2019s pre-trial agreement \nand subsequent sentence. GE 4. They are: \n \n(1) To serve three years supervised probation with no early termination. \nHis probation officer submitted a letter dated April 9, 2009, stating that \nApplicant is complying will all conditions of probation and has completed \nall classes as directed. His probation officer added that he is current on his \npayments to the court and is currently being supervised at the lowest level \nof supervision. AE II. Applicant last spoke to his probation officer by \ntelephone on January 2, 2009. Tr. 60-61; \n \n(2) To pay a $500 fine to the animal cruelty task force (see subparagraph \n(1) supra; \n \n(3) To undergo a psychiatric evaluation. The psychiatric evaluation was \ncompleted on March 14, 2007, shortly before Applicant appeared at his \nsentencing hearing on March 26, 2007. The evidence does not reflect any \nadverse information regarding Applicant\u2019s psychological condition.

Tr. \n66, AE II, AE GG. \n \nEight character witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. Three were work-\nrelated - a supervisory lead engineer, a supervisory laboratory manager and an \nengineer. Three other witnesses were from his church \u2013 a retired Air Force master \nsergeant and school district purchasing agent, a supervisor of state corrections \ndepartment background investigations, and a pharmaceutical sales representative. Two \nof his four children testified on his behalf, his oldest daughter and son. All work-related \nwitnesses were long-term employees with security clearances, and they interact with \nthe Applicant on a daily basis. His church witnesses were associated with Applicant \nprimarily when he served as Director of Children\u2019s Ministries and was responsible for \nthe religious education of 120 children. The collective sense gleaned from the witnesses \nis that Applicant is dependable, trustworthy, reliable, and honest. His son described him \nas a \u201cgood man.\u201d All of the witnesses favorably endorsed reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s \nclearance. Tr. 74-132. \n \nApplicant submitted 25 reference letters. The authors of the letters covered a full \nspectrum \u2013 work supervisors, co-workers, friends from church, and friends from his \ncommunity (a police officer, the senior pastor of his church, senior managers from work, \nfellow church members, members of the community, and two of his daughters). The \nvast majority of those submitting letters have known Applicant for a lengthy period of \ntime. All character references provided very favorable information about the Applicant \nconsistent with the witnesses who testified. AE A-Y.  \n \nAdditionally, many Sunday School parents spoke of Applicant\u2019s admirable \nperformance as Director of Children\u2019s Ministries and his years of selfless service in that \ncapacity.  \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted a character reference letter from his \nyoungest daughter \u2013 the daughter who introduced the dog into the household.

His \nwork performance evaluations for the last three years document sustained superior \nperformance and his contribution to the defense industry. AE DD-FF. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism.  \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n        6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline J (criminal conduct) with respect to the allegations set forth \nin the SOR. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d  \n \nApplicant admitted and the evidence established that he was convicted of two \nmisdemeanor counts of animal cruelty for an offense committed on July 9, 2006, \nwarranting application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b). \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n\n \n        7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is applicable given the two misdemeanor offenses for which Applicant \nwas convicted occurred three years ago. The record is void of any criminal involvement \nof any nature other than the incident in question. Although not an excuse or exoneration \nfor what happened, the animal cruelty offenses appear to have occurred during a \ndifficult transition period between Applicant and his youngest daughter. Applicant has \nexpressed sincere remorse for his lack of judgment. His actions were clearly contrary to \nhis otherwise above-board behavior and reputation in the community and at work. \n \nAG\u00b6\u00b6 32(b) and 32(c) do not apply. He admitted the two misdemeanor charges \nof animal cruelty and he was not pressured to commit such acts. \n \nAG \u00b6 partially applies. Applicant has complied with most of the terms of his \nprobation. He is current on payment of fines and restitution; he underwent a psychiatric \nevaluation; he does not have care, custody or control of any animal; he served 30 days \nin the county jail, which was under a work-release program; and he completed the \nhumane society\u2019s class in the proper care and training of pets. His probation officer \nconfirmed Applicant\u2019s compliance with probation and noted Applicant is being \nsupervised at the lowest level of supervision. There is also significant and substantial \nevidence of his good employment record and community involvement. He repeatedly \nexpressed remorse throughout his hearing and recognizes what he did was \ninappropriate and constituted unacceptable conduct regardless of his upbringing on a \nfarm. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \n\n \n        8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nunder Guideline J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting continued revocation of Applicant\u2019s \nclearance. He was a mature adult when he was convicted of two counts of \nmisdemeanor animal cruelty. Although he was challenged by the unruly behavior of an \nill-behaved dog and the failure of his daughter to exercise proper care and supervision \nof her dog, his attempt to put the dog down in the manner he did demonstrated very \npoor judgment. He was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct.  \n \nThe evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nHe pled guilty to two misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty and admitted his lack of \njudgment. He was sentenced and complied with most terms of his probation. Applicant\u2019s \nthree years of probation will be completed in March 2010. As noted by his probation \nofficer, Applicant is being supervised at the lowest level of supervision. In addition to \nwhat was required by the terms of probation, Applicant took the extra step of completing \na cognitive skills program offered by his probation department. \n \nHe has not been involved in any further misconduct or questionable behavior \nsince July 2006, a period of three years. He frankly and candidly accepted responsibility \nfor his acts. He informed his employer, church members, community members, and \nfamily members; and they showed substantial and collective support for him in spite of \nhis conduct.  \n \nApplicant has a 35-year flawless record and history of contributing to the national \ndefense through his Air Force and government contractor employment. Concomitant \nwith that service was his successfully holding a security clearance during that 35-year \nperiod. There is no evidence of any other disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of \ndisloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national security. His character and \nsuperb work performance show he is responsible, dependable and trustworthy. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to criminal conduct.  \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated and overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n        9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \nIn a response dated May 3, 2010, Applicant admitted all 10 allegations raised\nunder Guideline F and requested an administrative determination. On July 23, 2010,\nDepartment Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), which included nine\nattached items. Applicant did not submit any response or information within the time\nperiod of 30 days after his receipt of the FORM.  The case was assigned to me on\nNovember 2, 2010. Based on a review of the case file, submissions, and exhibits, I find\nApplicant failed to meet his burden regarding the security concerns raised. Security\nclearance denied.\nNovember 8, 2010\n\n Regarding the approximately $31,817 in Federal tax liability incurred for tax years 2002-2005, the IRS\n      1\nprepared substitute tax returns for Applicant.

He served in the United States military from 1972\nuntil 1992. He is a divorced father of two adult children and one minor child.\nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant provided scant information regarding his\npersonal life and finances. He admitted without explanation that his wages at a former\nemployer were garnished in about 2002 for approximately $8,400 in favor of the Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) because he had failed to pay voluntarily (SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a);\nthat he failed to file his Federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003-2008, as\nrequired (SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g); that he is indebted to the IRS for tax year 2003\nin the approximate amount of $4,259 and that the debt remained unpaid as of the April\n13, 2010, SOR (SOR allegation \u00b6 1.h); that he is indebted to the IRS for tax year 2004\nin the approximate amount of $13,983 and that the debt remained unpaid as of the April\n13, 2010, SOR (SOR allegation \u00b6 1.i); and that he is indebted to the IRS for tax year\n2005 in the approximate amount of $13,575 and that the debt remained unpaid as of\nthe April 13, 2010, SOR (SOR allegation \u00b6 1.j).1\nDuring a November 2007 interview regarding his security clearance application\n(SCA), Applicant admitted that he had not filed Federal tax returns for tax years 2003-\n2006. He claimed that the military had not supplied him with W-2 forms for his military\nretirement pay since 2003, but said he was addressing that issue by updating his\ncontact information with the military payment system and that he hoped \u201cto complete\nthe appropriate filing as soon as possible.\u201d  No evidence of any attempts to rectify this\n2\nsituation were submitted. \nIn June 2008, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant noted that he was\ngetting divorced from the spouse listed in his June 2005 security clearance application\n(SCA), and he provided the name of a child born abroad in 2006. He admitted he still\nhad not filed his Federal tax returns for tax years 2003-2006.

The AG lists potentially disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.\nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, they are applied in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An administrative judge\u2019s\nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under\nAG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nThe United States Government (Government) must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. It is an applicant\u2019s responsibility to\npresent  \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts\nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is\n6\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence. The ultimate burden of persuasion\nis on the applicant.  \n7\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to\npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n See also EO 12968, \u00a7 3.1(b)  and EO 10865 \u00a7 7.\n      8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      9\n Id.\n      10\n AG \u00b6 18.\n      11\n Id.\n      12\n4\napplicant concerned.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\n8\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt\n9\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting such information.  A security clearance denial does not\n10\nnecessarily reflect badly on an applicant\u2019s character. It is merely an indication that the\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nIn this case, Guideline F is the appropriate guideline for consideration. Under\nthat guideline, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  It also states\n11\nthat \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d  Here, Applicant admitted that he owes and has owed the IRS\n12\nan amount of approximately $31,817 for several years. He admitted his wages were\ngarnished in 2002 for approximately $8,400 for payment to the IRS. He also admitted\nhe failed to file Federal tax returns for tax years 2003 through 2008. Therefore,\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts), FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(g) (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income\ntax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same) apply. With such conditions\nraised, it is left to Applicant to overcome the case against him and mitigate security\nconcerns. \nApplicant failed to file Federal tax returns for tax year 2003, a pattern that\ncontinued through, at least, tax year 2008. There is no evidence this matter has been\naddressed. Applicant has not noted any continuing difficulties in updating his contact\ninformation with the military\u2019s payment system or in receiving his W-2 forms from the\nmilitary; he has not explained his delays in obtaining a Social Security number for a\nchild born in 2006; and has not provided a recent explanation for his continued delays\nin addressing the admitted SOR allegations. Financial Considerations Mitigating\nCondition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not\napply. \n\n Examination of the \u201cwhole-person\u201d in this matter is limited due to Applicant\u2019s failure to supplement the\n      13\nrecord with more personal information that might be relevant and material to this case.\n5\n Since November 2007, Applicant has not noted any further difficulties in\nmaintaining contact with the military pay system that might have protracted his ability to\nreceive W-2 forms or submit overdue tax returns. While Applicant may have had\ndifficulty obtaining a Social Security number for a child born in 2006, Applicant failed to\nexplain and document why that difficulty continued for several years. Moreover, while\nApplicant may have divorced within the past few years, no information was provided\nindicating it adversely impacted his ability to file or pay his Federal tax returns.\nTherefore, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) does not\napply.\nThere is no evidence Applicant has sought financial counseling or addressed his\nissues with the IRS, obviating application of FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control). Moreover, there is no evidence that\nApplicant has either paid or disputed the calculated tax liability for tax years 2003-2005,\nor attempted to file Federal tax returns for the remaining tax years at issue. Therefore,\nFC MC AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Given the limited facts provided, none of the\nother FC MCs apply.\nThe burden for mitigation in these proceedings is placed squarely on Applicant.\nLacking any evidence that he has made any progress on addressing any of the\nallegations noted in the SOR, financial considerations security concerns remain\nunmitigated.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the \u201cwhole-person concept,\u201d the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall\ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole-person concept. As noted above, the ultimate burden of persuasion is on the\napplicant seeking a security clearance. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors.  Applicant is a mature man who served in the U.S. military for 20 years. He has\n13\n\n6\nraised two children and is currently raising his minor child. He has been continuously\nemployed with the same employer for seven years. \nAlthough no documentary evidence was ever offered, Applicant stated that his\ndelays in filing Federal tax returns between, at least, 2003 and 2005, were based in part\non difficulty in obtaining W-2 forms from the military due to its not having current contact\ninformation for him. In 2008, he claimed his delays were based on difficulties in\nobtaining a Social Security number for a daughter born abroad in 2006. In November\n2009, he stated that after three years, he was still having problems getting the child\u2019s\nSocial Security number, while also claiming he was awaiting some unidentified\ninformation from the IRS. In May 2010, in response to the FORM, he admitted the\nallegations without comment. He did not timely respond to the July 23, 2010, FORM\nwith any additional information. Consequently, there is no explanation as to why these\nissues remain unaddressed. \nAs noted, with multiple disqualifying conditions raised, Applicant has the burden\nof raising mitigating conditions that would mitigate the financial considerations security\nconcerns raised. Applicant provided insufficient information that might tend to mitigate\nthose concerns. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. As noted above, any\nreasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting such information. In light of the\nforegoing, security concerns remain unmitigated. Clearance denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified\ninformation.

On November 7, 2008, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on December 3, 2008, in which\nhe elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on January 26, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information\nin rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on January 29, 2009, and he submitted no reply.  The case was assigned to the\nundersigned for resolution on March 26, 2009.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe FORM and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 33 years old.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with he\nemployment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  (Government Exhibit 3).  He is indebted to sixteen separate creditors totaling\napproximately $32,666.00.  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated September 27, 2007,\nMarch 14, 2008 and June 20, 2008, reflect that each of the debts remain owing.\n(Government Exhibits 5, 6 and 8).  He has not paid any of his debts.  \nAlthough the Applicant admits all of the debts in his answer to the SOR, he states\nin his Interrogatory Response that \u201cabout eight of the debts are not mine\u201d indicating that\nsome of the accounts belong his ex-wife.  (Government Exhibit 7).  He also provides\nsome documentation that certain debts have been removed from his credit report.\nThese debts, however, were not alleged in the SOR as outstanding.    \nApplicant attributes most of his financial problems to his ex-wife.  He states that\nshe opened accounts that he was not aware of and refused to pay.  He has not been\nable to work with a credit repair company because of the money he has had to spend\non attorney fees to get custody of his three children.  He now has custody of his three\nchildren and plans to resolve his delinquent debts as soon as possible.  (Government\nExhibit 7).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\n\n3\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\n\n4\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nWith respect to his finances, the Applicant remains excessively indebted in the\namount of $32,666.00.  Applicant states that his ex-wife caused most of his financial\nproblems but has provided no documentation, either of his efforts to resolve the debts,\nor from the creditors stating that he is not responsible for the debts.  He has therefore,\nnot shown why any of the mitigating conditions should apply.  Applicant has not\nprovided any documentation to show that any of his debts, even the small ones have\nbeen paid or are being paid off.  Nor has he fully set forth the reasons to lay blame for\nhis financial problems on his wife.  \nApplicant failed to reply to the FORM or submit any mitigating evidence.  He has\nfailed to provide a budget or payment plan to explain how his delinquent debts will be\npaid.  It is unclear from the record whether he understands the importance of financial\nmanagement.  A promise to take remedial measures in the future is not evidence of\nreform and rehabilitation.  There is no evidence in the record to demonstrate that he can\nmake his regular monthly payments in addition to making payments on his delinquent\n\n5\ndebts.  At the present time, he has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a\ntrack record of financial responsibility or that he has resolved his financial indebtedness.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nThere is no evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts and, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  None of the\nmitigating conditions apply.  His financial problems remain current and they are not\nisolated.  The Applicant has not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay his overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve his debts.   Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n6\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 30-year-old assembler (previously a security guard) for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant married his first spouse (W1) in November 2003 (see ex. 1). They have no children from their marriage and divorced in October 2006 (ex. 1). Applicant remarried in early 2007 (R.T., at 71), and has one son from this marriage (R.T., at 89). Applicant served three years in the U.S. Army between July 2001 and April 2004, and was deployed in 2003-2004 (R.T., at 72). He documents his honorable discharge from the Army (see ex. D). Albeit, he remains in the active Army Reserves (R.T., at 68, 72). Applicant accumulated a number of debts during his teenage and college years when he did not have steady work (see exs. 2 and 3; R.T., at 41). Some of them were small, and he was able to pay them off when he gained steady employment (see ex. A); R.T., at 42-43). He accumulated additional debts as well (some large and some small) that W1 failed to take care of during his military deployments (R.T., at 48-49, 74). These debts have not been resolved to date.

The case was assigned to me on February 18, 2009, and was scheduled for\nhearing on March 24, 2009.  A hearing was held as scheduled, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nApril 30, 2009\n\n2\nand 11 exhibits (AEs A-J).  The transcript (R.T.) was received March 31, 2009.  Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documented payments of two of his medical debts.  For good cause shown,\nApplicant was granted seven days to March 31, 2009 to supplement the record.  Within\nthe time permitted, Applicant provided copies of a transmission to a credit reporting\nagency and a bank account statement.  Department counsel did not object to the\nadmission of the submissions.  The submissions were admitted as exhibits K and L.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated 14 delinquent\ndebts exceeding $30,000.00 (including a student loan debt of $3,592.00). For his\nanswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the allegations. He admitted the debts\ncovered by subparagraphs 1.b, 1.f through 1.i, and 1.l through 1.n.  He denied the\nremaining six allegations, claiming he paid off some of the listed debts (creditors 1.c and\n1.d); he is unfamiliar with one creditor (creditor 1.e), and he disputed others (creditors\n1.j and 1.k).  Applicant claimed he is addressing his admitted debts.    \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 30-year-old assembler (previously a security guard) for a defense\ncontractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married his first spouse (W1) in November 2003 (see ex. 1).  They\nhave no children from their marriage and divorced in October 2006 (ex. 1).  Applicant\nremarried in early 2007 (R.T., at 71), and has one son from this marriage (R.T., at 89).\nApplicant served three years in the U.S. Army between July 2001 and April 2004, and\nwas deployed in 2003-2004 (R.T., at 72).  He documents his honorable discharge from\nthe Army (see ex. D).  Albeit,  he remains in the active Army Reserves (R.T., at 68, 72).\nApplicant accumulated a number of debts during his teenage and college years\nwhen he did not have steady work (see exs. 2 and 3; R.T., at 41).  Some of them were\nsmall, and he was able to pay them off when he gained steady employment (see ex. A);\nR.T., at 42-43).  He accumulated additional debts as well (some large and some small)\nthat W1 failed to take care of during his military deployments (R.T., at 48-49, 74).\nThese debts have not been resolved to date.\nApplicant\u2019s three largest debts encompass back rent owed to a landlord while\nApplicant was deployed, a student loan debt, and a deficiency owed on a repossessed\n\n3\nvehicle.  The landlord (creditor 1.a) seeks $3,392.00 in back rent, which Applicant has\nbeen unable to pay or resolve to date.  While Applicant was deployed, W1 took care of\ntheir monthly bills.  When he returned from deployment, he learned that W1 had not\npaid the scheduled monthly rent and had received an eviction notice from the landlord\n(R.T., at 48-49).  He has since talked to the landlord about paying part of this debt\nthrough a payment plan, but his offer was declined (R.T., at 49).\nApplicant\u2019s student loan debt (creditor 1.g which has a listed balance of\n$3,592.00) originated in 1998 and went into default status.  He made several $100.00\npayments in 2007 and early 2008 before stopping his payments altogether (R.T., at 78-\n79).  In December 2008, the creditor (creditor 1.g) initiated wage garnishment (see exs.\n2, G, I and J; R.T., at 52-54, 79 ).  His wages are being garnished at the rate of $77.00\na week (R.T., at 79-80), and he has no time estimates for when this debt will be fully\nsatisfied.\n Applicant\u2019s other large debt (his debt to creditor 1.k) represents a deficiency\nbalance on a repossessed vehicle in the amount if $14,200.00.  In 2004, Applicant fell\nbehind in his car payments and voluntarily returned the vehicle to the seller (R.T., at 65-\n66).   He has made no progress, to date, in paying off this deficiency balance. \nWhile Applicant has been able to pay off two small medical accounts (creditors\n1.c and 1.d), he has made negligible progress in the payment of his other listed\ncreditors (R.T., at 89).  He hopes to be able to address his largest debts after he pays\noff his more numerous smaller accounts (R.T., at 57-59).  \nApplicant has not sought any financial counseling to date and has made no\ndocumented voluntary payments on most of his listed debts (R.T., at 93-94).  Except for\nthe two small debts (creditors 1.c and 1.d) and the continuing garnishment of his pay by\nhis student loan creditor, Applicant has not made any documented headway in\naddressing his listed debts.  He continues to await return calls from some of the small\ncreditors he recently contacted to explore payment arrangements (R.T., at 69).  But to\ndate, most of the creditors he contacted are not willing to set up payment plans with him\n(R.T., at 69-70, 81-82).\nApplicant estimates he takes home approximately $700.00 a month from his civil\nemployment and another $280.00 a month from his monthly drill meetings (R.T., at 83-\n84).  After paying his rent and necessities, he estimates he has a net monthly remainder\nof no more than $100.00 a month (R.T., at 87).\nAfforded an opportunity to address his outstanding debts, Applicant failed to\nprovide any tangible evidence of his resolving his listed debts.  He did provide a March\n2009 letter to a credit reporting agency containing disputes of four of his creditors.  It is\nnot clear, though, whether any of these covered creditors match any of his listed\ncreditors.  Still unresolved are the delinquent debts covered by creditors 1.a and 1.b and\ncreditors 1.e through 1.n.  That some of these named creditors no longer appear on\nApplicant\u2019s latest credit report is insufficient in and of itself to credit Applicant with\n\n4\nresolution of the debts.  Each of these debts are reported in Appellant\u2019s 2006 and 2008\ncredit reports (see exs. 3 and 4).  \nApplicant earned a number of awards and commendations during his military\nservice enlistment (ex. E).  His promotion and worksheet shows a number of points\nawarded (ex. F).  By all accounts, he is a responsible husband of W2 and parent of his\nyoung son. \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d  Adjudication Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\n\n5\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a responsible employee of a defense contractor who accumulated a\nnumber of delinquent debts before and during his marriage to his first wife.  Applicant is\nunable to document his voluntary addressing of any of his listed debts.  Altogether, all\nbut three of his listed creditors remain unaddressed and unresolved.  Besides the two\nsmall creditors he is credited with paying (creditors 1.c and 1.d), only his student loan\nindebtedness reflects any payment activity, and the weekly collection of this debt is the\nresult of instituted involuntary garnishment action.  \nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\ndelinquent debts and his past inability to pay these debts warrant the application of two\nof the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines DC \u00b6 19(a), inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts, and \u00b619(c)) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to his divorce from W1 and his ensuing\ninability to identify and address his listed delinquent accounts.  Faced with so many\npressing challenges to manage a new family, and still manage the responsibilities he\nfaces with his new spouse and young son, Applicant has struggled somewhat to keep\nup.  His progress to date in regaining control of his finances is still a work in progress\nthat has been scarcely addressed to date.  His finances remain clouded by numerous\nunresolved debts that require a good deal of effort on Applicant\u2019s part to fully stabilize\nthem. \n\n6\nBased on his evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are insufficient to establish\nany material extenuating circumstances.  As a result, he is not in a position to invoke\nMC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibility.\u201d \nMitigation credit is not available to Applicant either based on the facts of this case.\nNeither Applicant\u2019s oral or written proofs reflect any initiated voluntary repayment efforts\nin his behalf on most of his listed debts.  Only a very recent written dispute filed with his\ncredit reporting agency reflects any tangible action on his still unresolved debts.  And this\ndispute letter does not unmistakably address any listed debt in the SOR.  The only\nvisible action taken on Applicant\u2019s debts to date are his own voluntary payments of his\ncreditor 1.c and 1.d debts and the enforcement measures undertaken by Applicant\u2019s\nstudent lender. This being involuntary enforcement action, it can not qualify as a good-\nfaith repayment effort in Applicant\u2019s behalf.  So, based on his very limited payment\nefforts to date, Applicant may not take advantage of any of the remaining mitigating\nconditions covered in the financial guideline.      \n                                             \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the judgment\nquestions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debts.  Since his divorce from W1\nand remarriage to W2, Applicant has not shown enough tangible effort in addressing  his\ncovered debts to mitigate his still delinquent debts and credit him with restored control\nover his finances.\nWhile Applicant provided some documentation of exhibited good judgment and\ntrust in his work, he provided no endorsements from his supervisors, and a very limited\nperformance evaluation, and/or other evidence of his company contributions to\ndemonstrate his trust and reliability with his employer. In balance, whole person\nassessment does not enable Applicant to establish judgment and trust levels sufficient to\nenable him to overcome appraised security concerns arising out his accumulation of\ndelinquent debts.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources he has had to address them with,\nthe limited steps he has mounted to address his old debts, it is still too soon to make\nsafe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his debts and restore his\nfinances to stable levels commensurate with his holding a security clearance.\n\n7\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b and 1.e through 1.n.  Favorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a and 1.b:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSub-paras. 1.c and 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSub-paras. 1.e through 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on August 1, 2007 (Item 3).  On November 20, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant \ndetailing security concerns for financial considerations under Guideline F (Item 1).  The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 17, 2008, admitting 14 and \ndenying five of the 19 allegations in the SOR (Items 2).  She elected to have the matter \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on February 10, 2009.  Applicant received a complete file of \nrelevant material (FORM) on February 23, 2009, and was provided the opportunity to \nfile objections, and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions.  Applicant did not respond to the FORM or provide additional material.  The \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \ncase was assigned to me on April 27, 2009.  Based on a review of the case file and \npleadings, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI thoroughly reviewed the case file, and the pleadings.  I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and has been employed as a data processing specialist \nfor a defense contractor since July 2007.  She is married with two children.  This \nappears to be her first request for a security clearance (Item 3).  There is no information \nin the file concerning salary, expenses, or disposable funds.  She reports steady \nemployment since February 2000, except for a five month period when she was \nunemployed to take care of her mother (Item 3)  \n \nCredit reports and the SOR list the following delinquent debts: a charged off \naccount with First Premier for $463 (SOR 1.a); an account in collection for Arrow \nServices for $339 (SOR 1.b); a charged off account for Capital One for $2,017 (SOR \n1.c); a collection account for AT&T by Palisades for $258 (SOR 1.d); a charged off \naccount for Swiss Colony for $85 (SOR 1.e); a collection account for Verizon for $701 \n(SOR 1.f); a Verizon account in collection for $638 (SOR 1.g); a medical account in \ncollection for $90 (SOR 1.h); an account for Bank of American in collection by NCO \nFinancial for $253 (SOR 1.i); a charged off account for First Premier for $267 (SOR 1.j); \na charged off account for Triadfincl for $8,123 (SOR 1.k); a medical collection account \nfor $28 (SOR 1.l); a charged off account for HSBC for $759 (SOR1.m); a mortgage \nforeclosure debt of $2,300 for AMC Mrtg Services (SOR 1.n); medical accounts in \ncollection for $39 (SOR 1.o), $35 (SOR 1.p), $29 (SOR 1.q), and $741 (SOR 1.r); and a \ncollection account for Bank America by NCO Financial for $279 (SOR 1.s; See Item 1, \nSOR; Item 4, Credit Report, dated September 1, 2008; and Item 5, Credit Report, dated \nAugust 15, 2007).  It appears the two First Premier accounts (SOR 1.a and 1.j) are the \nsame debt.  It appears the two collection accounts for Bank of America (SOR 1.i and \n1.s) are the same accounts.  It appears the collection accounts for Verizon (SOR 1.f and \n1.g) are the same debt.  The total debt, without the duplications, is for 16 debts totaling \n$16,207. \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts at SOR 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, \n1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.s.  She provided no explanation for the \ndebts or any action she has taken to pay the debts.  She denied the debts at SOR 1.b, \n1.c, 1.e, 1.i, and 1.n.  The only explanation provided was that she was unaware of the \ndebt (Item 2).   \n \nIn response to interrogatories, Applicant stated she never ordered any item or \nmade a purchase from the mail order house listed at SOR 1.e.  She presented no \ninformation on any correspondence she had with the company concerning the debt.  \nShe also stated she intends to file a petition in bankruptcy but the filing has been \ndelayed.  She realizes her credit reports show a negative financial history, but she is not \n\n \n3 \n \n \na worthless person but trusting, hardworking and reliable.  Her credit report does not \nreflect her true worth.  She would never do anything to harm her country (Items 6 and 7, \nAnswers to Interrogatories).   \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts as established by credit reports and \nApplicant's admissions to most of the debts raise Financial Considerations Disqualifying \nConditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).  The record from credit \nreports and responses to interrogatories shows her inability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts and shows a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).  Applicant has taken no action to \npay the delinquent debts, so the debts are current.  The debts are from various sources, \ncredit cards, loans, phone bills, and a mortgage, so they are not infrequent.  Since the \ndebts are current and not paid, they cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  The mitigating condition does not apply. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  Applicant admits to 14 of the 19 \ndebts without an explanation.  Of the five she denied, she only states that she was \nunaware of the debts.  Applicant has been steadily employed for the last nine years \nexcept for five months.  She presented no information concerning any attempt to pay \npast due obligations when she has been steadily employed.  She has not established \nshe acted responsibly in managing her finances and making payments on her \nobligations. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\".  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant presented no information to show she has a plan to pay the debts or any \naction that she has taken to pay her debts.  Applicant appears to have sufficient income \nto make some payments on her delinquent debts since she has been steadily employed \nfor over nine years.  She has not presented a concrete plan to pay her delinquent debts \nor established any attempt to pay them.  While bankruptcy is a legal and permissible \nmeans of resolving financial issues, a future intention to file a bankruptcy is not an \nindication of a good-faith effort to pay debts.  Applicant has not presented sufficient \ninformation to indicate a good-faith effort to pay creditors or resolve debts.  Her finances \nare not under control and she has not acted responsibly.  She has not presented \nsufficient information to mitigate security concerns for financial considerations. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant has not taken action to resolve her past due debts.  Her indifferent \nattitude, her failure to contact creditors, and her lack of actions show she is not \ntrustworthy, responsible, or that she exercises good judgment.  Applicant has been \nirresponsible towards her delinquent debts and financial obligations.  This is an \nindication that she might be irresponsible towards the protection and handling of \nclassified information.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \narising from her finances.  Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant (Duplicate) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant (Duplicate) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant (Duplicate) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). Applicant mitigated the security concerns \nbased on his financial history and refuted the allegation of falsifying his security \nclearance application. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on August 11, \n2004. On November 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to \ndeny his application, citing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nApril 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on November 14, 2008; answered it on November \n28, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on December 1, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nDecember 31, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on February 10, 2009. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on February 18, 2009, scheduling the hearing for March 17, \n2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 8 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through X, which were admitted without objection. \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until March 31, 2009, to enable \nhim to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX Y through HH, \nwhich were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 25, \n2009. The record closed on March 31, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the mortgage foreclosure alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, but he denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a that he falsified his SF 86. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old engineer technician employed by a federal contractor. \nHe served on active duty in the U.S. Army for 21 years and retired as a sergeant first \nclass (pay grade E-7). His service included two tours of duty in combat zones. (AX B.) \nWhile on active duty, he obtained an associate\u2019s degree from a state university. He \nreceived consistently strong evaluation reports for his performance of duty as a \nnoncommissioned officer. (AX C.) He has held a clearance since March 1982. \n \nApplicant began working for his current employer in December 2003, shortly after \nhis retirement from the Army. His annual performance assessment for his current job for \nthe year ending in July 2006 rated him as exceeding expectations in three of seven \nperformance areas and meeting expectations in the others. (AX A.)  \n \n \nApplicant was married in June 1983, and he has an eight-year-old daughter from \nthat marriage. He and his wife purchased property in a rural, mountainous area, where \nhe built a log cabin as a vacation home. With the help of friends, he did much of the \nbuilding himself, including felling the logs and taking them to the wood mill. (Tr. 91.) The \nexterior of the home was substantially completed in 2000. He hoped to live in the cabin \nafter retirement, but his wife did not share his desire. Initially, there was no mortgage on \nthe property, but he and his wife used the property as collateral for a loan of about \n$68,000, which they used to purchase their primary home. (Tr. 67-70.) \n \n \nIn August 2003, Applicant returned from an eight-month deployment to Iraq and \ndiscovered his wife had been having an affair. His wife told him the affair was over, but \nshe would not disclose the identity of her paramour. They argued about the affair \nfrequently. During an argument on April 30, 2004, Applicant lost his temper and struck \nher once on the side of her face. Their daughter, who was then three years old, \nwitnessed the incident. Immediately after the incident, Applicant and his daughter left \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe house and walked around for about 30 minutes. After he and his daughter returned, \nthe police came to his house in response to his wife\u2019s call. He initially refused to admit \nthe police until he could talk to his wife, but he eventually admitted them. They arrested \nhim and charged him with reckless endangerment, resisting arrest, terroristic threats, \nassault, and endangering the welfare of a child. He spent four or five days in jail \nbecause he could not post bail. (GX 3, GX 7.) \n \n \nOn August 5, 2004, Applicant was arraigned, pleaded not guilty, and requested a \njury trial. In October 2004, he pleaded nolo contendere to charges of resisting arrest \nand reckless endangerment, and he was placed on probation before judgment for 18 \nmonths. He was prohibited from having any contact with his wife or daughter during the \nprobationary period, and he was required to attend domestic intervention counseling. \nHe completed the counseling in February 2005. (GX 8.)  \n \nApplicant and his wife separated in May 2004 and were divorced in August 2005. \n(AX V.) From May 2004 until May 2005, he was required to pay all of his wife\u2019s living \nexpenses, including the mortgage payments on both properties. (AX J, EE, FF; Tr. 78-\n79, 81.) His wife was awarded 55% of his military retired pay, reducing his monthly \ngross retired pay from $1,730 to $690. (GX 2 at 4, 15; AX W at 9.) He also was ordered \nto pay child support of $612 per month. In May 2008, his child support obligation was \nrecalculated by the court and adjusted downward to $517 per month, and he received a \nrefund for the months of February through June 2008. (GX 2 at 5.) In June 2008, the \nstate erroneously garnished his civilian pay for child support, even though the child \nsupport was being automatically withheld from his military retired pay. (GX 2 at 15-17.) \n \nApplicant made payments on the vacation home mortgage for about two years, \nusing his military retired pay; but his loss of more than half of his military retired pay \nmade it impossible for him to keep up the payments. Until the final divorce decree and \nproperty settlement, he was trying to pay the mortgage on the primary home, occupied \nby his wife and daughter, pay the mortgage on the vacation home, and pay the rent for \nhis own residence. He contacted the lender for the vacation home and tried to work out \na loan modification, but he was unsuccessful because his payments were not current. \n(Tr. 71; AX BB, CC.) In an effort to raise funds, he sold two trucks that were completely \npaid for. He also sold his motorcycle, and used the proceeds to pay off the loan for it. \n(Tr. 74-75; AX GG, HH.) He and an Army friend started cutting wood and power-\nwashing decks to generate extra money. (Tr. 79.) \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant listed the vacation home for sale, with an asking price \nof $100,000. (GX 2 at 6). The property was appraised at $82,000. (AX S.) In February \n2008, he reduced the price to $75,000. (GX 2 at 9.) His realtor advised him that the \nproperty was difficult to sell because construction was incomplete and the house was \ndeteriorating from being unoccupied and incomplete. (AX R). The mortgage holder \nforeclosed on February 20, 2008. The value of the property ($72,324) was sufficient to \nsatisfy the outstanding balance on the mortgage ($66,422). (AX Q, DD.) His credit \nbureau report dated June 24, 2008 reflects a zero balance on the loan. (GX 5 at 2.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant is now current on all obligations. He has one active credit card with a \nbalance of about $1,300. He has paid off the loans on a 2004 car and a 1989 truck. He \nhas about $4,000 in a money market account, $350 in his bank account, and $3,000 in \nhis retirement fund with his current employer. (Tr. 75-76.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a SF 86 in January 2004 (AX G, H.); and he resubmitted it \non August 11, 2004. He did not disclose his arrest arising from the domestic incident \nwhen he resubmitted his SF 86, nor did he disclose that the charges based on that \nincident were pending. (GX 1.) However, shortly after the incident, he informed his \nsupervisor and a member of his personnel office that he had been involved in a \ndomestic violence incident. (Tr. 59, 62, 65-66; AX Z, AA.) He disclosed the incident in \ndetail in a handwritten sworn statement submitted to a security investigator on \nDecember 6, 2004. (GX 3.) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied intentionally falsifying his SF 86. He admitted \nexecuting the signature page of his SF 86 on August 11, 2004; but he did not recall \nseeing his negative answers to the questions regarding his police record and pending \ncharges. (Tr. 54, 57-58.) His explanation was that he probably signed the document \nwithout reading it carefully. (Tr. 64-65.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a delinquent debt of about $70,000 on a real estate mortgage \nthat was foreclosed. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nTwo potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised where there is an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised \nwhen there is Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.@ Applicant\u2019s financial history \nraises these two conditions, shifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established because the \ndelinquent mortgage was not resolved until recently. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) \nand third prong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d), however, are established. Applicant did not have a \nhistory of delinquent debts until the break-up of his marriage and the resulting financial \nburdens imposed on him. The effects of his former wife\u2019s infidelity and the marital break-\nup are not likely to recur. His finances are now in order and under control. The final \nprong (\u201cdoes not cast doubt\u201d) also is established. His responsible reaction to his \nfinancial problems and his current financial stability have overcome any reasonable \ndoubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(a) is established.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. The break-up of Applicant\u2019s \nmarriage was beyond his control. As noted above in the discussion of AG \u00b6 20(a), he \nreacted responsibly to his financial situation. I conclude this mitigating condition is \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Applicant contacted his mortgage lender \nand attempted to negotiate a resolution. He sold his two trucks and a motorcycle. He \ntook on a second job in an effort to raise money. Even though the mortgage was \neventually foreclosed, he demonstrated good faith in his efforts to avoid foreclosure. \nThe debt has been satisfied, eliminating his vulnerability to pressure or coercion. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his arrest arising from \nthe domestic violence incident and deliberately failed to disclose that the charges based \non that incident were still pending when he submitted his SF 86. The concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is set out in AG \u00b6 16(a) as \nfollows: \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant denied intentionally omitting the information regarding his arrest, but \nhis only explanation was that he probably overlooked the omission when he signed the \nSF 86. Such an explanation might not be credible without corroboration, but in this case \nit is corroborated by Applicant\u2019s disclosure of the domestic violence incident to his \nsupervisor and a member of his personnel office shortly after it happened and his \ndetailed disclosure to a security investigator less than three months after he submitted \nhis SF 86.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted his SF 86 a few days after his arraignment and while in the \nmiddle of a bitter divorce. He was still recovering from the shock of discovering his wife \nof 22 years had been unfaithful during his deployment to Iraq and struggling to deal with \nthe financial consequences of his marital break-up. Under these circumstances, his \ninattention to the accuracy of his SF 86 is plausible. Applicant presented himself at the \nhearing as candid and very sincere, but somewhat unsophisticated. Under all the \ncircumstances, I am satisfied that Applicant did not intentionally omit relevant and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmaterial information from his SF 86. Accordingly I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is not \nraised. No other potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline are raised. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant served honorably in the U.S. Army for 21 years and held a clearance \nduring most of his service, apparently without incident. The conduct raising security \nconcerns was the product of his wife\u2019s unfaithfulness, the disintegration of his marriage \nof 22 years, and the loss of his dream of retiring to live in his mountain cabin. He has \nrebounded from these setbacks and is debt free. His broken marriage is behind him.  \n \n \nAlthough it was not alleged in the SOR, I have also considered Applicant\u2019s act of \ndomestic violence as part of my whole person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (uncharged misconduct may be considered as part of \nwhole person analysis). The evidence of record reflects that this incident was an \nisolated incident, triggered by his wife\u2019s infidelity and the break-up of his marriage, and it \nis not likely to recur.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on his financial difficulties and he \nhas refuted the allegation of falsifying his SF 86. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried \nhis burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nhis eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant accumulated multiple delinquent debts over the past six years for a\nvariety of reasons. After they were placed for collection, and when the collection\nagencies would not negotiate reduced settlement amounts, Applicant decided not to pay\nthem and just wait until they dropped off his credit report. He entered a debt\nconsolidation plan the day before his hearing, with an initial $485 payment toward the\n$14,136 in consolidated debt. He has not yet established a meaningful track record of\nresolving his delinquent debt. Based upon a thorough review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on April 13, 2007. On October 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security\nconcerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nApril 23, 2009\n\n2\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 17, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on November 24, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 5,\n2009, and DOHA assigned the case to me on the following day.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 4, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on February 24, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf, and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through K, which were also\nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March\n4, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked\nfor four years as a logistics specialist. He was married from 1984 to 1989, and married\nhis current wife later in 1989. He has five children, the youngest of whom is 18 and the\nonly one still living with Applicant. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted to 10 of the 21\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.u. On May 28, 2008, Applicant responded to DOHA\nInterrogatories under oath, and affirmed the accuracy of the contents of the report of his\ninterview, conducted by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator on July\n23, 2007. All of Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in the following findings. \nApplicant enlisted in the Air Force in March 1982 and served on active duty until\nOctober 1994. Since then he has served in the Active Reserves. He has held a security\nclearance since 1982, without any adverse security incidents. In 1990, largely as a\nresult of his divorce, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief and his debts were\ndischarged. His present delinquent debt started to accrue in 2002. Applicant\u2019s family\nwas then living in a different state from where he was working, and he only came home\non weekends. His wife did not pay some of their bills, and he discovered this when\nsome collection notices started arriving. (GE 1; Tr. at 56-60, 66-72.)\nApplicant sought advice from a financial counselor, who advised him that once\nthe debts had gone into collection status, the damage to his credit score was already\ndone and repaying them would not improve that score. He tried unsuccessfully to\nnegotiate reductions in the interest and fees being claimed by the debt collectors. He\ntold the OPM investigator that he decided not to pay the debts since the creditors and\ncollection agencies would not work with him, and he would just wait seven years for\nthem to drop off his credit bureau reports (CBRs). The six delinquencies from 2002 that\nremain unpaid are listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.n, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.r, totaling $6,026. (GE 2\nat 3; GE 3-7 (CBRs); Tr. at 24-29, 36, 41, 48, 71-73.) \nApplicant demonstrated that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q, 1.s, and 1.t, are\nduplicate CBR listings of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.o, and 1.n, respectively. He\n\n3\nfurther demonstrated that he successfully disputed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, and\n1.l, which have been removed from his 2009 CBRs. Finally, he proved that he settled\nand paid the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, and 1.m, for reduced amounts in November\n2003, and May 2007, respectively. (AE B; AE C; AE D; AE F; AE G; GE 5 at 2; Tr. at\n24-27, 30-35, 37-38, 44-46, 49.)\nAlthough Applicant testified that he has been paying all his debts recently, the\nCBRs reflect that seven of his outstanding debts became delinquent between 2003 and\n2008. These debts, with amounts owed and dates of last activity are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a ($266/Apr. 2007), 1.c ($200/Aug. 2007), 1.d ($100/Jun 2007), 1.f ($206/Jan. 2004),\n1.g ($189 past due Jan. 2008, total owed $1,490), 1.h ($390 past due Nov. 2005, total\nowed $1,392), and 1.k ($511/Aug. 2003). (GE 3-7; Tr. at 38-43, 47, 77-78, 82-83.)\nAlthough he told the OPM investigator that he had no intention of repaying any of\nhis delinquent debts during his July 2007 interview, he received some additional\ncounseling from an Air Force legal assistance attorney concerning the risks associated\nwith that course of action and decided to seek assistance from a credit counseling and\ndebt consolidation service to resolve his debts. On February 23, 2009, the day before\nhis hearing, Applicant entered into a debt management plan agreement consolidating\n$14,136 in debts, some of which were not previously delinquent but may become so\nunder the plan\u2019s distribution of payments. The plan includes the 13 SOR-listed\ndelinquent debts noted above (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, k, n, o, p, and r), with a current\ntotal balance of $10,341. The agreement calls for Applicant to pay $485 to start, and\n$460 per month thereafter for 38 months. It also requires him to undergo a financial\neducation course. Upon completion of the agreement in April 2012, the 26 debts in the\nplan will be repaid. (GE 2 at 3, 7, 8; AE A; Tr. at 21-24, 73-74.)  \nApplicant and his wife, who recently resumed employment, make sufficient\nincome to meet these debt management plan payments and their other living expenses\nwithout incurring additional debt. It is their present intention to resolve their outstanding\ndelinquencies and remain financially responsible in the future. He is pending promotion\nto paygrade E-9 in the Air Force Reserve, and his military performance reports reflect\noutstanding evaluations, especially since 2002. He was awarded a Meritorious Service\nMedal for his performance of reserve duties from March 2002 to June 2003, and was\nnominated for Wing Senior NCO of the Quarter in May 2004. Former military\ncommanders and supervisors wrote him strong letters of recommendation for positions\nhe was seeking in 2004 and 2007, and his current civilian supervisor provided a strong\nendorsement of his work performance and character. (AE H - K; Tr. at 59-66, 74-75.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\n5\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government evidence raised two of these\npotentially disqualifying conditions: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and\n\u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant openly expressed his\nunwillingness to satisfy a number of his delinquent debts as recently as his July 2007\nOPM interview, and despite earning what he claims to be more than sufficient money to\ncover present living expenses, two of his SOR-listed debts became delinquent after that\ninterview. He successfully disputed two debts formerly listed on his CBRs, and settled\ntwo other debts. However, he still carries substantial delinquent debt that he will not fully\nrepay until April 2012 under his current plan. Accordingly, Applicant has demonstrated\nboth present inability and recent unwillingness to satisfy debts, raising concerns under\nAG \u00b6 19(a). He also has a lengthy history of not meeting financial obligations, starting\nwith a bankruptcy discharge in 1990. Six debts totaling more than $6,000 became\ndelinquent in 2002, when Applicant\u2019s wife stopped competently handling their finances.\nThese debts remain unpaid, and another seven SOR-listed debts totaling over $4,000\nbecame delinquent from 2003 to 2008. His consolidated debt management plan covers\nmore than $14,000 in present debt, some of which will remain unpaid for the next three\nyears. This history supports security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(c). Applicant\u2019s pattern of\nunwillingness and inability to pay his debts, resulting in his lengthy history of not\nmeeting financial obligations, raises substantial questions about his self-control,\njudgment, and willingness to abide by rules and regulations under which people are\nexpected to fulfill their lawful obligations.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from a\nhistory of unpaid debt and financial irresponsibility. The five potentially pertinent\nconditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n6\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant\u2019s presently delinquent debts arose over a six-year period and 13 of\nthose debts listed in the SOR remain delinquent to date. His 1990 bankruptcy was 19\nyears ago, and largely caused by a divorce that there is no indication might recur.\nApplicant established mitigation of concerns about this bankruptcy under AG \u00b6 20(a),\nbut concerns about his more recent delinquent debts and until recently, his refusal to\naddress them are not mitigated under that provision and cast doubt on his current good\njudgment and trustworthiness. Applicant also established mitigation concerning his 1990\nbankruptcy under AG \u00b6 20(b), since it was divorce-related. However, his post 2002\ndebts all arose while he was happily married, fully employed, and had no reason not to\nact more responsibly toward them. \nApplicant entered a debt management plan on the day before his hearing and\nmade one $485 payment toward the $14,136 in covered debts. Financial counseling is\nalso part of this program, thereby beginning to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c)\nand (d). However, in light of his six years of express and conscious refusal to address\nmost of these debts, and last minute action under imminent threat of losing his security\nclearance, the degree to which this effort can be considered in good faith is\nquestionable. In ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal\nBoard recently discussed an applicant\u2019s burden of proof under these mitigating factors:\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). However, an applicant is not\nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u201c . . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can\nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and\nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the\nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a)(\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\n\n7\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd.\nApr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually\npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the\nSOR.\nApplicant did establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) concerning the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, and 1.m, by negotiating and paying settlements of the debts involved. He\nestablished mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(e) for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, and 1.l,\nwhich he successfully disputed and caused to be removed from his CBRs. He also\ndemonstrated that no independent security concerns arise under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q, 1.s, and\n1.t, since those allegations reflect duplicate listings of the outstanding delinquencies\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.o, and 1.n. \n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves his recent history of financial irresponsibility that began in 2002 and\ncontinued through 2008. His professional performance in active and reserve Air Force\nservice and as a defense contractor has been exemplary. The amount of his delinquent\ndebt is not terribly large compared to his resources, but reflected his conscious choice,\nuntil very recently, to ignore collection efforts and refuse to address the debts in the\nabsence of concessions by his creditors. A substantial amount of delinquent debt\nremains outstanding, despite his having been employed by defense contractors and the\n\n8\nAir Force Reserve throughout this period. He very recently entered a debt consolidation\nand management program that should resolve his outstanding debts by April 2012 if he\nfollows through with the plan. Having only made the one initial $485 payment under the\nplan to date, it is too early to conclude with any confidence that he will do so in light of\nthe previous six years of intentional refusal to address them. The potential for coercion\nor duress remains unchanged as he has yet to achieve substantial reduction in the\nnumber or amount of these debts. His plan will not achieve such reductions for several\nyears, during which time security concerns will continue.\nOn balance, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to fully mitigate judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness security concerns arising from his recent unwillingness\nand present inability to satisfy his debts, and his history of not meeting financial\nobligations. By demonstrating a sufficient period of compliance with, or acceleration of,\nhis debt management plan, such concerns can be mitigated in the foreseeable future\ngiven the length and quality of his service to the national defense. At present, however,\nthe record evidence leaves substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns arising from his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nOn December 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines J and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 22, 2009 and February 19, \n2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned \nto me on March 26, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April 7, 2009. I \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on May 7, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 9. Applicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified \nand offered Exhibits (AE) A through E. The Government did not object and they were \nadmitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 18, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, except \u00b6 2.b. His admissions \nto the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact. \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old and retired from the Navy in 2000, in the rank of E-7. He \nwas married in 1986 and has three children, a daughter age 21, and two sons, ages 14 \nand 11. He and his wife divorced in December 2007. He held a security clearance while \nhe was in the Navy.1  \n \nApplicant stated that while in the Navy he participated in four highly classified \nspecial missions while deployed on a submarine. He stated the missions were vital to \nnational security. He stated personnel from the U.S. intelligence agencies and National \nSecurity Agency were on the missions. He explained the missions were very stressful.2 \n \n \nIn 2004 Applicant was working for a federal contractor. In August 2004, a \ncomplaint was made with the police department by Applicant\u2019s then 15 year old \ndaughter that he had molested her. With his attorney, Applicant turned himself in to the \npolice in September 2004 and was charged with four felony charges of indecent liberties \nwith a minor. The allegations were that Applicant molested his daughter by asking her to \nundress and then masturbating while he looked at her. The allegations also stated that \nin July 2004 Applicant pulled open his daughter\u2019s shirt and touched her breast beneath \nher bra.3 Applicant was charged with indecent liberties with a minor, specifically as the \ncustodial parent by having his daughter expose her breasts and then on separate \noccasions touching her breasts both outside and inside her shirt. Applicant pled guilty to \nthe two charges of touching his daughter.4 \n \n \nIn April 2005, Applicant was found guilty and sentenced to incarceration for a \nterm of five years for each offense, a total of ten years. The court suspended nine years \nand imposed supervised probation and required sexual offender treatment and \ncounseling. Applicant served his sentence and was released from jail in March 2006. He \nstated he is on supervised probation until 2015. He reports to his probation officer once \n \n1 Tr. 34-35. \n \n2 Tr. 26. \n \n3 Tr. 27; GE 2. \n \n4 Tr. 38-48; GE 3. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \na month; is subject to home visits and has to take a polygraph every six months. He has \npassed his polygraphs. He is required to register as a sex offender and update his \nregistry every three months or it is a violation of his probation.5  \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant denied he ever touched his daughter\u2019s breasts. He \nstated his attorney told him to plead guilty and he would get the charges reduced at \nsentencing. Applicant stated he did not want to plead guilty. However, he stated once \nhe pled guilty his attorney did not attempt to \u201cplea bargain\u201d or get the sentence reduced. \nHe further stated: \u201cI [pled] guilty because my attorney told me to do so and would get \nthe charges reduced.\u201d At his hearing Applicant admitted he asked his daughter to \nexpose her breasts between five to eight times from June 2004 to August 2004. He \ndenies he masturbated. He denies he ever touched his daughter, despite his guilty \npleas. He stated he understands what he asked his daughter to do was wrong and \ntakes responsibility for his actions.6 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with malicious wounding, a class 3 felony, in \ndomestic court. Applicant and his wife were involved in an altercation on January 2, \n2007. They were separated at the time. Applicant admitted he and his wife had a \nconversation by phone shortly before he went over to her residence. He went to her \nhome and they spoke to each other in the doorway. He admitted he had his foot in the \ndoor entryway. She attempted to remove him from the door jam area and push him \nback. He stated he walked away and she ran after him with an object, so he raised his \nsteel toe work boot and kicked her from behind. He stated he was trying to leave the \npremises and his foot struck her knee. The police report notes \u201cbruises and cuts.\u201d7 He \nadmitted he did not use good judgment going to her home. The charge is listed as \n\u201cunder advisement\u201d which is equivalent to a deferred adjudication. The charge was \ndismissed on March 19, 2009.8 \n \n \nApplicant was aware that a condition of his probation was not to get in any \ntrouble. His wife had filed for divorce while he was in jail. His daughter who was over 18, \nno longer lived with his wife, but his two sons did. Applicant stated that after he was \nincarcerated his daughter was placed in foster care because she had made allegations \nagainst her mother.9  \n \n \nA protective order was issued against Applicant after the altercation directing him \nto stay away from his wife and sons. Prior to then he had supervised probation with his \n \n5 Tr. 49-52; GE 4. \n \n6 Tr. 27, 44-48, 97. \n \n7 GE 5. \n \n8 Tr. 28-29, 58-74, 92-99; GE 8. \n \n9 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nsons. The protective order prohibited him from having any type of contact or \ncommunication at all with his sons from January 2007 to January 2008.10  \n \n \nOn March 17, 2007, Applicant was charged with violating the protective order. \nThe court determined that Applicant was attempting to indirectly contact his sons. \nApplicant explained that while at the bowling alley he said to a woman, whom he knew \nhad contact with his sons, \u201cI just wish I could tell my boys I love them.\u201d The woman then \ntold the boys and they told their mother. Applicant did not think he did anything wrong \nby making this statement. He stated he did not ask her to do anything. He explained \nthat this incident shows that he loves his kids and it was very difficult because he was \nnot permitted to see his boys. He further stated \u201cIt is hard because I destroyed their \nlives with what I did.\u201d11  \n \n \nApplicant was charged with violating the protective order. On August 27, 2007, \nthe court found \u201cfacts sufficient to find guilt but defer adjudication.\u201d Applicant appealed \nthe case. The guilty finding was then taken \u201cunder advisement,\u201d requiring Applicant to \nremain out of trouble and the charge would be dismissed. The charge was dismissed on \nSeptember 29, 2008.12 \n \nApplicant submitted his application for employment on July 7, 2006, Applicant \nindicated he was convicted of \u201ctwo class 6 felonies on 18 April 2005, sentenced to 1 \nyear in [city] jail, and probation for 9 years.\u201d13 Applicant stated that he told his Foreman \nand General Foreman in January 2007 and March 2007, about his convictions. He did \nnot tell his facility security officer. He stated he assumed that because he told his \nForeman and listed the felonies on his job application that he would be asked about the \noffenses. He was not advised nor was he aware that he needed to tell his facility \nsecurity officer about his record. When he turned in his job application he was asked \nwhat the nature of the felonies were and he stated he divulged they were sex crimes, \nbut did not divulge the crimes involved a minor.14  \n \nApplicant stated that due to the stressful deployments he was on while serving in \nthe Navy he used pornography to help him relax following his retirement. He then \nbecame addicted to viewing pornography. He saw a counselor for approximately six \nmonths, but said the counselor kept falling asleep during his sessions. He did not get \nanother counselor. He stated he chose to act out on his daughter rather than other \noutlets. He stated he hated himself for it. While in jail he participated in group sessions \nfor sex offenders once a week for a year. After his release he participated in weekly \ngroup counseling for sexual addiction and at the same time attended individual \n \n10 Id. \n \n11 Tr. 29-30, 76-85. \n \n12 AE B.  \n \n13 AE A. \n \n14 Tr. 30-33, 52-58, 84-91, 100-104. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \ncounseling on a weekly basis. He did this for a year. Approximately six months ago his \ncounseling was reduced to twice a month and recently it was reduced further to once a \nmonth. He does not have the internet in his house.15  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sons are aware of the offenses. Applicant visits them once every six \nweeks because they live in another state. He must get permission and a travel pass to \ntravel outside of the state and must contact his probation officer upon his return. All \nvisits are supervised as part of the terms of his probation. He speaks with the boys and \nhis ex-wife three to four times a week. Some people at work know of the offenses and \nsome do not. Applicant is engaged and his fianc\u00e9e is aware of his offenses. She is a \nfoster parent to a 17-year-old girl. The foster child is also aware of his past. Applicant \ncan not spend the night at his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s house and can not have any unsupervised \ncontact with a girl under the age of 18. Applicant has no contact with his daughter and \ndoes not know where she lives. He learned from his ex-wife that she is now married and \nhas a child. He can not have any contact with her while he is on probation.16 \n \nApplicant stated that his problems were due to post-traumatic stress due to \nstressful deployments he had while serving in the Navy. His counselor provided a letter \nand stated:  \n \n[Applicant] was trying to balance a bad marriage, a stressful military \ncareer, and was submerged in an under water vessel in enemy territory for \nextended periods of time.  \n \n                                                        * * * \n \n[Applicant] continues to be focused on his treatment, and committed to a \nhealthy life. \n \n* * * \n \nHe has learned from his past mistakes, loves his family, his country, and \nrefused to tarnish or disappoint either of those which he holds in the \nhighest esteem.17  \n \n \nApplicant stated he made a horrible mistake, but it has nothing to do with his job. \nHe stated he has never violated his probation, but admitted he had two incidents that \nwere \u201cunder advisement.\u201d He stated he is not unreliable, but made some bad choices. \nHe is complying with the terms of his probation. He stated he is not a horrible human \nbeing, but made gross mistakes. When asked what his explanation was for his actions \n \n15 Tr. 99, 106-111, 119. \n \n16 Tr.74-76,112-118. \n \n17 AE D. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nagainst his daughter he stated: \u201cMy counselor has told me that some of it is post-\ntraumatic stress.\u201d He does not know why he chose to act out against his daughter \ninstead of other ways.18   \n \n \nApplicant provided copies of awards he received while in the Navy that I \nconsidered.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n \n18 Tr. 118-121. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct AG \u00b6 31 \nand especially considered: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of two charges of indecent liberties with his minor \ndaughter, both felonies. He also was charged with violating a protective order and \nmalicious wounding. The court found there was sufficient evidence for a finding of guilt \nand deferred adjudication. The charges were eventually dismissed. Applicant served \neleven months in jail and is on supervised probation until at least 2015. He is required to \nregister as a sex offender. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 23 and especially considered the following: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant pled guilty to indecent liberties, including touching his daughter. I did \nnot find his statements credible that he did not commit the aggravated offense of \ntouching his daughter. Applicant is on supervised probation for another six years. He \nhas been in counseling and appears to be getting his life in order. However, subsequent \nto his release from jail he had two incidents resulting in charges of malicious wounding \nand violating a protective order. Both charges were held \u201cunder advisement\u201d and were \nnot dismissed until September 2008 and March 2009. These charges occurred while \nApplicant was on probation and a determination was made that there was sufficient \nevidence for a finding of guilt. I have considered the seriousness of the offenses; \nApplicant\u2019s actions subsequent to his release from jail; and the fact he continues on \nsupervised probation. I find all of these matters cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. Although there is some evidence that he is \nremorseful for his actions, there is still a level of inconsistency in his attitude regarding \nhis offenses. He pled guilty to indecently touching his daughter, but denies he did it and \nthat he was only doing what his lawyer told him to do. He does admit he asked her to lift \nher shirt up on numerous occasions. He retired from the Navy in 2000 and admitted he \nwas addicted to pornography as a stress reliever and he suffers from post-traumatic \nstress disorder. I find under the circumstances although there is evidence of some \nrehabilitation, it is not enough to overcome the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nlack of good judgment regarding the sexual offenses and his subsequent criminal \ncharges. I find none of the above mitigating conditions apply.  \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nI have considered all of the facts and find Applicant provided sufficient notification \nto his employer that he was a convicted felony. He expressly stated on his employment \napplication the felony convictions, that he served time in jail, and was on probation for \nnine years. No evidence was provided that showed Applicant was required to provide \nthis information specifically to the facility security officer. Therefore, I find he did not \ndeliberately fail to divulge this information. His employer was sufficiently on notice \nregarding his felonies. \nI have considered all of the evidence presented regarding the allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c and conclude Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, that is his sexual \noffenses and his conduct after his release from jail create a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. There are some people that are aware of Applicant\u2019s criminal \nconduct, others are not. I have considered the nature of the conduct and if known, \nconclude it is likely to affect his personal, professional and community standing. \nTherefore, I find disqualifying condition (e) applies.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 17 and especially considered the following: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy , unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \nApplicant\u2019s offenses are not minor and he remains on probation for felony \noffenses for another six years. Applicant must continue to register as a sex offender. \nThe concerns under this guideline and the analysis are the same as was addressed \nunder the criminal conduct guideline.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served twenty years in the \nNavy and deployed on important missions. He pled guilty to indecent liberties with his \ndaughter and was convicted of two felonies. He served eleven months in jail and was \nplaced on supervised probation for nine years. There are six years remaining in his \nprobation. Applicant admitted he made a horrible mistake. He also stated he did not \ncommit the offense he pled guilty to, but only did so because his lawyer told him to. He \nhas supervised probation with his sons. He was charged with two offenses related to his \nfamily after he was released from jail. His counselor believes he has learned from his \nmistakes and is committed to a healthy lifestyle. I have concerns about Applicant\u2019s \njudgment. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from criminal conduct \nand personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline E: \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph   2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Finding error, we reverse.\n1\nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was born in the U.S. to\nLebanese parents, thereby acquiring Lebanese citizenship.  Shortly after her birth, her family moved\nto Lebanon, where Applicant grew up.  She returned to the U.S. in the mid-2000s to attend college\nand has lived in this country ever since.  \nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Lebanon.  He is a retired general in the\nLebanese military, living on a pension.  He attends luncheons with other retired generals and has an\nacquaintance who is highly placed in the Lebanese government.

When he is not visiting in this country,\nApplicant speaks with him approximately once every other week by telephone.  Applicant has a\nsister who is a citizen of Lebanon residing in the U.S.  Her brother is a dual citizen of Lebanon and\nthe U.S., who also resides in the U.S.  \nLebanese policy is heavily influenced by Syria, which is a state sponsor of terrorism.\nLebanese instability enables foreign terrorist organizations to operate within its borders.  The most\nprominent such organization is Hezbollah, which the U.S. has designated as a \u201cForeign Terrorist\nOrganization.\u201d  The Lebanese government recognizes Hezbollah as a legitimate political party.  It\nmaintains offices in Beirut and elsewhere in Lebanon and is closely allied with Iran.  Hezbollah\nattempts to obtain U.S. technology.   \nDiscussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\n\nDirective \u00b6 8(a): \u201cthe nature of the relationships with the foreign persons, the country in which these persons\n2\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment and the interests of the U.S[.]\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 8(c): \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\n3\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation[.]\u201d\n3\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel argues on appeal that the Judge erred in her application of two Foreign\nInfluence Mitigating Conditions (FIMC), 8(a)  and 8(c).   The essence of Department Counsel\u2019s\n2\n3\nargument is that Applicant\u2019s relationship with her father raises security concerns which Applicant\u2019s\nevidence failed to mitigate.  This argument is persuasive.  \nThe Board notes the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant\u2019s father is a retired general; that he is\na citizen and resident of Lebanon; that he associates frequently with other retired officers, including\na high-ranking official in the Lebanese government; that Applicant speaks with her father by\ntelephone on a bi-weekly basis; that Lebanese policy is heavily influenced by Syria, which is a state\nsponsor of terrorism; that Hezbollah, a terrorist organization, operates within Lebanon with\nconsiderable freedom; and that Hezbollah holds seats in the Lebanese National Assembly.  We also\nnote record evidence that Hezbollah is closely allied with Iran, taking its ideological inspiration from\nthe Iranian revolution.  U.S. State Department Country Reports on Terrorism, April 30, 2009, at 3.\nWithout suggesting that Applicant\u2019s father has engaged in improper activity, it is nevertheless\n\n4\nforeseeable that his presence in Lebanon could be a means through which Applicant could be\ncoerced into compromising classified activity.  Applicant\u2019s evidence does not demonstrate that her\nties to the U.S. so outweigh her ties to her father that she would not likely be placed in a position of\nchoosing U.S. interests over his.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007) (\u201cThe\npresence of immediate family members in a country which a hostile foreign power like Syria is\nattempting to destabilize, and in which terrorist groups operate with a substantial degree of\nautonomy, poses a real concern in the adjudication of [an applicant\u2019s] request for a security\nclearance\u201d).  \nBy the same token, the evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s\ncommunications with her father are casual and infrequent.  Indeed, there is a rebuttable presumption\nthat communications with close family members are not causal by nature.  See ISCR Case No. 07-\n13696 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009).  The Judge\u2019s findings and the record evidence concerning\nApplicant\u2019s communications with her father are not sufficient to rebut that presumption.  In light of\nthe above, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable on this record, viewed\nin light of the Egan standard.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

The Applicant is 25 years of age and has a Master\u2019s Degree in Engineering Management, and a Master\u2019s Degree in Logistics and Supply Chain Management. She is employed as a Systems Engineer for a defense contractor. She seeks a security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense industry. Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. The Applicant was born in the United States in 1984, and is a United States citizen. Her father, who is of Lebanese decent, is a Lebanese citizen by virtue of his birth, and thus, the Applicant is also a Lebanese citizen. The Applicant considers herself only an American. (Tr. p. 57). Shortly after her birth, her family moved to Lebanon where she grew up a Christian speaking English, Arabic, and a little French at home. In 2005, she moved back to the United States to attend college, where she obtained two Master\u2019s degrees and excelled academically. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E and F).

On November 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guidelines C and B for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on February 23, 2009, and she requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was originally assigned to\nanother Administrative Judge on May 15, 2009.  It was transferred to the undersigned\non June 9, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 16, 2009, scheduling the\nhearing for July 14, 2009.  At the hearing the Government presented two exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2.  The Applicant presented eighteen exhibits,\n\n2\nreferred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through R, and testified on his own behalf.  The\nrecord remained open until close of business on July 21, 2009, to allow the Applicant\nthe opportunity to substitute signed documents  in lieu of the unsigned documents that\nwere admitted into evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C and D.  The Applicant\nsubmitted said documents.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on July 23, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political condition in Lebanon.  The Applicant and\nher counsel had no objection.  (Tr. p. 14).  The request and the attached documents\nwere not admitted into evidence but were included in the record. The facts\nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 25 years of age and has a Master\u2019s Degree\nin Engineering Management, and a Master\u2019s Degree in Logistics and Supply Chain\nManagement.  She is employed as a Systems Engineer for a defense contractor.  She\nseeks a security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in the United States in 1984, and is a United States\ncitizen.  Her father, who is of Lebanese decent, is a Lebanese citizen by virtue of his\nbirth, and thus, the Applicant is also a Lebanese citizen.  The Applicant considers\nherself only an American.  (Tr. p. 57).  Shortly after her birth, her family moved to\nLebanon where she grew up a Christian speaking English, Arabic, and a little French at\nhome.  In 2005, she moved back to the United States to attend college, where she\nobtained two Master\u2019s degrees and excelled academically.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E and\nF).  Since then, she has made the United States her permanent home.  In 2006, she\nbegan working for the defense industry. \nHer father, a 62 year old citizen of Lebanon, after thirty years, retired in 1997, as\na General in the Lebanese Army.  He currently receives a military pension of $2,000\nmonthly from the Lebanese government and owns two small houses in Lebanon.\nApplicant stated that if he died, she would not take any inheritance from her father. She\ndoes not want it to become a security concern.  (Tr. p. 87-88).  On a monthly to annual\nbasis, her father has lunch with other retired generals.  One of them is an important\n\n3\nperson in Lebanon.  (Tr. p. 92).  Her father has no other contact with any other military\nor government officials of Lebanon.  \nApplicant\u2019s father has had a United States green card for about ten years and is\ntrying to become a United States citizen.  (Tr. p. 63).  He is currently visiting the\nApplicant in the United States, and staying with her.  When he is not visiting in the\nUnited States, the Applicant telephones her father about once every other week or so.\n(Tr. p. 67).  Applicant\u2019s father is aware of the fact that the Applicant is undergoing a\nsecurity clearance investigation.  (Tr. p. 112).  Applicant states that she understands her\nresponsibilities to the DoD, while holding a security clearance, and her relationship with\nher father will never jeopardize it.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s 34 year old brother was born in Lebanon, and is a dual citizen of\nLebanon and the United States.  In 2009, he became a naturalized United States citizen\nand moved to the United States.  He resides in the United States with the Applicant\u2019s\nmother.  The Applicant communicates with him about once a month or so.  (Tr. p. 68).  \nThe Applicant\u2019s 31 year old sister is also a citizen of Lebanon.  She has had a\nUnited States green card for about ten years and is trying to become a United States\ncitizen.  (Tr. p. 70).  Her sister resides in the United States and is currently unemployed.\nApplicant sees her about twice a week. \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother and her maternal grandmother are United States citizens\nand reside in the United States.  Since 2002, Applicant\u2019s mother has been living in the\nUnited States and works as a teacher.    \nApplicant testified that she has family on her father\u2019s side, including uncles,\naunts, grandmother, cousins, nephews and nieces, in Lebanon.  Her only\ncommunication with them is when she visits there.  Only the Applicant\u2019s parents know\nthat she has applied for a security clearance, but they do not know any of the details.  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has acted in such a\nway as to show a preference for another country over the United States.\nThe Applicant had an identification card, issued by Lebanon in February 2000,\nwhen she was sixteen years old.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit O).  She has never held a\nLebanese passport and does not want one.  She testified that since moving to the\nUnited States, she has traveled to Lebanon every year for Christmas.  (Tr. p. 104).\nDuring these trips, she used her United States passport (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit N), and her\nLebanese identification card.  \nWhen the Applicant learned that her Lebanese identification card was raising\nsome security concerns, on July 13, 2009, she destroyed it in front of the company\u2019s in-\nhouse counsel.  A declaration from counsel confirms this.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit R).  The\nApplicant has no intentions of renewing it.  (Tr. p. 73).  Applicant also has a Lebanese\n\n4\ndrivers license that she got when she was eighteen that she does not use.  (Tr. p. 118).\nShe is willing to renounce her Lebanese citizenship.  (Tr. p. 81).\n  \nThe Applicant testified that she has always complied with security policy and\nprocedure of her company, and has gone above and beyond its requirements.  She\nstated that before any of her travel to Lebanon in the past, she consulted with her\ncompany security department.  She told them specifically where she was going, who\nshe would be in contact with, as well as her intent and duration of the trip.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit L).  Since it has raised a security concern, she will no longer travel to Lebanon.\n(Tr. p. 86). \n   \nThe Applicant has not yet voted in an American election, primarily because she\nhas been in school.  She plans to vote in the future.  She voted once in a Lebanese\nelection in 2002 or 2003 during a visit to Lebanon.  Other than that, she has never\nexercised any rights, privileges, or obligation or duties associated with her Lebanese\ncitizenship.  She has no financial holdings of any sort in Lebanon.  None of her college\neducation was paid for by the Lebanese government.  She has a checking account and\na 401(k) retirement account in the United States.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits P and Q).\nThe Applicant stated that if there were a conflict between the United States and\nLebanon, she would, without question, place her loyalty with the United States.  If\nsomeone contacted her and threatened to harm her family if she did not provide details\nof her job or sensitive information about the United States, she will not cooperate under\nany circumstances.  (Tr. p. 93 - 94).  She would immediately report this activity to her\nsecurity department.  She has no intentions of ever returning to Lebanon. \n      \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for 2006, 2007, and 2008 reflect either that\nshe \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d or \u201cfar exceeds expectations\u201d in every category.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, and C).\nLetters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s direct manager, and various\nprofessional associates and coworkers, attest to the Applicant\u2019s hard working nature\nand reliability. She is considered to be an excellent employee.  She is driven, dedicated\nand committed to her work.  She is said to be very conscientious and cognizant of\nsecurity related procedures and policies, and always complies with rules and\nregulations.  She is intelligent and demonstrates great leadership qualities.  She has\ntechnical, management and communication skills.  She is open, honest and trustworthy.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits G, H, I, and J).  Applicant has received various certificates and\nawards for her service with her employer.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit M).\nThe Applicant has contacts with Lebanon.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to\ndiscuss the relationship between Lebanon and the United States at this time.  I take\nadministrative notice of the following adjudicative facts about Lebanon.  Lebanon is a\nparliamentary republic that became independent in November 1943.  The U.S. policy is\nto maintain its traditional close ties with Lebanon and to help preserve its independence,\nsovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity.  Since its independence, Lebanon\u2019s\nnational policy has been determined by a small group of regional and sectarian leaders.\n\n5\nPolitical institutions often play a secondary role to religion and personality-based\npolitics.  Lebanon has been in a state of war with Israel since 1973.  Civil war broke out\nin April 1975, and did not end until 1991.  Since 1992, Lebanon has experienced social\nand political instability, economic uncertainty, lack of infrastructure, violent clashes with\nIsraeli forces and political assassinations. \nI also take administrative notice that Lebanon\u2019s foreign policy and internal\npolicies are heavily influenced by Syria, which maintains intelligence agents in Lebanon\nand is a state sponsor of terrorism.  The unstable political situation in Lebanon enables\nforeign terrorist organizations to operate within its borders.  Hezbollah is the most\nprominent terrorist group in Lebanon, and it has been designed by the U.S. Department\nof State as a \u201cForeign Terrorist Organization.\u201d  The Lebanese government recognizes\nHezbollah as a legitimate resistance group and political party.  Hezbollah maintains\noffices in Beirut and elsewhere in Lebanon, is closely allied with Iran, supports a variety\nof violent anti-Western groups, and has been involved in numerous anti-U.S. terrorist\nattacks.  Hezbollah seeks to obtain U.S. technology, has been involved in several\nefforts to obtain restricted, dual-use technology, and is considered by the U.S. to be the\nmost technically capable terrorist groups in the world.  A center for Hezbollah and\nSyrian activity is in the Bekaa Valley.\nFinally, I take administrative notice that Lebanon has a poor human rights record\nand has been ineffective in controlling terrorism and political violence.  Lebanese\nsecurity forces have engaged in arbitrary arrest, murder, torture, and other abuses.\nThere is an atmosphere of governmental corruption and lack of transparency.  Militias\nand non-Lebanese forces operating outside the area of Lebanese central government\nauthority have used informers and monitored telephones to obtain information about\ntheir perceived adversaries.  Ongoing political violence and terrorism directed at\nAmericans and U.S. interests make Lebanon dangerous for U.S. citizens.  \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\n\n6\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nForeign Preference\n9.  The Concern.  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for\na foreign country over the United States, then he or he may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n10.  (a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n11.  (a) dual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry;\n\n7\n11.  (b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh.  The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress, and \n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\n\n8\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference),\nand Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown\nbetween Applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to effectively safeguard classified\ninformation, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or\ndirect evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign\nconnections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to\nthe interests of the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign identification card\nraises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place\nthe interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The Government\nmust be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to\nabide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7.(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  Mitigating\nConditions 8.(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich theses persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government\nand the interests of the U.S. and 8.(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation applies.\nIt is noted that the current political situation in Lebanon elevates the cause for\nconcern in this case.  The evidence shows that the Applicant, a native born United\nStates citizen, has various family members, including a father, who is a citizen and\nresident of Lebanon.  Although she maintains contact with her father in Lebanon, the\nnature of the contact does not pose a security risk.  Admittedly, her father, who is a\nretired General in the Lebanese Army, has periodic lunches with other retired generals,\none of is an important person in Lebanon.  However, these visits are casual and social\n\n9\nand nothing more.  On her own volition, the Applicant offered evidence of her father\u2019s\nluncheon associate, who was at one time a retired general.  The Government did not\nhave this evidence, nor did the Applicant seek to hide it when she knew it could be\njeopardizing her chances of obtaining a security clearance.  \nThe Applicant has been honest, credible, and forthright, and fully understands\nher responsibilities to the United States while holding a security clearance.  She does\nnot discuss her work with her family or anyone else in Lebanon, and most do not know\nthat she works for a defense contractor.  She is conscientious and meticulous about\nhow she reports her foreign contacts and understands the importance of doing so.  In\naddition, her father is trying to become a United States citizen and desires to move to\nthe United States.  Under the particular facts of this case, the possibility of foreign\ninfluence does not exist, nor could it create the potential for conduct resulting in the\ncompromise of classified information.  I find that the Applicant is not vulnerable to\nforeign influence.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence).\nUnder Foreign Preference, Disqualifying Condition 10(a) exercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member applies.  However, Mitigation Conditions 11(a)\ndual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign country, and\n11(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship apply.\nAlthough the Applicant is by birth, a dual citizen of Lebanon and the United\nStates, she considers herself to be only an American.  She destroyed her Lebanese\nidentification card and is willing to formally renounced her Lebanese citizenship.  Except\nfor her father, who is waiting to become a naturalized United States citizen, she has\nessentially cut all ties to the country of Lebanon.  Under the circumstances of this case,\nI find for the Applicant under Guideline C (Foreign Preference). \nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of\nGuidelines B and C of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the\nDirective.  Accordingly, she has met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines\nB and C.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.b.: For the Applicant\n\n10\nSubpara.\n1.c.: For the Applicant\n \nSubpara.\n1.d.: For the Applicant\n \nSubpara.\n1.e.: For the Applicant\nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n2.a.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n2.b.: For the Applicant\n \n \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

On October 14, \n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 21, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on November 24, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 1, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on December 16, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, \nwhich were received without objection (Tr. 34). Applicant testified on his own behalf, \npresented one witness, and submitted exhibits (AE) 1 through 6, which were received \nwithout objection (Tr. 40). I kept the record open to allow Applicant time to submit \nadditional matters in support of his case. He submitted AE 7 post-hearing. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 24, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1, \nexcept for SOR \u00b6 1.j, which he denied. He also denied all the allegations under SOR \u00b6 \n2. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, including his demeanor and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old principal engineer scientist (Tr. 122). He completed his \nBachelors of Science degree in electrical engineering in June 1976 (Tr. 6). He has \nworked for government contractors for the last 32 years. Except for a five month period \nof unemployment, from May to September 2001, he has been consistently employed \nsince November 1995 to the day of his hearing (Tr. 80-83).2 He was underemployed \nfrom September 2001 until around 2002-2003. \n \nIn August 2008, he was hired by his current employer, a government contractor. \nHis supervisor over the past four months considers Applicant to be dedicated, honest, \nand a good employee (Tr. 144). He has known Applicant since August 2008, when he \nhired him from another government contractor to come and work for his company. In his \nopinion, Applicant is reliable and always gives his best effort. He believes Applicant \nmade an honest mistake when he submitted his security clearance application and \nrecommended his continued access to classified information. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant presented character statements from friends, co-\nworkers (some of them retired service members), and a facility security officer (FSO), \nmost of whom have know him for around five years (AE 6 and GE 4). Applicant is \nconsidered to be honest, trustworthy, and a model employee. At his prior job, he was \nthe point of contact for dealing with classified documents and computer systems. He \nhas a reputation for knowing and diligently following security rules and regulations. In \nhis references\u2019 opinions, he has been a strong team member, an important asset to his \nemployer, and a dedicated husband and father. There is no reason to doubt his \npatriotism, honor, and love for the United States. He is not considered a security risk. All \nhis references endorsed his continued access to classified information. His FSO \nbelieves Applicant was provided wrong advice, and that with proper instruction \n \n2  Applicant also had a two-month period of unemployment during 1995. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant would not have made the mistakes that led to his pending security clearance \ndetermination. \n \nIn 1977-1978, Applicant received access to classified information at the secret \nlevel from the Department of the Navy (Tr. 7). Thereafter, he had access to classified \ninformation on-and-off based on his employment needs. Applicant has had continued \naccess to classified information at the secret level from 1998 to his hearing (Tr. 134). \nThere is no evidence, and the government did not allege, that Applicant has ever \ncompromised or caused others to compromise classified information. Since 1998, \nApplicant has submitted several security clearance applications. However, all but his \nlast application were paper applications. His October 2006 application was an e-QIP \ncompleted using his work computer. He claimed he was unfamiliar with the electronic \nsecurity clearance application, and was confused filing the application. \n \nApplicant married his first wife in 1980 and they were divorced in 1987 (Tr. 116-\n118). He adopted his wife\u2019s two children from a prior marriage. The two children are \nnow adults and live independently. He married his second wife in 1988 and they were \ndivorced in 1997. He married his third wife in 1997 and they were divorced in 1999. He \nmarried his fourth wife in November 1999 and they were divorced in August 2001. He \nmarried his current wife in October 2001. He has no other children. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his October 2006 security clearance application, his responses to \nDOHA interrogatories (GE 3 & 4); and two credit bureau reports (CBRs) (GEs 2 & 4).  \n \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent/charged off accounts. Applicant admitted that \nseven of the 11 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR were his legal obligations. He \nchallenged three of the SOR allegations because they are duplicates of already alleged \ndebts. I find that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.i allege the same debt (Tr. 127); 1.b and 1.g allege \nthe same debt (Tr. 124-125); and 1.d and 1.k allege the same debt. He also claimed \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.i, 1.b and 1.g are the same debt. However, he failed to present \ndocumentary evidence to establish these four debts are the same. Applicant paid all \ndelinquent debts after receipt of his October 2008 SOR, except for SOR \u00b6 1.a (same as \n1.i) which remains outstanding. Applicant\u2019s insurer paid SOR \u00b6 1.j before his receipt of \nthe SOR.  \n \nApplicant admitted his debts have been delinquent since 2001. He stopped \npaying his debts when he lost his job and was unemployed for a period of five months in \n2001. Applicant explained that his financial problems were caused by a combination of \nfactors; i.e., two periods or unemployment (the first for two months in 1995, and the \nsecond from May to September 2001), a period of underemployment after September \n2001, and his four divorces (Tr. 27, 43). He testified that prior to 1996, he had excellent \ncredit. He acquired most of his delinquent debts between 1998 and 2001 (Tr. 44, 130).  \n \nApplicant claimed he made no effort to settle, pay, or resolve the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($10,212) (a water purification system for the foreclosed mobile home (Tr. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n87-88)); 1.e ($10,360) (note for a repossessed car he gave to his ex-wife (Tr. 89)); 1.f \n($25,253) (mortgage for repossessed mobile home Applicant purchased for ex-wife (Tr. \n95-96)); and 1.h ($3,559) (computer he purchased for ex-wife (Tr. 102-103)), because \nthese items were awarded to his ex-wife by his 1999 divorce decree (Tr. 104). \nApplicant\u2019s 1999 divorce decree awarded the mobile home to his ex-wife (AE 7). \nHowever, the divorce decree is silent with respect to the debt for the computer and the \ncar. Applicant testified he purchased the computer and the car, and that his ex-wife kept \nboth items as part of the division of assets during the divorce. He claimed she agreed to \npay for both items. Applicant presented no documentary evidence to establish his \nclaims.3 \n \nIn 2003-2004, Applicant and his current wife were in the process of buying a \nhome. His delinquent debts surfaced during his home loan application process. \nApplicant claimed that a banker (a friend of his wife) advised him to forget about the old \ndelinquent debts \u2013 to let them go, because they would eventually drop off his credit \nreport (Tr. 66-67, 135, GE 4). Applicant and his wife bought the home in August-\nSeptember 2004. \n \nDuring his December 2006 background interview with a government investigator, \nApplicant was confronted with the same delinquent obligations alleged in the SOR. He \nadmitted that the acquired the debts, but claimed that his ex-wife took responsibility for \nmost of them, some pursuant to his 1999 divorce decree. Applicant stated he had no \nintention to pay the debts (GE 3).  \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (GE 1). In \nresponse to question 27 (asking whether in the last seven years he had his wages \ngarnished or had any property repossessed for any reason), Applicant deliberately \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose that he had his car repossessed (SOR \u00b6 1.e), that \nthe mobile home he purchased was repossessed (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and that his mortgage \nwas foreclosed for lack of payments (GE 3).  \n \nIn his answers to question 28 (asking whether during the last seven years he had \nbeen over 180 days delinquent on any debts, and whether he was currently over 90 \ndays delinquent on any debts), Applicant answer \u2018No,\u201d and deliberately failed to disclose \nthe delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.f, 1. h, and 1.i. \n \nApplicant repeatedly averred he never intended to deceive the government or to \nfalsify his security clearance application \u2013 that he made an honest mistake (Tr. 43-45). \nHe claimed he omitted the required information because of the following reasons (Tr. \n27-29, 43): (1) it was the first time he completed an e-QIP and he was confused; (2) he \nmisread or did not read completely question 27 (Tr. 59-60); (3) an assistant facility \nsecurity officer told him to go back only five years (instead of the seven years required \nby the e-QIP); (4) he believed the delinquent debts had dropped off his CBR (a banker \ntold him that the debts would fall off); (5) when he submitted his e-QIP he was in a \n \n3  Moreover, there is no evidence the creditors agreed to release him from these obligations and \ngenerally, a family court decision does not release him from responsibility for debts. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nstable marital situation, he was current in all his present debts, and forgot about his past \ndelinquent debts; (6) he knew that the debts and foreclosures would be discovered and \naddressed when the investigators reviewed his CBRs (Tr. 62); (7) he did not disclose \nthe repossessions and foreclosures because those debts were assigned to his wife by \nthe 1999 divorce decree; and (8) he believe the sale of the foreclosed property covered \nthe debt owed (Tr. 98-103, 111). \n \nApplicant testified that since September-October 2001, he and his current wife \nhave been reestablishing his credit. They have lived within their means, and they do not \nabuse their credit or use credit cards. Since 2001, they have paid all their new debts. He \nhas been able to pay his new creditors because of a stable marriage and good working \nopportunities.  \n \nAs soon as he realized the adverse impact his bad credit would have on his \nability to possess a security clearance (i.e., he received the SOR), Applicant cashed in \nhis 401(k) to pay his delinquent debts (AE 1). He paid all six delinquent debts after \nreceipt of his October 2008 SOR (except for 1.a). He explained he never attempted to \nresolve his debts before October 2008, because he did not have the financial means to \ndo so. His earnings were not sufficient to pay for his delinquent obligations and his \nfamily\u2019s day-to-day living expenses (Tr. 72-73). He also explained he made an honest \nmistake when he followed the wrong advice from his banker friend to let the debts lapse \nand fall off of his CBR. \n \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse and embarrassment for the way he \nhandled his past financial problems. He promised never to get in the same situation \nagain. He explained his financial problems were caused by a unique set of \ncircumstances and misunderstandings that were unlikely to repeat themselves. He has \nlearned his lesson and he is now well aware of what it is required of him to show that he \nis reliable, trustworthy, and financially responsible. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.4 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n \n4  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d5 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an Applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n \n \n5  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleged seven delinquent/charged off accounts (not considering \nduplications) totaling approximately $55,000. Of these, only SOR \u00b6 1.a (same as 1.i) \n($1,279), remains outstanding, because Applicant claims it is a duplicate of a paid debt. \nHe failed to present documentary evidence to support his claim. Applicant acquired all \nof his delinquent debts from 1998 to 2001. He stopped paying his debts in 2001, when \nhe was unemployed/underemployed. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($10,212) and 1.f \n($25,253) were awarded to his ex-wife pursuant to his 1999 divorce decree.6 \n \nHe presented no evidence (other than his testimony) of any efforts to settle, pay \nor resolve his legal obligations from 2001 to December 2008. He claimed he did not \nhave the financial means to pay his legal obligations, delinquent debts, and his day-to-\nday living expenses. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and, AG \u00b6 \n19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \n6  See supra foot note 3. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant receives credit for paying all his delinquent debts (but one), albeit after \nreceipt of the SOR. Notwithstanding, I find that AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. His financial \nproblems are recent and not isolated. He carried a large delinquent debt for seven \nyears, waiting for the statute of limitations to lapse and his debts to fall of his CBR. The \nongoing nature of his delinquent debts and the number of debts show \u201ca continuing \ncourse of conduct.\u201d  \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence that established circumstances beyond his control \ncontributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his numerous divorces; he was \nunemployed/underemployed during five months in 2001; and for a period of time he was \nunderemployed and did not have the financial means to pay his past debts and his \nfamily\u2019s day-to-day living expenses. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but only partially.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He carried a large delinquent debt for seven years, waiting for the \nstatute of limitations to lapse and his debts to fall of his CBR. He deliberately failed to \ntake any action to resolve his delinquent debt. He was continuously and gainfully \nemployed since September 2001 to the present. He changed employers several times, \non each occasion improving his economic situation. He purchased cars, bought a home, \nand contributed to his 401(k). However, Applicant failed to take any action to resolve his \ndebts until after he received the SOR.  \n \n \nHe claimed he did nothing to resolve his delinquencies because of the bad \nadvice he received. In 2003-2004 when he allegedly received the bad advice, Applicant \nwas 47 years old, a college graduate, a successful employee of government contractor \nfor many years, and had had access to classified information (on-and-off) for 25 years. \nApplicant knew or should have known that the government requires individuals \nentrusted with access to classified information to be responsible, trustworthy, and to \ndisplay good judgment.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies. He paid his delinquent debts (except one). He has stable \nemployment with sufficient income, and he no longer has any financial problems. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations concerns. Considering the totality of the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s last \nminute actions to repay his creditors do not raise to the level of good-faith efforts to \nresolve his debts. His failure to pay his debts for seven years shows lack of judgment \nand an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. His actions raise questions \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. AG \u00b6 15.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant omitted relevant information in his answers to questions 27 and 28 of \nhis security clearance application. I conclude Applicant\u2019s omission of the foreclosure \nand repossession of his mobile home (SOR \u00b6 1.f) was not deliberate. His 1999 divorce \ndecree awarded his ex-wife the mobile home. It was reasonable for Applicant to believe \nthat the mobile home was no longer his property, and that all financial responsibility for \nit rested with his ex-wife.7 The divorce decree is silent with respect to Applicant\u2019s \nrepossessed car, or any other loan, or item he purchased for his ex-wife. He presented \nno documentary evidence to show that the car, loans, or any items were his ex-wife\u2019s \nfinancial responsibility. \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, I find Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nthe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.e, and 1.h. He personally acquired these debts and \nstopped paying them when he lost his job and was unemployed for five months. He \nrediscovered his debts in 2003-2004 when he was in the process of buying his home, \nand elected not to pay his delinquent obligations. He chose to let the statute of \nlimitations run so that the debts would expire, and with time, fall off his CBR. He was \nconfronted with the delinquent debts in 2006 and he again stated his intent not to pay \nthem. In light of Applicant\u2019s education, maturity, his employment history, his demeanor \nand testimony, and the lack of credibility of his numerous explanations, I find he knew \nabout the debts and chose to ignore them. In 2006, when he completed his security \nclearance application, Applicant knew or should have known about his delinquent \nobligations and deliberately failed to disclose them. \n \nBecause of his extensive experience working for government contractors and \nholding a security clearance, Applicant knew the importance of accurately completing \nhis security clearance application and telling the truth. Nevertheless, he failed to provide \ninformation that was material to making an informed security decision and made a false \nstatement. AG \u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire,\u201d applies. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n \n7  Generally, a family court decision does not release a debtor from responsibility for debts unless \nthe creditors consent, or they are part of the legal action. \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \n \n \nAfter considering all the mitigating conditions, I find none applies to this case. \nApplicant made no effort to correct his omissions until he was confronted with his \ndelinquent debts. I do not believe his claims that security personnel told him to go back \nonly five years, or that a banker told him to disregard his delinquent obligations. \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s extensive list of conflicting explanations \nis not credible. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 17(c), and find it does not apply since his \nbehavior is recent and shows Applicant\u2019s lack of reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, educated, and \nwell trained man. He has diligently and successfully worked for numerous government \ncontractors for 32 years. He has held access to classified information on-and-off for \napproximately 30 years without any complaints or violations.  \n \nBecause of his years in the service and his many years holding access to \nclassified information, Applicant knew or should have known the importance of the trust \nplaced on him by the Government. Notwithstanding, he failed to be candid and honest \non his security clearance application and during his testimony at hearing. His behavior \nshows he lacks judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and personal \nconduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e, and 1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i -1.k: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a   \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.b   \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 57-year-old systems engineer, who has been employed by his defense contractor employer since June 2007.

Clearance is granted. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on June 18, 2007. On June 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines C (Foreign Influence), and B (Foreign Preference) for Applicant. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nFebruary 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on August 19, 2008. He answered the SOR in \nwriting on August 22, 2008, and elected to have his case decided on the written record \nin lieu of a hearing. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s Response to SOR on August 24, 2008. \nPursuant to the Additional Procedural Guidance of the Directive, Department Counsel \nrequested that the case be converted to a hearing. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on October 8, 2008, and I received the case assignment on October 21, \n2008.  \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 7, 2008, scheduling a hearing for \nDecember 4, 2008. The hearing was convened and completed as scheduled. The \nGovernment offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A, \nwithout objection. I held the record open until December 15, 2008 to afford the Applicant \nthe opportunity to submit additional matters. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on December 12, 2008. On January 6, 2009, Applicant submitted AE B \nand AE C, which were received without objection. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof the certain facts relating to Taiwan. The request, which contained a country \nsummary, and accompanying documents, were marked as GE 3 through 17 and \nreceived without objection. (Tr. 9, 12-14).  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to \nTaiwan were derived from GE 3 through 17 as indicated under subheading \u201cTaiwan\u201d of \nthis decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. \nHis admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old systems engineer, who has been employed by his \ndefense contractor employer since June 2007. He is a first-time applicant for a security \nclearance. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was born in Taiwan in December 1951, where he was raised and spent \nhis formative years. He attended college/graduate school in Taiwan and was awarded a \nBachelor of Science degree in chemistry in May 1974, and a Master\u2019s Degree in \nchemistry in June 1976. Tr. 60. He served two years of mandatory military service in the \nTaiwanese Army from 1976 to 1978 as a junior officer assigned to instructor duty \nteaching physics and mathematics. Tr. 23-25, 61-62. He pursued his graduate studies \nin the U.S., and was awarded a Ph.D. in chemistry instrumentation in March 1987, \ndiscussed infra. Tr. 60-61. \n \nApplicant married his wife in December 1979 in Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s wife, like \nhim, was born and spent her formative years in Taiwan. GE 1. In August 1982, \nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. on a student visa to attend graduate school for his \nPh.D., discussed supra. Tr. 56. Applicant\u2019s wife and oldest son joined him later in the \nU.S. Applicant\u2019s oldest son was born in Taiwan in October 1982. Applicant became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in January 1999. He was issued a U.S. passport in October \n2003. Applicant\u2019s wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 1988, and his oldest \nson became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March 1999. Applicant\u2019s second son was born \nin the U.S. in April 1989, and is a U.S. citizen by birth. GE 1. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is employed as a secretary. Together, Applicant and his wife \nmake a comfortable six figure income. Tr. 69-80. Applicant\u2019s oldest son is employed at a \nbank and currently lives with Applicant and his wife. Applicant\u2019s other son is a \nsophomore attending a prestigious university in the U.S. Tr. 53-54. \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Taiwan, and that he \nheld a valid Taiwanese passport after being issued his U.S. passport (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.-1.c.). \nIn November 2008, Applicant surrendered his Taiwanese passport to the Taiwanese \ngovernment. He also applied for \u201cexpatriation\u201d with the Taiwanese government \nrenouncing his Taiwanese citizenship. In December 2008, the Taiwanese government \nissued him a \u201cCertificate of Renunciation of Nationality\u201d thus approving his request. Tr. \n57-59, AE A \u2013 AE C. \n \nApplicant has four living siblings in Taiwan, two sisters, ages 63 and 60, and two \nbrothers, ages 52 and 50. His 63-year-old sister is a retired teacher, his 60-year-old \nsister is retired from a factory, his 52-year-old brother is a physician, and his 50-year-old \nbrother is a dentist. He has one sister who is deceased (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). Tr. 29-37, 65-66. \nApplicant speaks to his 63-year-old sister by telephone \u201cabout every three months\u201d and \nspeaks to his other siblings by telephone \u201cevery six months to one year.\u201d Tr. 66-67. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is 80 years old and lives in Taiwan (SOR \u00b6 2.b.). Tr. 68. None \nof his siblings or relatives are associated with or employed by the Taiwanese \ngovernment. Tr. 39. \n \nApplicant visited Taiwan three times since he immigrated to the U.S. in 1984. \nThe first visit was for eight days during December 2003/January 2004 for a family visit. \nThe second and third visits were in 2006. The second visit was in October following his \nfather\u2019s stroke and the third visit was a month later in November to attend his father\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nfuneral. The latter two visits lasted approximately one week each (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e.-1.f.). GE \n2, Tr. 63-65. Applicant used his Taiwanese passport when he traveled to Taiwan in \n2003 and 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.e.). As noted supra, Applicant surrendered his Taiwanese \npassport to the Taiwanese government in November 2008. \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owned an apartment in Taiwan valued at \napproximately $150,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. 1.f.). During the hearing, the \u201cofficial\u201d value of the \napartment was established at about $300,000, which is divided among the six remaining \nchildren and/or their heirs. Applicant\u2019s oldest sister pays taxes on that apartment. \nApplicant is unsure about his inheritance status in light of his having given up his \nTaiwanese passport and citizenship. Other than his uncertain interest in the apartment \nhis father left to his six children, Applicant does not have any real or personal property \nin Taiwan. Tr. 45-47. \n \nApplicant and his wife own their home valued at approximately $350,000 free \nand clear. He has a 401(k) account valued at $300,000 and approximately $30,000 \ncash in the bank, with a total net worth of $630,000. Tr. 62-63. \n \nTaiwan1 \n \nIn 1949, two million refugees fled from a civil war in mainland China to Taiwan. \nThat same year, Communists in mainland China established the Peoples\u2019 Republic of \nChina (PRC or China), and Chiang Kai-shek established a separate, provisional capital \nfor his government in Taipei, Taiwan. The PRC does not recognize Taiwan\u2019s \nindependence, and insists that there is only \u201cone China.\u201d After long recognizing Taiwan, \non January 1, 1979, the U.S. formally recognized the government of the PRC as the \nsole legal government of China. The U.S. does not support independence for Taiwan \nand is committed to a \u201cone-China policy,\u201d under the Taiwan Relations Act, signed into \nlaw on April 10, 1979.  \n \n \nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy that has significant economic contacts with \nChina, and it has developed a strong economy since its separation from the PRC in \n1949. However, Taiwan\u2019s own national security remains under constant threat from the \nPRC and this has led to Taiwan\u2019s large military establishment. The PRC\u2019s Ministry of \nState Security is the \u201cpreeminent civilian intelligence collection agency in China,\u201d and \nmaintains intelligence operations in Taiwan, through a bureau utilizing PRC nationals \nwith Taiwan connections.  \n \n \nTaiwan is known to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence, and the \nNational Counterintelligence Center (NACIC)\u2019s 2000 Annual Report to Congress on \nForeign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage lists Taiwan as being among the \nmost active collectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information. The 2000 Report \nhighlights specific incidents wherein Taiwan engaged in attempts to acquire export-\nrestricted products.  \n \n1 The contents of the Taiwan section are taken in whole or in part from GE 3 through 17. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \nThese collection activities are ongoing, as evidenced by the January 2006 \nconviction and four-year prison sentence of Jonathan C. Sanders on charges related to \nthe theft of sensitive and proprietary information by and for Taiwanese companies.   \nAdditionally, in December 2005, Donald Keyser, the Principal Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, pled guilty to illegally removing \nclassified materials and to providing false statements to the U.S. Government.  Mr. \nKeyser was engaged in a relationship with, and met with, an intelligence officer \nemployed by the National Intelligence Bureau, the foreign intelligence agency of the \ngovernment of Taiwan. \n \n \nPolicies \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security or trustworthiness suitability, an \nadministrative judge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d (AG(s)). The AGs include brief \nintroductory explanations for each AG, and provide specific disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions. \n \n \nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AGs \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n  \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive] information \nwill be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 demonstrating, in accordance \nwith the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant \nto produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).3 \n \nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. It is \nbecause of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to such \ninformation. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such \ninformation. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this \nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the Government\u2019s concern: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \n \n2 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n3\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 sets out the following conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; and \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business \ninterests in another country. \n \n \nAt the time the SOR was issued, Applicant held dual citizenship with Taiwan and \nthe U.S., and held a valid Taiwanese passport because it was his belief that he was \nrequired to demonstrate he was a Taiwanese citizen in order to inherit property from his \nfather. AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) has been raised by the evidence.  \n \n \nThree Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 11 are potentially \nmitigating to this disqualifying condition: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and  \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship was derived from his parents and/or residence in \nTaiwan. Applicant exceeded the requirement to express a willingness to renounce his \ndual citizenship by formally renouncing his Taiwanese citizenship as well as \nsurrendering his Taiwanese passport to the Taiwanese government in November 2008. \nConfirmation of this was acknowledged by the Taiwanese government in December \n2008. He took such action being uncertain of the collateral affects it would have on his \ninheritance rights, desiring to comply with DoD requirements for a security clearance. \nThis concern is deemed mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a), 11(b), and 11(e). \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n[I]f the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent \ncontact with his older sister and to a lesser extent his remaining siblings in Taiwan. \nThese close relationships create a potential risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion meriting a close examination of all circumstances. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying \nconditions as a result of Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented. The \nGovernment established Applicant\u2019s siblings are resident citizens of Taiwan, and that \nApplicant maintains frequent contact with them by telephone and infrequent travel. The \n\n \n9 \n \n \nGovernment also identified the concerns associated with Applicant\u2019s potential \ninheritance of his father\u2019s apartment in Taiwan. The burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \n \n \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplying common sense and life experience, there is a rebuttable presumption \nthat a person has ties of affection for, and/or obligation to his immediate family. ISCR \nCase No. 04-07766 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006); ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. \nBd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has demonstrated the indicia of ties of affection for/and or \nobligation to siblings by telephone as well as his travel to Taiwan in 2003 and 2006.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s siblings are not associated with or affiliated with the Taiwanese \ngovernment. His two sisters are retired and his two brothers are respectively employed \nas a physician and a dentist. The record does not identify what influence, if any, the \nTaiwanese government could exert on Applicant\u2019s siblings as a result of their being \nresident citizens of Taiwan. However, their presence in Taiwan and Applicant\u2019s foreign \ntravel create concerns under this Guideline. As such, the burden shifted to Applicant to \nshow his relatives in Taiwan and travel there does not create security risks.  \n \n\u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved in the case, and the intelligence-\ngathering history of that government are important evidence that provides context for all \nthe other evidence of the record . . .\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-0776 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSept. 26, 2006); see also ISCR Case No. 02-07772 at 7 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2003). As \nnoted supra under the subheading \u201cTaiwan,\u201d Taiwan actively engages in intelligence \ngathering against the U.S.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant denies having \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d between the U.S. and any foreign \ncountry. It should be noted Applicant\u2019s allegiance to the U.S. was not challenged in this \nproceeding. The issue is rather a positional one.  \n \n[Guideline B] hinges not on what choice Applicant might make if he is \nforced to choose between his loyalty to his family and the United States, \nbut rather hinges on the concept that Applicant should not be placed in a \nposition where he is forced to make such a choice. ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005). \n \nOn balance, Applicant has not met his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood \nthat [his relationship with his in-laws] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d The nature of the Taiwan\u2019s government and its ongoing intelligence \ngathering activities against the U.S. places Applicant in just this position, given his close \nrelationship with his family and their continued presence and connection with Taiwan. \nAccordingly, Mitigating Conditions 8(a) and 8(b) do not apply. On the other hand, the \naffirmative steps Applicant has taken by renouncing his Taiwanese citizenship and \nsurrendering his Taiwanese passport to Taiwanese authorities may preclude him from \ninheriting property from his parents. When compared with having no assets in Taiwan \nand having little or no likelihood of acquiring property in Taiwan through inheritance and \nhis substantial assets in the U.S., application of Mitigating Condition 8(f) is appropriate \nfor SOR \u00b6 2.c. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \n In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d4 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the \neighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.5 In addition to the \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007) (citing Raffone v. \nAdams, 468 F.2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). \n \n5 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the \neighth APF apparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. \nBd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for \nexploitation\u201d), but see ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that \neighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n11 \n \n \neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense \ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.    \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.; \nand many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to Taiwan. Several circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole \nperson analysis. First, and most importantly for security purposes, Taiwan actively \nseeks classified and industrial/economic information. Taiwan may attempt to use \nApplicant\u2019s siblings who live in Taiwan to obtain such information. Also, Applicant spent \nhis formative years in Taiwan. Applicant has visited Taiwan three times recently, i.e. one \ntime in 2003 and two times in 2006. Applicant also maintains frequent contact with his \nolder sister and to a lesser extent his remaining siblings in Taiwan. These contacts and \nvisits are manifestations of strong affection and regard Applicant has for family \nmembers in Taiwan.   \n \n \n \nThere is substantial mitigating evidence that weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance. Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1987 to pursue his graduate \nstudies, and has continuously lived in the U.S. for the past 22 years. His wife and oldest \nson became U.S. citizens, and his youngest son was born in the U.S. His assets in the \nU.S. are substantial when contrasted to his uncertain assets in Taiwan. He is a U.S. \ncitizen and U.S. passport holder. His ties to the United States are stronger than his ties \nto his siblings in Taiwan. He has vested his life and future in the U.S. There is no \nevidence Applicant has ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the \nUnited States. He takes his loyalty to the United States very seriously, and he has \nworked diligently for a Government contractor since June 2007. The evidence contains \nno derogatory record evidence about the Applicant. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Taiwan. Taiwan is a multi-\nparty democracy. In the unlikely event that Applicant\u2019s family in Taiwan was subjected \nto coercion or duress from the Taiwanese government in an attempt to obtain sensitive \ninformation, I find that because of his deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the U.S., that Applicant would resolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress in favor of the United States. Noteworthy is the affirmative and \novert steps Applicant recently took to formally renounce his Taiwanese citizenship and \nsurrender his Taiwanese passport to the Taiwanese government, at the risk of negating \nhis inheritance rights. \n \n \nThis case must be adjudged on his own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                                          \nanalysis. This Analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \nunder the facts presented that the Taiwanese government or its agents might exploit or \nattempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s family members in such a way that this U.S. citizen would \nhave to choose between his pledged loyalty to the U.S. and those family members. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence and preference.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d6 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \n \n                  Paragraph 2, Guideline B: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 2.d.: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance \nfor Applicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n \n6See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 27, 2007. On \nOctober 1, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines E and K. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nJune 28, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on October 15, 2009; answered it on November 13, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on November 18, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n31, 2010, and the case was assigned to me on February 5, 2010. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on March 2, 2010, scheduling the hearing for March 31, 2010. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 10 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of four \nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through G, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 12, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He \nadmitted some of the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 2.a-2.c but provided \nexculpatory explanations. I have treated his answers to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and \n2.a-2.c as denials. Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old reliability engineer employed by a defense contractor. \nHe received a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering technology in 1983 and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in reliability engineering in 1995. He has worked for his current \nemployer since October 1985. He has held a security clearance since August 1988. \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, who has known him for about 25 years and supervised \nhim for about 15 years, regards him as honest, ethical, and \u201cabsolutely law-abiding.\u201d He \nhas \u201cabsolutely no doubts\u201d about his suitability for a security clearance. (Tr. 91-92.) A \ncoworker from 1985 to 1989 and a long-time friend testified that Applicant has a good \nreputation for honesty, integrity, and being a law-abiding citizen. (Tr. 103.) Another \ncoworker for 21 years testified he is very honest. (Tr. 111.) A third coworker for 10 years \ntestified he has a very good reputation for honesty and obeying the law. (Tr. 118.) \n \n \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c are based on another Government agency\u2019s \nreport that Applicant admitted the conduct alleged in the SOR. The record does not \ninclude the other agency\u2019s report, nor does it include any documents from that agency \nreflecting the circumstances or content of Applicant\u2019s communication with that agency. \nThe only evidence regarding the conduct alleged in the SOR was provided by Applicant \nin his answer to the SOR, his response to DOHA interrogatories (GX 4 and GX 5), a \npersonal subject interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (GX 6), and his testimony at the hearing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents emigrated from a foreign country and became U.S. citizens in \nthe early 1960s. In July 1986, before Applicant was granted a clearance, his uncle and \na diplomat from his parents\u2019 native country, with whom Applicant\u2019s uncle had served in \nthe armed forces of that country, visited his parents\u2019 home. Applicant visited his parents \non the way home from work and was introduced to the diplomat. The diplomat asked \nApplicant who he worked for and what he did. Applicant told him the name of his \n\n \n3 \n \n \nemployer, mentioned some unclassified program names, and explained the duties of a \nreliability engineer (\u201cdetermine how long a piece of equipment will last before any kind \nof action is required to also ensure that the equipment is safe\u201d). The diplomat did not \nprobe for details. The conversation lasted about 15 minutes, and Applicant never had \nany further contact with the diplomat. Applicant disclosed this contact with a foreign \ndiplomat during polygraph interviews with another agency in 1994 and in 1997. (GX 4 at \n4-6; GX 6 at 3; Tr. 42-44.) \n \n \nAlthough Applicant has held a clearance for most of the time he has worked for \nhis current employer, he has worked on only one classified project that continued from \n1994 to 1997. He did not work on any classified projects before 1994 or after 1997. (AX \nB; Tr. 29-33.) During his work on the classified project, he worked in an enclosed, \nsecure area, and he was not allowed to remove any documents from that area. (Tr. 31-\n32.)  \n \n \nDuring security interviews with another agency in 1997, Applicant told an \ninvestigator that he routinely worked on \u201ccompany confidential\u201d materials at home. None \nof the materials were classified Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret by the Department of \nDefense. His employer has changed the term \u201ccompany confidential\u201d to \u201cproprietary\u201d to \navoid confusion. (Answer to SOR at 1-2; GX 4 at 6, 9.) \n \n \nApplicant worked at home for about two weeks on one project that was marked \n\u201cFor Official Use Only.\u201d He was directed by his supervisor to coordinate with a \ncommercial graphics firm that was printing materials pertaining to the project. (Tr. 34-\n36.) Applicant testified that employees were encouraged to work at home to meet \ndeadlines and that his employer had upgraded the office software so that engineers \ncould work at home. (Tr. 38-39.) He admitted to the security investigator that he \ninadvertently left about 100 pages of \u201cconfidential\u201d marked-up drafts of the graphics at \nhome during the project. (Tr. 47.) He denied using the word \u201csecret\u201d in his security \ninterview. He believed that the interviewer thought all working documents were \nclassified because the interview took place at a location where everything was \nclassified. (Tr. 63-64.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he believed that the limitations on use and distribution of \nproprietary information prohibited disclosure to competitors, but they did not preclude \ntaking the material home, working on it at home, or traveling with it. (Tr. 62.) His \nsupervisor testified that \u201ccasual overtime\u201d using proprietary materials is encouraged, \nand that the company had spent \u201cquite a bit of money\u201d to provide secure software and \nfacilitate working off-site. (Tr. 87-91.) Propriety information is required to be properly \nmarked, but there is no requirement that it be stored in a locked container. (Tr. 94-96.) \n \nIn November 1990, Applicant was denied eligibility for access to sensitive \ncompartmented information (SCI) by another agency. (GX 9; Answer to SOR, \nAttachments 1 and 2.) He asked for the basis of the denial and the responsible agency \nprovided him with a \u201cclearance decision summary\u201d reflecting that he was interviewed by \na security investigator \u201cand was unable to successfully complete security processing.\u201d \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe agency concluded that it was \u201cunable to make an assessment of his ability to meet\u201d \nthe criteria for SCI access without his \u201cfull cooperation.\u201d (Answer to SOR, Attachment \n6.) In May 1991, the agency determined that Applicant was eligible to reapply for SCI \naccess if his employer sponsored him. (GX 10). He reapplied, with his employer\u2019s \nsponsorship, and he was granted SCI eligibility in May 1994. It was administratively \nterminated in April 2000 because he no longer needed it. (GX 8 at 3.) \n \nApplicant testified that when he received the \u201cclearance decision summary,\u201d he \nbelieved that his SCI application was disapproved because he had problems with the \npolygraph. He testified, \u201cThey kept telling me to relax when I was having the test, and I \nwas like I was trying to relax, and they were yelling at me to relax, and one thing led to \nanother and then that was the end.\u201d (Tr. 68.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted security clearance applications in September 2004 \nand April 2007, he answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions asking if he had ever had a \nclearance or access authorization denied, suspended or revoked. He did not disclose \non either application that he had been denied SCI eligibility in November 1990. (GX 1 at \nSection 26b; GX 2 at Question 32.) \n \n \nAccording to Applicant, when his SCI application was denied in 1990, his \ncompany security manager told him that the action on his SCI application was not a \ndenial, and that he should not treat it as a denial because he was authorized to resubmit \nhis application. (Tr. 55, 79.) The security manager informed him that no record of the \ndecision on SCI access would be maintained in his employer\u2019s security file \u201cor \ncomparable government system.\u201d Applicant was advised \u201cto only reveal the denial for \naccess to SCI if [he] was specifically asked for any letters\u201d regarding his security history. \n(GX 7 at 3.) On June 4, 2008, and September 12, 2008, Applicant provided copies of \nthe documents pertaining to his SCI denial in response to DOHA interrogatories. (GX 5 \nat 6, 13-14; GX 7 at 4-9.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s security manager retired in March 2002, but he provided a written \nsworn statement for the hearing, in which stated that he \u201cmay have advised\u201d Applicant \nthat his SCI access was not denied. (AX F.) Applicant\u2019s current special security officer \nsubmitted a statement supporting Applicant\u2019s recollection of the previous security \nmanager\u2019s advice. (AX G.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n\n \n5 \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that another Government agency reported that Applicant \nadmitted removing classified information from his workplace for several years and \n\n \n6 \n \n \nadmitted discussing classified information with a non-U.S. citizen and family members \n(SOR 1.a). It also alleges that, from approximately 1985 through 1997, he removed \nclassified material from his workplace (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that in the mid-1980\u2019s he \ndiscussed classified information with his mother, father, uncle, and a foreign diplomat \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c).  It further alleges that Applicant was denied SCI access by another agency \nin 1990 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Finally, it alleges that Applicant falsified his security clearance \napplications in 2004 and 2007 by intentionally failing to disclose that he was denied SCI \naccess in 1990 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f). \n \n \nThe conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is the same conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nand 1.c. When the same conduct is alleged more than once under the same guideline, \none of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). \nAccordingly, I will resolve SOR \u00b6 1.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe evidence on which SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c was based was hearsay several times \nremoved. It was provided by Applicant to an investigator, passed to an adjudicator, \npassed further to the other Government agency, and then finally passed to DOHA. \nWhile hearsay evidence is generally admissible in security clearance proceedings, the \nmultiple levels of hearsay in this case significantly reduced the reliability of the \ninformation.  \n \n \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b that Applicant removed classified materials from his \nworkplace is based on his reported admission during a polygraph examination. The only \nevidence of the content of the polygraph interview was provided by Applicant. The \nevidence reflects that Applicant admitted removing \u201ccompany confidential\u201d information \nwith the approval of his supervisor, and that the other agency\u2019s interviewer \nmisunderstood his admission. His employer\u2019s security procedures made it virtually \nimpossible to remove classified materials from the workplace. Applicant\u2019s reputation for \nhonesty and law-abiding behavior make such a security violation highly unlikely. I found \nApplicant\u2019s account of the polygraph interview plausible and credible. I conclude that he \nhas refuted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n \nThe conversation with the foreign diplomat and Applicant\u2019s family members, \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, occurred in July 1986, shortly after Applicant was hired and well \nbefore he had access to classified information. The only evidence in the record showing \nthe nature of the information that was disclosed was provided by Applicant. The \n\n \n7 \n \n \ninformation disclosed to the diplomat was generic and did not include classified, \nproprietary, or other protected information. I found Applicant\u2019s description of his \nconversation with the foreign diplomat plausible and credible. I conclude that he has \nrefuted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d, and his admission is corroborated \nby the documentary evidence in the record. The record reflects that the SCI denial was \nbased on Applicant\u2019s failure to complete a polygraph examination and not on discovery \nof derogatory information. He was granted SCI eligibility in May 1994. \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense \nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). I \nconclude that the circumstances of the SCI denial, his subsequent receipt of SCI \neligibility, and the passage of time since the denial are sufficient to mitigate security \nconcerns raised by the SCI denial. \n \n \nApplicant admitted his failure to disclose the other agency\u2019s denial of SCI \neligibility on two security clearance applications, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, but \nhe denied intentional falsification. When a falsification allegation is controverted, as in \nthis case, the government has the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, \ndoes not prove falsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence \nas a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See \nISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). I conclude the evidence is \nsufficient to raise the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire\u201d), shifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nThe relevant mitigating condition is AG \u00b6 17(b):  \n \n[T]he refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully.   \n \n \nApplicant testified that he relied on the advice of his security manager. He \nprovided the documents pertaining to his SCI denial in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories. The security manager\u2019s advice and Applicant\u2019s explanation were \nplausible in light of the circumstances of the SCI denial, which arose from his inability or \nfailure to complete a polygraph examination rather than the discovery of derogatory \n\n \n8 \n \n \nevidence. Applicant\u2019s explanation was corroborated, albeit to a limited degree, by the \nstatements from his former security manager and current security manager. I found \nApplicant to be sincere, candid, and credible at the hearing. I conclude that the \nmitigating condition in AG \u00b6 17(b) is established. \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c under this \nguideline. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 33 as follows: \u201cDeliberate \nor negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified or other \nsensitive information raises doubt about an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, \nreliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious \nsecurity concern.\u201d The relevant disqualifying conditions are set out in AG \u00b6 34 as \nfollows: \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of classified or other protected \ninformation to unauthorized persons, including but not limited to personal \nor business contacts, to the media, or to persons present at seminars, \nmeetings, or conferences; and \n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or \nin any other unauthorized location; \n \nAs noted above in the discussion of Guideline E, the allegation that Applicant \ndisclosed classified information to family members and a foreign diplomat was refuted. \nUnder Guideline K, disclosure of \u201cother protected information\u201d may raise a disqualifying \ncondition. There is no evidence that Applicant disclosed \u201cother protected information\u201d to \nhis family members or the foreign diplomat during their brief meeting in July 1986. There \nalso is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s storage of protected but unclassified information at \nhome violated any directives or company instructions. Thus, I conclude that no \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline are raised. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n9 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and K in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult. He has worked for his employer for \nmost of his adult life and held a clearance for many years. He was candid, sincere, \narticulate, and credible at the hearing. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guidelines E and K, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based on \npersonal conduct and handling protected information. Accordingly, I conclude he has \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ncontinue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline K:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

On March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising under Guideline\nD (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response notarized on March 30, 2009, Applicant admitted all four\nallegations set forth under Guideline D. He denied one allegation and failed to answer\nthe second allegation noted under Guideline E. In his response to the SOR, Applicant\nrequested a determination without a hearing. Consequently, Department Counsel\nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated August 17, 2009, that included six\nattached items. Applicant timely responded to the FORM on September 21, 2009. On\nSeptember 30, 2009, the Director, DOHA, forwarded the case for assignment to an\nOctober 30, 2009\n\n See SF-86 at 3-4.\n      1\n The adult website at issue is not limited to chat rooms or pictures in general, but has rooms organized by\n      2\nrating (G, R, and X), including others \u201clabeled as intended for people interested in specific sexual themes,\nsuch as tattoos and piercings, bisexuality, nudism, and bondage.\u201d FORM at 11.\n Response to SOR at 2. Elsewhere, Applicant stated that the government\u2019s insinuation that the web site\u2019s\n      3\n\u201ccriminal behavior is pervasive and unavoidable\u201d is flawed.

I received the case on October 9, 2009. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden\nregarding the security concerns raised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old researcher who has worked for the same defense\ncontractor since 2003. He earned degrees at both the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s level\nfrom well-regarded colleges. He subsequently served as an officer in the military\nreserves for approximately five years, during which time he married.1\nIn choosing to have an administrative determination without a hearing,\nApplicant\u2019s facts and arguments are essentially limited to those put forth in the FORM,\nin his answer to the SOR, and in his response to the FORM. Consequently, the relevant\nfacts of record are scant. \nApplicant admitted to all four allegations arising under Guideline D, Sexual\nBehavior.  Specifically, he admitted SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a (\u201cYou visited an adult chat\nroom on a website from about 1996 to at least March 2006 where on occasion child\npornography would appear\u201d) and \u00b6 1.b (\u201cYou viewed child pornography that appeared\non your computer when you visited an adult website from 1996 to at least March\n2006\").  Applicant explained that \u201cit is untrue to say that [he] knew illegal material would\n2\nappear at the website in question,\u201d but conceded that \u201c[i]n my experience, these were\nalways rare events and eventually they stopped.\u201d  After his first exposure to illegal\n3\nimagery and with an underage sex chat participant, he sought \u201cto identify by type of\nusername the sorts of people most likely to post illegal materials\u201d and to avoid on-line\ncontact with them.  \n4\nSuch instances were eventually repeated. Over time, the website instituted\nincreasingly more rigorous attempts to keep participants and their postings at a legal\nlevel.  By 2004, the web site specifically prohibited \u201cLolita Pics.\u201d  Applicant admitted he\n5\n6\nsaw illegal images six or eight times \u201cover the years,\u201d but could only \u201cspecifically\n\n Id. at 3. Elsewhere, Applicant stated the number of times such images were viewed was closer to three\n      7\nor four. Response to FORM at 18.\n Response to the SOR at 3.\n      8\n Response to FORM at 6.\n      9\n Id.\n      10\n Id. at 18. Applicant states he remains \u201cmarried to the same woman and she has never raised the topic.\u201d\n      11\nId. at 7. Applicant further noted that he received training with regard to the appropriate procedures for\nreporting \u201cencounters with foreign national prostitutes abroad.\u201d Id. at 1. None of the allegations concern\ncontact with prostitutes, foreign or domestic.\n Id. at 7.\n      12\n Id. at 7. Applicant further explains the popularity of on-line sex chat rooms and sex-oriented role playing\n      13\ngames while depicting the web site at issue, which features an extensive variety of sexual and nonsexual sub-\ndomains, as \u201cwithin the mainstream of this cultural phenomenon.\u201d Id.at 7-8.\n Id. at 4. There is similarly no evidence that Applicant has what is termed in the materials as a \u201creptilian\n      14\nbrain.\u201d See, e.g., Id. at 5. \n FORM at 19. Consequently, Applicant feels Sexual Conduct Mitigating Condition 17(f) applies.\n      15\n3\nremember two [instances or images],\u201d occurring in 1996 and in \u201cperhaps 1998.\u201d7\nApplicant is \u201cunable to recall the last time\u201d he saw \u201csuch an image.\u201d  \n8\nIn response to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c (\u201cYou joined phone sex lines and\nmasturbated while on-line to at least March 2005\"), Applicant admitted he used\ntelephonic or on-line chat rooms of a sexual nature at various times. In 1996 he\nengaged in an on-line sex chat with a minor.  Later, in 1999, he curtailed another on-\n9\nline sexual conversation when he discovered the person with whom he was chatting\nidentified herself as a minor. Applicant, however, had \u201cno way of verifying\u201d the sex or\nage of this person.  Applicant\u2019s \u201cwife, boss, the security officer at [his] company, the\n10\nPresident and Vice President of [his] company, and to a lesser degree several of [his]\nclosest friends all know what has happened,\u201d although there is no evidence as to the\nextent of their knowledge regarding these activities.  Applicant stated his use of on-line\n11\nsex chat \u201cmanifestly would not\u201d affect his personal, professional or community\nstanding.  He argues that \u201csex chat\u201d is \u201cwell within community standards and has been\n12\nsince the World Wide Web began to be popular.\u201d  \n13\nFinally, Applicant admitted SOR allegation \u00b6 1.d (\u201cYour personal computer,\nlaptop, and hard drive were surrendered to an Other Government Agency for inspection\nduring an investigation pertaining to child pornography in about August 2005\").\nApplicant noted he voluntarily complied with the investigators\u2019 requests. He also stated\nthat no illegal materials were found. Applicant does not have a prurient interest in child\npornography.  Applicant argued that his statements to investigators prior to the\n14\nexamination of his computers and prior to this process were distorted.  \n15\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      16\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      17\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      18\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.\nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied\nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe United States Government (Government) must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for\npresenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts\nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is\n16\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion\n17\nis on the applicant.  \n18\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\n\n Id.\n      19\n Id.\n      20\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n      21\n AG \u00b6 12.\n      22\n Id.\n      23\n5\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n19\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such information.  The\n20\ndecision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of an applicant,  nor does it reflect badly on that person\u2019s character. It is\n21\nmerely an indication that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline D (Sexual Behavior)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions\npertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and\ndiscussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline D \u2013 Sexual Behavior\nUnder Guideline D, \u201csexual behavior that involves a criminal offense indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  It further states that \u201cno adverse inference concerning the standards in\n22\nthis Guideline may be raised on the basis of sexual orientation of the individual.\u201d  The\n23\nDirective sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this Guideline. \nFor a decade, from 1996 until at least 2006, Applicant frequented a website\nfeaturing a wide variety of sexual components. He regularly visited the website, viewed\nits contents, and used it and telephonic technology to conduct sexual \u201cchats.\u201d These\n\u201cchats\u201d included a sex \u201cchat\u201d with a minor. He persisted with the \u201cchat\u201d function on the\nwebsite and eventually had a second conversation of a sexual nature with an individual\nwho was apparently underage. Through the website, he also viewed an image of child\npornography. While continuing to use the website, he witnessed similar images. Such\nfacts give rise to Sexual Behavior Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 13(a) (\u201csexual behavior\nof a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted\u201d), \u00b6 13(c)\n(\u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or\nduress\u201d), and \u00b6 13(d) (\u201csexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of\ndiscretion or judgment\u201d). \n\n Applicant\u2019s Response to the SOR. There is no evidence as to whether he has since resumed this\n      24\nbehavior at the website at issue or any other websites.\n Applicant\u2019s Response to the SOR regarding SOR allegation \u00b6 1(c).\n      25\n See, e.g., Response to FORM at 6.\n      26\n6\nApplicant\u2019s on-line activities with the adult website at issue occurred during his\n30s and 40s. Consequently, Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition (SB MC) AG \u00b6 14(a)\n(\u201cthe behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no evidence of\nsubsequent conduct of a similar nature\u201d) does not apply.\nApplicant used the adult website from about 1996 until at least 2006.  As well,\n24\nhe sought sexual gratification through his use of phone sex lines and the website until\nat least 2005.  After he first discovered minors could and would actively use the adult\n25\nwebsite at issue and learned that illegal images were periodically available on the site,\nhe continued to visit the site. He did so in the knowledge that he could not verify the age\nor sex of those with whom he had sex chats or predict when illegal imagery would be\nposted for access.  \n26\nThe government argues that Applicant returned to the website after he first\ndiscovered \u201ccrime was afoot.\u201d Applicant stressed that underage contacts and illegal\nimagery were not pervasive and that he tried avoid them, despite the fact he also\nacknowledged one could not discern a participant\u2019s true age or gender. Regardless,\nboth the methods he used to avoid such content and the website\u2019s measures at\ncensorship were imperfect. As a result, he had a subsequent conversation with a minor\nand he viewed more illegal images. While these incidents were intermittent, his initial\nexperiences gave him sufficient warning that such content was sporadically available\nand relatively unavoidable. \nWhether Applicant chooses to properly use adult websites or sex chats for his\nown personal entertainment is not the issue. The issue is his voluntary and continued\nuse of an adult site he knew to be insufficiently censored and which he knew could\nintermittently or randomly feature illegal or inappropriate content. As noted above, a\nperson seeking a security clearance enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based on trust and confidence. This relationship continues after working\nhours. It is founded on trust and the expectation that an applicant reliably and\nconsistently demonstrates sound judgment. In continuing to revisit the website for\nnearly 10 years, Applicant did little more than repeatedly throw the dice in the hopes he\ncould enjoy uncensored sex chat while avoiding illegal contacts. Such behavior\ndemonstrates unreliable conduct and poor judgment that is not mitigated under SB MC\nAG \u00b6 14(b) (\u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d).\nAt this point, Applicant\u2019s wife, professional superiors, and some close friends\nknow of his adult activities. Now that they know of his use of what he depicts as\n\n This mitigating condition would not necessarily apply to friends, family, professional colleagues, or other\n      27\nsocial contacts, past or future, not explicitly enumerated above.\n AG \u00b6 15.\n      28\n7\n\u201cmainstream\u201d entertainment, he feels he is no longer vulnerable to exploitation by\nanyone seeking details regarding any classified or sensitive information. To the extent\nhis wife, his current employers, and some selected friends know of his activities, SB MC\nAG \u00b6 14(c) (\u201cthe behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress\u201d) applies in part.  With regard to telephonic or on-line sexual activities or\n27\ncontent not involving minors, whether solitary or interactive, SB MC AG \u00b6 14(d) (\u201cthe\nsexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet\u201d) applies.\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Here, Applicant repeatedly used modern technology to engage in sexual\n28\n\u201cchats\u201d and view sexual images. He engaged in these activities in his pursuit of\nentertainment and, at times, for sexual gratification. His activities are now known by a\nhandful of individuals, including his wife, workplace associates, and \u201cto a lesser degree\nseveral of [his] closest friends.\u201d While these individuals may know of Applicant\u2019s\nactivities, there are insufficient facts of record from which to discern whether this\ninformation has affected how these individuals view Applicant as an individual,\ncolleague, or peer. Moreover, the selectivity of this finite circle of intimates is notable\nand fails to demonstrate that Applicant is actually comfortable with such knowledge\nbeing possessed by others within his personal, professional, or civic circles.\nConsequently, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 16(e) (\u201cpersonal\nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if\nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing, or (2)\nwhile in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for\nexploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other group\u201d)\napplies.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct continued for close to a decade, lasting through at least\n2006. During that time, he was exposed to illegal content or compromising situations on\nmultiple occasions. Therefore, Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) AG \u00b6\n17(c) (\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d) does not apply. \nMoreover, while Applicant\u2019s admissions note that he curtailed his use of\ntelephonic sex lines in 2005 and his visits to the website at issue in 2006, and while\n\n8\nthere is no evidence he preserved illegal content on his computers, there is no\naffirmative commitment expressed that he will not again return to that website or to any\nsimilar website on which illegal or compromising materials may be a regular or\nrandomly intermittent feature. Further, there is no evidence that he has disclosed, or is\neither prepared or willing to disclose, the facts of record to other individuals within his\nspheres of contact who have not already been informed of his activities. Consequently,\nPC MC AG \u00b6 17(e) (\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d) does not apply. None of the other\nmitigating conditions under this guideline apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes;\n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Multiple facts speak in Applicant\u2019s favor. Applicant is a mature man with\nimpressive educational and professional credentials. He devoted a significant period of\nhis life to being a military reservist. When asked by investigators whether his computers\ncould be examined, he voluntarily complied. In the end, apparently no illegal materials\nwere discovered and Applicant was essentially vindicated of maintaining such materials\non his computers. Although he chose an administrative determination in lieu of a\nhearing, his submissions demonstrate that he is a capable advocate. In foregoing a\nhearing, however, the record consists only of written documents, precluding the\nopportunity for inquiry to be made in those areas in which questions remain and\nconcerns linger. \nMultiple facts also exist which speak against Applicant. While he was fully within\nhis rights to pursue adult entertainment in the privacy of his home, he chose to\n\n9\nrepeatedly revisit an adult website on which he had engaged in sexual chatter with a\nminor and on which he had encountered an illegal image of a pornographic nature.\nRather than avoid that site and move to a better monitored adult service, he regularly\nreturned to the same website for a decade. During that time, he again encountered a\npresumably underage chat partner and more illegal images. While such illegal content\nwas neither pervasive nor a regular feature on the site, he was aware that censorship of\nsuch material was imperfect and not foolproof. Each time he accessed the site, he\nvoluntarily assumed the risk that he would again be compromised with similar material\nor contact. Trust and confidence, however, are not built on risk-taking. It is built on the\ndemonstrated exercise of reliability, trustworthiness, and sound judgment. Given the\nfacts and arguments submitted, such qualities were not sufficiently demonstrated so as\nto overcome lingering security concerns. Any reasonable doubt about whether an\napplicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of\nprotecting such information. Because Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior and personal conduct\nsecurity concerns remain unmitigated, I conclude it is not clearly consistent with\nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn July 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 25, 2008 and October 3, 2008, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to an \nadministrative judge on December 8, 2008, and reassigned to another administrative \njudge on January 5, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 12, 2009, \nscheduling the case for January 27, 2009. Applicant was granted a continuance based \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nupon a death in the family. The case was reassigned to me on March 20, 2009. DOHA \nissued another notice of hearing on March 23, 2009, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on April 9, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which \nwere received without objection. The Government also offered a demonstrative exhibit \nwhich was marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified on his own behalf but did \nnot submit any documentary evidence. The record was held open for Applicant to \nsubmit documentary evidence. Applicant submitted 14 pages of documents, which were \nmarked AE A through I, and admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s \nmemorandum is marked HE II. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nApril 17, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 1998. From 1998 through 2002, he worked in one state. In \n2002, his company transferred him to the state where he currently lives. He served on \nactive duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1980 to 1993, when he was honorably discharged \nas a technical sergeant (E-6). He has maintained a security clearance throughout his \nmilitary career and most of his post-military employment. He has an associate\u2019s degree \nawarded in 1992. He has been married since 2003, having been married and divorced \ntwice previously. He has three children from his first marriage, ages 23, 21, and 19. He \nalso has a seven-year-old stepchild.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts. Twelve of the debts total $69,131, and \nthere is a delinquent mortgage loan. Applicant denied all the allegations in his answer to \nthe SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant was married to his second wife from 1991 to 2002. The marriage \nended abruptly when he discovered his wife was being unfaithful. She moved out of \ntheir house and she filed for divorce shortly thereafter. She was represented by an \nattorney; he was not. Applicant consented and the court ordered, that he pay $300 per \nmonth in spousal support for three years. Division of liabilities was apparently not \nspecifically addressed in the court order.2  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s former wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy about the same time as the \ndivorce was pending. The exact dates when the bankruptcy was filed and her debts \ndischarged are unclear, but Applicant believes they occurred before the divorce was \nfinal. When he learned that she filed bankruptcy, he discussed it with his supervisor. \nThe supervisor advised him to obtain legal advice and, if necessary, that he would lend \nApplicant the money for a lawyer. Applicant stated that he refused the loan because he \ndid not want to borrow money from a supervisor and he realized that he would have to \npay the money back. He sought and received free legal advice at the local legal aid \noffice. He asked the legal aid attorney how his wife\u2019s bankruptcy petition affected him. \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 17-21, 37-38, 41; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 19-23, 30; GE 2; AE B-I. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nHe was advised that their joint debts were discharged and that he was no longer \nresponsible for the debts. The attorney told him that he should inform any creditors that \nthe debts were discharged in bankruptcy and were no longer his responsibility. He \ninformed the creditors of this fact and he stopped receiving collection phone calls and \ncollection notices. He was also informed that the debts would remain on his credit report \nfor some time, but would eventually fall off the report.3  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s separation and divorce exacted a financial toll on him. He was paying \na large amount in child support to his first wife. He and his wife were barely making \nends meet with their combined incomes when they were together. She handled the \nfamily\u2019s finances because he was frequently traveling for work. After the separation, it \nbecame difficult to meet all the bills. In the summer of 2002, Applicant was offered the \nopportunity to transfer and work with the same company in another state. He relocated \nshortly after the divorce was finalized. The house in the original state went into \nforeclosure and was eventually lost to foreclosure. It is unclear if there was any \ndeficiency owed on the mortgage after the house was sold. Applicant thought the \nmortgage was included in his wife\u2019s bankruptcy and he was absolved of any liability if \nthere was a deficiency.4  \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the debts in the SOR because he honestly believed they \nwere no longer valid debts. The only debt that he does not admit was a legitimate debt \nbefore the bankruptcy is the $199 debt to a collection company on behalf of a public \nutility. He thought this was a utility bill from while he was still in the Air Force, which he \nthought he had paid. This debt is listed on the June 14, 2007 credit report, but not the \ncredit report of January 22, 2009. Applicant was very credible and convincing in his \ntestimony about the advice from the legal aid attorney, and his actions in reliance upon \nthat advice. When he was informed that the discharge of his wife\u2019s debts in bankruptcy \ndid not affect his liability for the debts, he appeared genuinely surprised and distraught.5  \n \n \nAfter the bankruptcy, Applicant continued to pay the accounts that were solely in \nhis name. He paid the spousal support for the full three years. He maintained his child \nsupport payments. He was informed that he owed the IRS for his 2001 taxes and he \npaid the IRS through a 12-month payment plan. Several of the debts listed in the SOR \nare not listed on the most recent credit report in evidence. Many of the remaining debts \nwill soon reach the seven-year credit report limit for reporting adverse entries. Applicant \nis current on his taxes. His children are now adults and he no longer pays child support. \nHe does not owe any back child support.6  \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 21-25; GE 2. \n \n4 Tr. at 26-30; GE 2, 4, 5. \n \n5 Tr. at 22-28, 36; GE 2-5. \n6 Tr. at 30-31, 38-41; GE 2-5. \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and did not pay his \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were related to a costly separation and divorce. \nHis wife had her debts discharged in bankruptcy. Applicant sought legal advice from the \nlocal legal aid office to find out how his wife\u2019s bankruptcy affected his legal liabilities. He \nwas told that the bankruptcy also absolved him of liability for the debts. He acted on the \nadvice and has not done anything in the last seven years to address the debts. The \nadvice was legally incorrect, but Applicant\u2019s reliance on the advice was not \nunreasonable. I find that the bad legal advice clearly is a circumstance that it is unlikely \nto recur and the behavior happened so long ago that it does not cast doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is \napplicable. I find that both the divorce and the bad legal advice qualify as conditions that \nwere outside his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Applicant followed what he considered to be valid legal \nadvice. That is not irresponsible conduct even if the advice was legally incorrect. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is partially applicable. No other mitigating condition is applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. This is a unique \ncase. Applicant honestly believed the legal advice that when his ex-wife\u2019s bankruptcy \ndischarged the joint marital debts, his responsibility for the debts was also discharged. \nThat advice was wrong, but he acted in good faith upon it. The divorce and bankruptcy \n\n \n7 \n \nwere both almost seven years ago. His finances are otherwise in order. He is an \nhonorably discharged veteran and has a stable work history. AG \u00b6 18 sets out the \nsecurity concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations. It discusses two \nsimilar but not identical concerns. The first is that \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s \nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack \nof judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d Applicant has lived within his means for the last seven years. He \nreasonably followed legal advice and did not pay debts that he honestly thought were \nno longer valid debts. Under the unique circumstances of this case, that did not indicate \npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. It \nalso does not raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. The second concern identified in AG \u00b6 18 is that \u201c[a]n individual \nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d Applicant is not truly overextended. While some of the debts still appeared on \nthe credit report of January 22, 2009, many have likely already fallen off or will shortly \nfall off his credit report. The creditors have long ago stopped pursuing Applicant and \nthey are very likely barred from judicial action by the various statutes of limitations. The \nAppeal Board has looked with skepticism at an applicant who relies on the statute of \nlimitations to avoid paying his or her debts.7 That is clearly not the current case. \nApplicant did not initiate the bankruptcy; he did not join in his wife\u2019s bankruptcy petition; \nhe did not file his own bankruptcy; and he did not sit idly by waiting until the creditors \ncould no longer enforce their debts. He simply and honestly followed what turned out to \nbe bad legal advice. That does not adversely reflect on his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n7 \u201cThe fact that Applicant may be insulated from collection actions with respect to a number of [his] debts \ndue to the running of [his] state\u2019s statute of limitations is of little mitigative value. The Board has \npreviously noted that reliance on a statute of limitations does not constitute a good faith effort to resolve \nfinancial difficulties.\u201d ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008). \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December 6,\n2006. On July 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 11, 2008. He requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on December\n16, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 18, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on March 5, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1-5,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf and\npresented the testimony of one witness. He submitted Exhibits (AE) A-B which were\nMarch 27, 2009\n\n2\nadmitted into the record. I held the record open until March 12, 2009, for any documents\nthat Applicant wished to submit. Applicant timely submitted one document, which was\nmarked as AE C, and entered into the record without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on March 23, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 11, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k of the SOR with the exception of two allegations. He\ndenied \u00b6\u00b61.b and 1.h with explanations. He provided additional information to support\nhis request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1989. He has attended college on a part-time basis for several years.\nApplicant served in the United States Air Force (USAF) from 1993 until 1999. He has\nworked for his current employer since 2006 (GE 1). He held a security clearance during\nhis time in the military.\nApplicant married in 1996 and divorced in 1999. He has one child from his first\nmarriage. He suffered some financial difficulties from the divorce. His son lived a great\ndistance from Applicant and he traveled to visit him. This resulted in extra expenses\n(GE 2). Applicant also pays child support.\nAfter Applicant left the military, he had several short periods of unemployment in\n1999. He worked steadily until 2002. He remarried in 2001 and has a step-daughter. His\ncurrent wife has some medical problems. She does not work outside the home at this\ntime.\nApplicant relocated in 2002 to accept new employment. However, shortly after\nthat the company closed. Without any prospects for employment, Applicant filed for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002. His debts were discharged in July 2002 (GE 2).\nWhen he found employment later in 2002, it was not in his field and paid a low\nwage. He also worked for temporary agencies sporadically. Applicant\u2019s income was low\nand he considered himself \u201cunderemployed\u201d from 2002 until 2005. In 2005, Applicant\nfound himself unemployed for several periods of time. He terminated one position\nduring that time due to a pay restructuring (Tr. 17).\nApplicant\u2019s family demands have put financial pressure on him in several ways.\nHis wife\u2019s family needed a place to stay after hurricane Katrina in 2005. He gave them\nfinancial assistance. One of the family members left Applicant with a large utility bill that\nApplicant had to pay (Tr. 22). \n\n3\nApplicant has been steadily employed with his current employer since 2006. He\nhas had some very difficult personal situations arise that have caused additional\nfinancial problems. He had to maintain a separate residence from his wife and her step-\ndaughter. This created additional expense for Applicant. Applicant supported his wife\nand her daughter in their home. His family moved to another state in 2007. He\nmaintained two households at that time. His family moved back shortly after that\nbecause they did not like the location. They left all their belongings in an apartment.\nApplicant traveled a distance to the apartment and packed up all their possessions (Tr.\n19).\nHis step-daughter is a single parent of a child who has disability. He and his wife\nare now caring for the child. He and his wife currently have guardianship and are in the\nprocess of obtaining custody of the grandchild. Recently his step-daughter moved back\nhome. \nThe SOR alleged 9 delinquent debts, including two vehicle repossessions and a\nbankruptcy in 2002. The total amount of delinquent debt is over $20,000. None of the\ndelinquent debts are paid with the exception of one debt (allegation 1.b) in the amount\nof $176.41. His credit reports confirm the delinquent debts (GE 3 ).\nApplicant admitted that the accounts in allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j are\ndelinquent accounts. He also acknowledges that they are not paid with the exception\nnoted above. He does not know the origin of the debt in 1.h ($671). At this time,\nApplicant does not have a payment plan for any of his delinquent debts. He is also\nconsidering bankruptcy. He tried to obtain a loan consolidation but he was denied twice.\nHe sought counseling with a consumer service but he did not have sufficient money to\nuse the service (Tr. 23).\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $1,887.32. After his monthly expenses,\nhe has a net remainder of $17.32. Applicant has $42,000 in student loans. The loans\nare in deferment because he is still in school. He expects to complete his\nundergraduate degree in about one year. At that time he will begin making payments on\nhis student loans. \nApplicant is one of the top performers in his company. His job performance is\nbeyond reproach. He is recommended for a security clearance by his employer (Tr. 48).\nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor praises him as having an exceptional attitude. He is\none of the most valued technicians in the company. He carries out his duties in an\noutstanding manner. He is a motivated person of great integrity (AE B). \nApplicant\u2019s employer highly recommends him. He has a strong work ethic and is\ndedicated to his job. His efforts have produced high quality results time and time again.\nHe is a hard-working self-starter who is a well respected member of his team. Applicant\nis a model employee according to his team lead (AE A). His gets along extremely well\nwith all staff members. \n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n5\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts. He\nadmits that he did not meet his financial obligations from 2002 until the present with the\nexception of one account. His credit reports confirm that he has recent debts as well.\nHis debts were discharged with a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these two potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose from divorce, unemployment, under employment, and family\ncrisis. While those circumstances may have precipitated the debt, the inquiry does not\nend at that point. He has been employed for three years with his current employer. He\nonly paid one of his delinquent debts. He has approximately $20,000 in delinquent debt.\nThis potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant has had unemployment, underemployment, divorce, and a disabled\ngrandchild who needs his help. Applicant reported that he became gainfully employed in\n2006. He helped his family members resolve their financial difficulties but he did not act\nas responsibly as he could have in identifying and resolving his debts. His debts were\n\n6\ndischarged with a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002, which is a legitimate and legal means\nof resolving debt. However, since 2002, he has again unresolved delinquent debt. He\nadmits making poor financial decisions. I find this mitigating condition partially applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received formal financial counseling. He did\nconsult a consumer credit agency to consolidate his debts. He did not have sufficient\nincome to develop a plan with them. He tried to consolidate his delinquent bills with a\nloan but the loan was denied. His promises to pay in the future do not constitute\nevidence of financial reform or resolution of debts. I conclude these mitigating\nconditions partially apply.\nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts\nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. His payment of one delinquent SOR debt and\nhis future plans to pay his debts are simply inadequate to fully mitigate financial\nconsideration security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the military. He\nis highly rated by his employer. He filed for bankruptcy in 2002 due to impending\nunemployment and his debts were discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He has\nsuffered more bouts of unemployment and underemployment. He admitted that he has\nnot said \u201cno\u201d to his family requests for help with their financial difficulties. He is taking\ncare of his grandchild who has a disability. He has worked hard to support his family. He\nhas struggled through difficult times with his family. However, he has no payment plans\nfor his unresolved debts. He has been employed for three years with his current\nemployer.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance is denied. \n \nOn April 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct and Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 30, 2008 and May 9, 2008. She \nelected to have her case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted \nthe government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on June 12, 2008. The FORM was \n \n1 \n \n \nAugust 20, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nsent to Applicant by mail and it was received on June 17, 2008. Applicant was afforded \nan opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Applicant did not object to the FORM and did not submit additional material. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 15, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR with qualifiers. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She was married \nfrom 1995 to 1998 and 1981 to 1991 and divorced twice. She has two grown children, \nages 37 and 29. \n \n \nApplicant has 33 delinquent accounts totally approximately $6,800. In answering \neach allegation she stated \u201cI agree but to the extent.\u201d She did not elaborate on what \u201cto \nthe extent\u201d actually means. She did not provide any proof of payment or resolution \ntoward any of the accounts. The accounts have been referred for collection or charged \noff between one and six years ago. It appears some of the debts are for medical bills, \nbut no explanation was provided. She did make the following statement in the section \n\u201cAdditional Comments\u201d of her security clearance application (SCA): \u201cThere is a Worker\u2019s \nComp case still pending for an injury that occurred when I was employed at [Company]. \nI have not been billed for treatment because the case has not yet been resolved, so no \npayment has been made yet.\u201d Applicant failed to further elaborate on the status of the \nmedical bills alleged.  \n \n \nApplicant also has a federal tax lien in the amount of approximately $35,000 that \nwas entered against her in April 2003. In response to the allegation she stated \u201cWhen \nthe lady came to ask me questions I told her she ask[ed] me something about the IRS \nand I told her I paid $10,000 and have been keeping my income tax each year that was \nthe last I heard.\u201d It is unclear exactly what this explanation means, but it does indicate \nApplicant was aware of a debt to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). She did not \nprovide proof that she paid $10,000 to the IRS, has a payment plan or that the tax lien \nhas been satisfied.  \n \n \nApplicant responded \u201cno\u201d to inquiries on her SCA when asked is she had debts in \nthe last seven years that were over 180 days overdue, and if she had debts that were \ncurrently 90 days overdue. She also answered \u201cno\u201d to an inquiry on her SCA asking if in \nthe last seven years she had a lien placed on her property for failing to pay taxes or \nother debts.1 Her response for why she failed to accurately reflect her financial situation \nwas that she did not remember the questions, she tried to answer everything \u201cthe best \nshe could,\u201d she had never filled out any of the papers for a job before, and had \neverything messed up. She further stated that she is now attempting to get a credit \n \n1 Item 6, Quesitons 27 (c) and 28 (a) and (b).  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nreport so she can contact the creditors.2 It is simply not believable that Applicant did not \nknow that she had any delinquent debts or that she had a tax lien. Applicant has 21 \ndelinquent debts for medical accounts. Four of the other delinquent debts are to four \ndifferent telephone service companies. One delinquent debt is for cable services. One \ndelinquent debt is for Direct TV. It appears four delinquent debts are for some type of \nutilities. One delinquent debt is to a cash store, presumably for a short term loan. Under \nthe circumstances of these facts, I find it inconceivable that Applicant was unaware that \nshe had any delinquent debts. She mentions paying on an IRS debt, which gives \ncredence to the fact she was aware that one existed. I find Applicant intentionally and \ndeliberately falsified information on his SCA by failing to divulge her financial \ndelinquencies.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \n2 Item 5. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n\u201cFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially over-extended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including \nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 for financial \nconsiderations that could raise a security concern and have especially considered AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d). Applicant has a history of delinquent debts that have remained \nunpaid for several years. She admitted she owes the delinquent debts. No information \nwas provided that she has paid the debts or attempted to resolve them. I find both AG \u00b6 \n19 (a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered (a) \n(\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d), (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted \nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d), (c) (\u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \n\n \n5 \n \n \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d), (d) (\u201cthe individual \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d), and \n(e) (\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt \nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d).  \nApplicant failed to provide any information about any of the delinquent debts. \nAlthough many of them appear to be medical debts she did not provide information as \nto why they were beyond her control or that she acted responsibly toward them. She \nalso alluded to having some type of worker\u2019s compensation claim, but again failed to \nprovide any amplifying information as to when she suffered an injury and if the debts \nlisted are even related to the medical issue. Even if the medical debts were beyond her \ncontrol she still has a number of other delinquent debts that she has not addressed. I \nfind Applicant has failed to raise any of the mitigating conditions.  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  \nI have considered all of the personal conduct disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16 and \nespecially considered (a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d). Applicant alludes in her answer that she answered the \nquestions on her SCA honestly. I do not find these statements credible. Applicant has \n34 debts; some are for medical services, others for utilities and other expenses. She \nowes a tax debt of $35,000. It is inconceivable that she would be totally unaware that \nshe had any debts past due 90 days or delinquent for more than 180 days. She stated \nshe has paid the IRS $10,000. It is clear she knew she owed a substantial debt to the \nIRS. She claims she made a payment, although she failed to provide proof of it. Some \nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are several years old and others are not. I find Applicant \nintentionally and deliberately falsified information on her SCA by not listing any of her \ndelinquent debts or that she had a delinquent tax debt.  \nI have considered all of the personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17. I have especially considered (a) (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts\u201d) and (c) (\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \n\n \n6 \n \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d).  \nApplicant did not promptly report her omissions before being confronted with \nthem. Her finances are a serious security concern and the intentional concealment of \nthem creates an elevated concern. This omission is not minor and the circumstances \nwere not unique. Applicant had 34 delinquent debts, one of which was a tax lien. The \nSCA specifically asked her about her delinquent debts and she denied she had any. Her \nactions cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. I find none of \nthe mitigating conditions apply.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 57 years old. She has \nnumerous delinquent debts and failed to provide any information that she has attempted \nto pay or resolve any of them. In addition, she intentionally failed to divulge her \ndelinquent debts on her SCA. She has not presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised. Overall the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from the \nFinancial Considerations and Personal Conduct guidelines.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.ah: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He denied the other allegation (\u00b6 2.b) in the SOR\nbased on the fact that he did not deliberately falsify the information on his security\nclearance. His admissions in his answer to the SOR are incorporated in my findings of\nfact. I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 61-year-old man who was born and educated in Iraq. He graduated\nfrom a teaching institute and taught English in the public schools in Iraq from 1967 to\n1991 (Item 8; SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant was drafted into the Iraqi military and served from\n1988 until 1989 (Item 5). He and his family fled Iraq in 1991. He has lived in the United\nStates since October 1993 (Item 8). He became a naturalized U.S. Citizen in July 2000.\nHe has been employed with his current employer since October 2004 as a translator\n(linguist) (GE 1). Applicant has held an interim security clearance for almost six years.\nHe is currently working in Iraq for the U.S. Government.\nApplicant married his wife in 1982 in Iraq (Item 5). She is a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen and resides with Applicant in the U.S. They have three children, ages 25, 21 and\n19, who acquired U.S. citizenship in 2000. His father and father-in-law are deceased.\nApplicant\u2019s mother, who is 70 years old, is a homemaker. She is a citizen and a resident\nof Iraq. Applicant talks to her on the phone approximately one time a month.\nApplicant has a brother and sister-in-law who are citizens and residents of Iraq\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). His brother is a high school teach in Iraq. His sister-in-law teaches in an\nelementary school in Iraq. Applicant reports limited to no contact with his brother. His\nbrother does not have a telephone. When Applicant was in Iraq working for the U.S. in\n2003, he did see his brother on one occasion (Item 8). \n\n3\nApplicant has three sisters and two brothers-in-law who are citizens and residents\nof Iraq (SOR 1.c). Applicant had not seen these relatives from 1991 until 2003. He\nreceived permission to see them from one of the Army personnel. Also, at that time,\nthere was no policy prohibiting translators from visiting their family (AE A).\nApplicant\u2019s two sisters are homemakers in Iraq. His other sister in Iraq is not\nmarried and lives with Applicant\u2019s mother. His one brother-in-law is now retired after\nowning a liquor store. His other brother-in-law works for an Iraqi oil company. \nApplicant\u2019s other sisters live in Sweden with their husbands. They are residents\nand citizens of Sweden. He has seen some of them when they have visited the U.S. His\none-brother-in-law in Sweden retired from the Iraqi military. Applicant visited two sisters\nin Sweden in 2008.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law left Iraq in 1992 and lives in the U.S. She is 67 years\nold. She is a permanent resident alien although she is a citizen of Iraq (SOR \u00b6 1.f).\nApplicant\u2019s family knows that he is a translator for the U.S. but they do not know\nthe details of his work. His family is supportive of the efforts of the U.S. in Iraq.  None of\nhis family members have been the victims of violence or have been threatened due to\nApplicant\u2019s work for the U.S. His entire family are Christians. \nIn 2003, Applicant served as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq. He translated\ninterrogations of detainees at a prison in Iraq. Applicant admits that he was consuming\nalcohol (which was sold in the work area) in his room on one of his days off while\nemployed with the defense contractor in 2004 in Iraq. However, he reports that\nconsumption of alcohol was a common practice and that it was not prohibited by his\ncontract. He remained in his position until he was sent back to the U.S. in late July 2004\n(SOR \u00b6 2.a). He was not given any written notice of his termination as a contractor.\nApplicant did not believe he had been fired. He believed his contract at will had ended.\nHe did not ask for an explanation from the contractor. He now realizes that this was a\nmistake on his part. \nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application in April 2006, he\nanswered Section 22: Your Employment Record with a \u201cno\u201d. He did not list any adverse\ntermination from employment in 2004 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). He also completed an earlier security\nclearance application in October 2004, and he did not record any information concerning\nan adverse termination in response to Question 20. (SOR \u00b6 2.d). \nIn June 2007, Applicant spoke to an interviewer concerning his security clearance\napplication. He stated that concerning the consumption of alcohol, the regulations were\nnot in writing and were never enforced. He reported that the person who came into his\nroom unexpectedly in 2003 wanted to have him fired because Applicant had complained\nto an Army officer about his translating skills. \n\n4\nDuring that same 2007 interview, Applicant volunteered the information that when\nhe was interrogating a detainee in 2004, he was recognized. He reported his concerns to\nthe unit and asked for a change of location. He also acknowledged in the interview that\nhe was imprisoned in Iraq in 1986 because he did not support Saddam Hussein (SOR \u00b6\n1.e). He was released when he paid one of the members of the Ba\u2019ath party. He was\nreturned to his teaching position.\nApplicant acknowledged that he saw his mother and his one sister in 2007 when\nthey were in Jordan. His mother was ill and she was seeking medical treatment. When\nhis father died in 2007, Applicant did not visit his family (AE A). \nApplicant has no financial interest in Iraq. He has no desire to return to the\ncountry. Applicant  owns a home in the U.S. He has given up a teaching pension that he\nhad in Iraq. He has no contact or affiliation with any former colleagues in Iraq.\nApplicant asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship and love for his work with the Army\n(AE A). He worked in a war zone in Iraq. He worked very long hours for six days a week.\nHe has gone out on missions with the U.S. army approximately 20 times. He has lost\nfriends and co-workers on these dangerous missions. He has willingly put himself in\ndanger every day for almost six years in order to help the U.S.  \nApplicant emphasized that he would never betray the U.S. He noted that he was\nsorry that he could not come to the U.S. for a hearing because he is in Iraq and does not\nhave vacation time. He related that he could not afford to pay his expenses back to the\nU.S. at this time and could not afford to lose his pay. His 2009 affidavit, submitted in\nresponse to the FORM, emphasizes his allegiance to the U.S. He has lived in the U.S.\nfor sixteen years.\nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant breached any security policies or\nprocedures while holding a security clearance in Iraq. He has two Certificates of\nAppreciation for his work in Iraq (AE C-D).\nApplicant presented a 2008 recommendation from a Senior Research Specialist\n(Applicant\u2019s supervisor) who serves with the U.S. Army in Iraq. Applicant has worked\nclosely with his team since October 2004. Applicant has provided total commitment to\nthe mission. He is a competent and experienced professional. He is a mentor to others.\nHis loyalty to the unit has never been questioned. Applicant has been trusted with team-\ncritical responsibilities. He is an honest worker. He has always been an asset to the to\nhis team. He is recommended for a permanent security clearance (AE E).\nApplicant has several recommendations from other specialists with the U.S. Army.\nHe is lauded for his preparation and motivation. He is described as professional, reliable,\nand honest. He is mature which serves as an advantage. He works long hours at a\ntireless pace in an often thankless environment. \n\n5\nAn Army interrogator who has worked with Applicant and sees him on a daily\nbasis does not doubt his competence or dedication. He believes he is a true U.S. patriot.\nHe is the type of person that can be trusted with information. \nApplicant\u2019s current employer vouches for Applicant\u2019s professionalism and work\nethic. His skill set is second to none. He has the highest recommendation and his skills\nare greatly needed with the Joint Special Operations Task Force. \nApplicant received several Certificates of Appreciation while serving as a\ntranslator in Iraq. He is noted for his outstanding support of a unit in Operation Iraqi\nFreedom. He was praised for his expert linguistic skill and professionalism in his duties\nfrom May 2005 until July 2007 (AE E-M).   \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Iraq set forth in the Hearing\nExhibits, including the fact that in 2003, the United States led a coalition to remove\nSaddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s new government took\noffice. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains engulfed in violence,\nperpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. Numerous attacks and\nkidnappings have targeted the United States Armed Forces, contractors, and other\ncivilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against terrorists,\nthe threat of terrorism in Iraq remains. Terrorist groups can conduct intelligence activities\nas effectively as state intelligence services.\nPolicies\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . .\n. control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an\nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of\nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information\n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec.\nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as\namended and modified.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.\nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with\naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and\nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the\n\n6\npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from\nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;\nsee AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant has a mother, mother-in-law, brother, sister-in-law,\nfour sisters and brothers-in-law who are citizens of and residents of Iraq. (SOR \u00b6 1.a-c\nand 1.f). It also alleges Applicant was an employee of the Iraqi Government (SOR \u00b6 1.d)\nand that in 1986 he was imprisoned by the Iraqi Government and paid a bribe for release\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). The security concern relating to Guideline B is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\n\n7\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  A disqualifying condition\nalso may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b). Applicant\u2019s mother, brother\nand three sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant maintains weekly phone\ncontact with his mother and his sister who lives and cares for his mother. Applicant\u2019s\nbrother and sister-in-law teach in public schools in Iraq. He took an assignment in Iraq as\na translator and he acknowledged that his family knows about his work. Based on this\nevidence, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), and (b) are raised.\nSince the government produced evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of\nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the\ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United\nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information\nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it,\nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those\nof the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United\nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.\nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States,\nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317,\n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of\na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are\nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to\ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater\nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated\nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\n\n8\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well\nas each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App.\nBd. Sep. 22, 2003). Similarly, AG 8(c) \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d Applicant has monthly phone contact with his mother. This\nappears to be casual and only based on telephone communication rather than physical\ncontact with family members while he is stationed in Iraq. Applicant did not visit his family\nin Iraq when his father died in 2007. Thus, this mitigating condition has some partial\napplication in this case.\u00b6\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is\nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).\nApplicant spoke to his undivided loyalty to the U.S. Based on his relationship and loyalty\nto the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest. He has lived in the U.S. since 1993, after fleeing Iraq, and did not return to Iraq\nuntil his employment with the U.S. Army in June 2003. The majority of the members of\nhis large family, including his wife, are naturalized citizens of the U.S. or living outside of\nIraq. He has three children who are naturalized citizens. He owns property in the U.S. He\nhas worked in the U.S. for many years. He has endured dangerous conditions in Iraq on\nbehalf of the U.S. Army. There is no evidence that he has connections or contact with\nany people other than his sister and mother in Iraq. He has established application of AG\n8(b). \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately provided false or misleading information\non his 2006 and 2004 security clearance applications, when he did not list a 2004\ntermination from employment due to alcohol consumption. (SOR \u00b6 2.a). It also alleges\nconsumption of alcohol in violation of policy in Iraq (SOR \u00b6 2.b). The security concern\nrelating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process.\nAG 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:\n\n9\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and\n(C) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgement,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulation, or other characteristics indicating that the person may\nnot properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not\nlimited to information concerning relevant facts to an employer,\ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official\ngovernment representative.\nApplicant incorrectly answered employment questions concerning whether he had\nbeen terminated under adverse circumstances on two security clearance applications.\nHe denied that he intentionally falsified his answers or attempted to deceive the\ngovernment.\nWhen a falsification is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\nApplicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must\nconsiders the record evidence as a whole to determine where there is direct or\ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind a the time of the\nomission occurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov, 17, 2004) (explaining\nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\nApplicant never believed he violated the contractor\u2019s policy, so he denied the\nallegations in the SOR. He knew that consumption of alcohol was common practice and\nwas easily available and that it was not prohibited by the contract. Any policy was not in\nwriting. When he was initially told that he was fired by the person who came into his\nroom, he continued to work. He was not given any written notice of his termination as a\ncontractor.  The contract was at will and thus he could be terminated at any time for any\nreason with or without explanation. Applicant did not think of himself as fired. Only when\nit was discussed with the investigator in 2007, did he realize he should have asked for an\nexplanation from the contractor so that he could accurately complete the SF 86. Thus,\nhis failure to disclose that he had been terminated was not intentionally false. It was\nbased on a misunderstanding of what happened.\nApplicant admitted that he omitted information. However, he also provided\nevidence that he thoroughly discussed and disclosed the information, allegedly omitted,\nin the 2007 interview. I do not find his omissions rising to a level of intentional\nwrongdoing in an effort to deceive the Government. Nor do I find that such omissions\n\n10\nraise questions about his reliability or ability to protect classified information. Based on\nthe documentary evidence in this record, and Applicant\u2019s affidavit submitted in response\nto the FORM, his explanations are reasonable. His state of mind at the time he\ncompleted his security clearance application does not establish deliberate falsification.\nWhen he provided erroneous information, it was based on the mistaken belief that he\nwas not fired and not an intentional, deliberate lie. Under AG \u00b6 17 falsification is not\nsubstantiated.\nConcerning the use of alcohol in 2004 and the admission of use of alcohol once or\ntwice during his 2007 interview, Applicant has mitigated any security concern.\nBased on the above discussion, he consumed alcohol in his room on a day off in\n2004 which was against the contract. It has been mitigated by time and behavior.\nParagraph 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. In pertinent\npart, AG \u00b6 17 provides:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability.\nI have considered these mitigating conditions and  find them applicable. The other\nmitigating conditions are not relevant in this case:\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n11\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an\napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family ties to the\nU.S. relative to his or her ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.;\nand ,many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7\n(App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Four circumstances weigh against\nApplicant in the whole person analysis. First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and\nvarious human rights abuses in Iraq. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists\nare hostile to the U.S. and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and even\nfriendly governments, could attempt to use Applicant\u2019s sisters, brother and brothers-in-\nlaw and mother to obtain such information. Second, he had numerous connections to\nIraq before he immigrated to the U.S. in 1993. Following his birth, he spent his formative\nyears there, along with his large family. He was educated in Iraq and subsequently\nconscripted into Iraq\u2019s army. Third, his sister, brother and mother remain citizens of Iraq.\nFourth, he has some contact with his mother and sibling. \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security\nclearance. He is a mature person, who has lived in the U.S. since 1993, and has been a\nnaturalized citizen for many years. His spouse is a naturalized citizen and resides with\nhim, as do his three children. He obviously has a strong sense of patriotism toward the\nU.S., as witnessed by his dedication and work with the U.S. Army. There is no evidence\nthat he has ever taken any action that could cause potential harm to the U.S. His military\nsupervisors, who work with him daily in a war zone, praised his work in the cause of\nfreedom in Iraq. After fleeing Iraq in 1991, he never returned until he worked with the\nU.S. Army and his contractor in 2003. He has established his life in the U.S.\nApplicant held a security clearance during his tenure with the U.S. Army without\nindication that he breached security policies or procedures. He served the U.S. in a\ndangerous, high-risk situation and his character references establish his significant\ncontributions to U.S. national security. While that fact is not normally to be considered a\nfactor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board noted in ISCR Case. No. 05-03846 at 6\n(App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006) as follows:\nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior\nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant probative value\nfor purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the security concerns raised by\napplicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances.

However,\n\nI conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security clearance.\n2\nAssuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions articulated under\nAG 8 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person analysis standing\nalone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case.\n12\nthe Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in Guideline B cases, where\nthe applicant has established by credible, independent evidence that his compliance with\nsecurity procedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk\ncircumstances in which the applicant made a significant contribution to the nation\u2019s\nsecurity. See. e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006). The presence\nof such circumstances can give credibility to an applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be\nrelied upon to recognize, resist, and report to a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or\nexploitation.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and\ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence and personal conduct.  Overall, the\n2\nrecord evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated\nthe security concerns arising from his foreign influence and personal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set\nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct\nFOR Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He stated, \u201cI will not violate the U.S. laws or Constitution.\u201d  Id. at 4.  Although he does\nnot intend to move to Germany, he could do so if necessitated by employment concerns.   \nApplicant\u2019s father is a dual citizen of Germany and Iran.  A retired physician, Applicant\u2019s\nfather visits Iran approximately once a year.  Applicant\u2019s mother is deceased.  Applicant traveled to\nGermany on his U.S. passport to attend her funeral.  \n\n3\nApplicant has three uncles who are citizens of Iran.  One lives in the U.S. and is \u201cprobably\nstill an Iranian citizen.\u201d  Id. at 5.

It has sought illegally to obtain U.S. military and sensitive\ntechnology.  \nGermany is an ally of the U.S. and its second largest trading partner.  Nearly a quarter of U.S.\ncitizens have some German ancestry.\nDiscussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.10(a)(1).\n1\nDirective \u00b6 E2.10(a)(3).\n2\nDirective \u00b6 E2.7(a).\n3\nDirective \u00b6 E2.7(b).  \n4\nDirective \u00b6 E2.7(e).  \n5\n4\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge concluded that the evidence raised two\nForeign Preference disqualifying conditions (FPDC)\u201310(a)(1),  possession of a foreign passport, and\n1\n10(a)(3),  accepting medical or other benefits from a foreign country.  As the Judge\u2019s findings\n2\ndemonstrate, Applicant\u2019s receipt of medical treatment in Germany, and his German passport and \ndriver\u2019s license establish these disqualifying conditions.  The Judge also concluded that the case\nraised two Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions (FIDC)\u20137(a),  contact with, inter alia, a\n3\nforeign family member, etc, which creates a risk of exploitation, and 7(b),  connections to, inter alia,\n4\na foreign person that creates a potential conflict of interest.  Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives, both in\nGermany and in Iran, establish these conditions.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred, however, in not concluding that the\nevidence also raised FIDC 7(e),  a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign\n5\ncountry, which might subject the applicant to foreign coercion.  Department Counsel points to\nApplicant\u2019s share in the German real property, valued at over 700,000 Euros, and his German bank\naccount, valued at around 6,000 Euros.  Department Counsel notes that, when viewed in comparison\nwith Applicant\u2019s financial interests in the U.S., Applicant\u2019s German holdings constitute the\nsubstantial majority of his net worth. Under these circumstances, the record establishes a substantial\nproperty interest in Germany.  Given record evidence of Applicant\u2019s ties to that country, it is\nforeseeable that this interest could be a means through which Applicant could be subjected to foreign\ninfluence.  See ISCR Case No. 07-06364 at 2 (App. Bd. May 28, 2008)(\u201cApplicant\u2019s Egyptian\nholdings, which include a condominium valued at $170,000 and a bank account worth $100,000,\nmust be considered substantial and could subject Applicant to heightened risk of foreign influence\nor exploitation[.]\u201d)  See also ISCR Case No. 08-04488 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 23, 2009)(In a Guideline\n\n5\nB case the Government is not required to prove affirmatively that a country specifically targets U.S.\ncitizens in order to gather protected information.  The \u201cheightened risk\u201d language in the Guideline\naddresses an applicant\u2019s contacts, not necessarily the country in which the contact is located).  Under\nthe facts of this case, Applicants\u2019 circumstances are sufficient to establish FCDC 7(e).  The Judge\u2019s\nfailure to discuss this disqualifying condition is error.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis of Applicant\u2019 father\u2019s visits to Iran is\nerroneous.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  The concern regarding the father\u2019s visits to\nIran grows out of Applicant\u2019s ties to his father.  The Judge\u2019s favorable resolution of the issue relies\non mis-stating the concern as to Applicant\u2019s ties to Iran.  The security vulnerability is correctly\nalluded to by the Judge (\u201cIranian authorities could use Applicant\u2019s father to coerce Applicant.\u201d\nDecision at 15-16).  However, he then resolves the issue by comparing Applicant\u2019s ties to the U.S.\nto his ties to Iran, which is not the correct analysis of this issue.  \n Concerning mitigation, the Board notes that the Judge did not attempt to clear Applicant\nthrough the mitigating conditions in and of themselves.  Rather, he did so by means of his whole-\nperson analysis.  This analysis balanced Applicant\u2019s ties to his German family members with his ties\nto the U.S. and with his excellent reputation in this country.  Missing from the whole-person\nanalysis, however, is any discussion in Applicant\u2019s property interests in Germany, due to the Judge\nhaving failed to discover in those interests substantial evidence of FCMC 7(e).  Department Counsel\nargues that the record evidence will not sustain a conclusion that Applicant has mitigated security\nconcerns arising from this foreign property.\nThe Board notes Applicant\u2019s stated intention to close out the German bank account.\nHowever, he had not closed it out as of the close of the record.  Applicant also stated that he and his\nco-owner intended to sell the real property.  Despite the Judge\u2019s having provided Applicant with\nseveral weeks post-hearing in which to demonstrate divestiture, Applicant provided only one\ndocument, the letter from the German attorney quoted in the Judge\u2019s findings, confirming a \u201ccontract\nof mandate\u201d and advising that \u201ca proposal for further proceedings\u201d is forthcoming.  Neither the\nrecord, nor Applicant\u2019s reply brief, further elaborate on this issue, either by explaining what a\ncontract of mandate is or by discussing what further proceedings are required or contemplated.  As\nDepartment Counsel states, \u201c[w]hile Applicant may have asserted that he intends to divest himself\nof his rental property and his foreign bank account, there is no record evidence that he actually did\nso or that he even made any attempts to do so.\u201d   Department Counsel Brief at 23.  The evidence\nsupports this statement, because, at the close of the record, Applicant still owned the properties under\nconsideration.  The record contains a paucity of evidence to demonstrate mitigation of the security\nconcern arising out of Applicant\u2019s foreign property interests.  Viewing the record as a whole and in\nlight of the Egan standard, and specifically taking into account record evidence of Applicant\u2019s ties\n\n\u201c[Applicant] views his citizenship as a contract with that country.  When [Applicant] was asked if he was\n6\nwilling to relinquish his German citizenship, he claimed that was like asking a father to give up a child, he could not do\nit.\u201d  Summary of Personal Subject Interview (SPIN) conducted in December 2007.  At the hearing, he reiterated his\nintention to retain his German citizenship.  Tr. at 34.  Applicant also stated that he was bound by the laws of Germany\nand viewed his dual \u201ccitizenships as an opportunity . . . to live, work and travel in most of North America and Europe.\u201d\nSPIN, supra.  As stated in the Judge\u2019s findings, Applicant foresees a possibility that economic circumstances may require\nhim to move back to Germany.  \n6\nto Germany  and the problems inherent in Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s ties and visits to Iran, the Board\n6\ncannot conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision under Guideline B is sustainable.\n \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Edmunds, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant was born in the United States. Applicant, his father, brother, and two \nuncles have connections to Iran, Germany, or both countries. However, Applicant has \nnot been to Iran, or communicated with anyone living in Iran for more than 15 years. \nApplicant has more significant connections to Germany. Applicant terminated his \naccess to his German passport. He has significantly greater contacts with the United \nStates than with Germany. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of U.S. interests. Foreign preference and foreign influence security concerns are \nmitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 3, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (e-\nQIP version) (hereinafter SF-86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On December 8, 2008, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to him, alleging security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and \nB (Foreign Influence) (GE 7). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nSeptember 16, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                             \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \n \nOn January 12, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge (GE 8). On February 10, 2009, Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed. On February 11, 2009, the case was assigned to an administrative \njudge. On March 10, 2009, the case was transferred to another administrative judge. On \nMarch 16, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice setting the hearing for April 21, 2009 \n(GE 6). Applicant requested a delay in his hearing, and the delay was approved. The \ncase was then transferred to me on April 16, 2009. On April 17, 2009, DOHA issued a \nhearing notice setting the hearing for May 21, 2009 (GE 4). The hearing was held on \nMay 21, 2009, as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits \n(GE 1-3) (Transcript (Tr.) 17-18), and Applicant offered 12 exhibits (Tr. 18-19; AE A-L). \nThere were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-3 (Tr. 18), and AE A-L (Tr. 19). \nAdditionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and the hearing notices (GE 4-\n8). On May 29, 2009, I received the hearing transcript. I granted several post-hearing \ndelays to give Applicant time to divest himself of his property in Germany (Hearing \nExhibit I). On June 10, 2009, Applicant submitted a letter from an attorney about \ntransfer of his property in Germany (AE M). Department Counsel did not object to the \nadmission of this document, and I admitted it into evidence. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of facts concerning the \nIslamic Republic of Iran (hereinafter Iran) (Tr. 10-11). Department Counsel provided \nsupporting documents to show detail and context for these facts in the Administrative \nNotice request. Applicant and Department Counsel did not object to me taking \nadministrative notice of all of the facts in all of the documents (Tr. 10-11). See the Iran \nsection of the Findings of Fact of this decision, infra, for the material facts from \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s submissions on Iran. During the hearing, it became apparent that \nApplicant has significantly stronger connections to Germany than to Iran. I advised the \nparties that I would be taking administrative notice of materials from the Department of \nState website pertaining to Germany (Tr. 65). There was no objection to my proposal \n(Tr. 65).

See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v.

His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old senior research scientist (Tr. 21-22). Applicant does \nnot currently possess a security clearance; however, he needs a clearance to enhance \nhis employment (Tr. 21). Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics and \ncomputer science, and a master\u2019s degree in computer science in the United States (Tr. \n22). He registered for the U.S. selective service system (Tr. 24). His professional goal is \nto improve the cyber defenses of the United States (Tr. 28). \n \nApplicant was born in the United States. When he was about six months old, \nApplicant and his family moved to Germany (Tr. 22-23, 36). After completing high \nschool in Germany, Applicant moved back to the United States when he was 17 (Tr. 23, \n36). When he was in high school and during the summers when he was in college, he \nworked in Germany (Tr. 37). Applicant has never married and does not have any \nchildren (Tr. 33, 35). He has not served in the U.S. or German military (Tr. 24, 35).  \n \nApplicant has one brother and no sisters (Tr. 22). His brother is a dual citizen of \nthe United States and Germany, who currently resides in Germany (Tr. 23).  \n \nForeign preference and Germany \n \n \nAlthough Applicant was born in the United States, he received his German \ncitizenship through his mother, who was a German citizen (Tr. 34). Applicant has held a \nGerman passport since he reached the age of 18 (Tr. 39). Applicant reapplied for a \nGerman passport, which was issued in July 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Tr. 38). Applicant most \nrecently used his German passport to enter Germany and the European Union in \nAugust 2005 and in 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Tr. 40). On November 6, 2008, Applicant \nsurrendered his German passport to his facility security officer (Tr. 26, 37-38; AE A). \n \nApplicant admitted in his SOR response that he used his German citizenship to \nprotect his financial interests in rental and interest income from 1996 to 2008 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c; GE 8). He could not give any examples of how his German citizenship made any \ndifference in his financial interests (Tr. 47). He explained that his SOR response was his \nagreement with DOHA\u2019s interpretation of the information he provided. As an example of \nbenefits received from the German government, in 2000, Applicant had his wisdom \nteeth removed in Germany (Tr. 45). His father paid for the portion not paid by the \nGerman government (Tr. 46). He has never voted in a German election (Tr. 46). He is \n \n1The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses or locations \nin order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information. \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                             \nnot registered to vote in Germany (Tr. 46). He does not have any retirement accounts in \nGermany (Tr. 46). Although he has a German driver\u2019s license, he does not have a \nGerman residency registration (Tr. 50).  \n \n \nOn December 13, 2007, Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) investigator that he was not willing to renounce his German citizenship (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d). Applicant is a German citizen and he intends to remain a German citizen (Tr. 34). \nOn July 22, 2008, Applicant responded to a DOHA interrogatory and said that he had a \nduty and obligation to follow Germany\u2019s law and fulfill the responsibilities of a German \ncitizen (SOR \u00b6 1.e).  \n \nOn November 12, 2008, Applicant responded to a DOHA interrogatory and \nstated that if a military conflict arose between Germany and the United States, he had \n\u201cno automatic\u201d answer about which side he would choose (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He also said he \nis bound by the laws of the United States and the laws of Germany, and he intended to \nkeep his obligations to both countries (SOR \u00b6 1.g). When his counsel asked him about \nhis allegiance to the United States or Germany, Applicant said, \u201cI will not violate the \nU.S. laws or Constitution\u201d (Tr. 25).  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant explained that if there was a conflict between the United \nStates and Germany he would side with the United States (Tr. 48). He did not want to \nserve in the German military (Tr. 25). He does not intend to move to Germany (Tr. 48). \nHowever, if he was unemployed in the United States, he would consider moving to \nGermany for employment (Tr. 49). Applicant has a stronger relationship to the United \nStates than to Germany because he has lived his adult life in the United States (Tr. 49). \nThe United States has provided his post-secondary education (Tr. 49). He pays taxes to \nthe United States (Tr. 49). He has an uncle and some cousins who live in the United \nStates (Tr. 50).  \n \nForeign Influence of Iran and Germany \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is a dual citizen of Iran and Germany, who resides in Germany. \nHis father is a 78-year-old retiree (Tr. 56). Applicant contacts his father about once a \nweek by telephone and by email about once a month (SOR \u00b6 2.a). His father has family \nmembers living in Iran (SOR \u00b6 2.b). His father practiced medicine in Germany for many \nyears and is now a retired physician (Tr. 29, 51). He retired in the early 1990s (Tr. 30). \nApplicant\u2019s father visits Iran about once each year (Tr. 56).  Applicant does not speak \nPersian and his communication with his Iranian relatives is very limited (Tr. 59).  \nApplicant went to Iran twice when he was 14 or 15, and then did not return (Tr. 63). He \ndoes not intend to travel to Iran in the future (Tr. 63). The last time that he talked to a \nrelative living in Iran was when he visited Iran (Tr. 64).    \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Germany, who resides in Germany (SOR \u00b6 2.c). \nHe contacted his mother about once a week by telephone and by email about once a \nmonth (SOR \u00b6 2.c). His mother passed away shortly before his hearing, and he traveled \nto Germany for her funeral in June 2009 (Tr. 26). He used his U.S. passport to secure \nhis planned trip to Germany for her funeral (Tr. 26).  \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                             \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a dual citizen of Germany and the United States, who \nresides in Germany (SOR \u00b6 2.d; Tr. 53). His brother lived in the United States for two \nyears in the early 1990s and then returned to Germany (Tr. 53). He is in contact with his \nbrother by telephone about once a month (SOR \u00b6 2.d). His brother was drafted into and \nserved in the German military for the required time period (Tr. 53). His brother works for \na private company in Germany (Tr. 53). His brother is not married (Tr. 54). \n \nApplicant\u2019s uncle (A), who lives in the United States, was a professor at an \nIranian University during the 1980s. Uncle A has traveled back to Iran as recently as \n2008 (SOR \u00b6 2.e). Uncle A has lived in the United States since the 1990s (Tr. 57). \nUncle A is probably still an Iranian citizen (Tr. 58). Applicant did not think uncle A was \nreceiving a pension from the Iranian government (Tr. 58).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s uncle (M) was a city civil servant in Iran (SOR \u00b6 2.f; Tr. 54). He is \ncurrently retired (Tr. 55). Applicant has not had any contact with uncle M for many years \n(Tr. 56). Applicant\u2019s father probably had contact with uncle M; however, Applicant did \nnot know the extent of the contact (Tr. 56).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s uncle (H) lives in France and retains his Iranian citizenship (Tr. 59).  \nApplicant met uncle H when he visited France several years ago (Tr. 59).   \n \nApplicant co-owned a house and rental property located in Germany with his \nbrother (SOR \u00b6 2.g). On December 31, 2008, the German house was sold (Tr. 30). \nApplicant\u2019s share of the sales proceeds was about 20,000 Euros (Tr. 40). He deposited \nthe 20,000 Euros in his U.S. bank account (Tr. 41).  \n \nApplicant has a half interest in another German property with an appraised value \nof approximately 700,000 Euros (SOR \u00b6 2.g; Tr. 41-42). His brother is a co-owner (Tr. \n41-42). This property is a two-family unit, and his father lives in part of the dwelling (Tr. \n41). Applicant\u2019s father used part of the unit several years ago as commercial office \nspace (Tr. 44). There is a mortgage of 20,000 Euros on the property (Tr. 46). The rent \nhas varied from about 300 Euros to about 3,000 Euros per month (Tr. 43). Applicant \nstopped receiving any rental income from the property in November or December of \n2008 (Tr. 42). They are trying to sell the property for about 600,000 Euros (Tr. 43). He \ndoes not own any other properties in Germany (Tr. 34, 47). On June 10, 2009, Applicant \nprovided a letter from his German attorney indicating confirmation of a \u201ccontract of \nmandate regarding the sale of [his] real estate .  .  .  After consultation with the tax \nconsultant, [his attorney] will submit a proposal for further proceedings\u201d (AE M).  \n \nApplicant has a bank account in Germany valued at about 6,000 Euros (SOR \u00b6 \n2.h; Tr. 44). At the hearing, Applicant said he intended to close the account (Tr. 30).  \n \nApplicant traveled to Germany in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 \nto visit family members and friends (SOR \u00b6 2.i). Applicant has three friends in Germany, \nand he visits them when he goes to Germany (Tr. 59, 60). He does not regularly \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                             \nes.       \n                                           \ncommunicate with one of his friends (Tr. 60). He sends an email or calls the other two \nfriends about once a month (Tr. 61-62). \n \n Applicant does not have a criminal record (Tr. 33). He owns his home in the \nUnited States, which is valued at about $87,000 (Tr. 35). His home does not have a \nmortgage (Tr. 35). He has about $30,000 in his U.S. savings and checking accounts (Tr. \n35). He has about $10,000 in his U.S. IRA and about $25,000 in his U.S. 401(K) plan \n(Tr. 35). \n \nReferences \n \nApplicant provided several good performance evaluations from his employers \n(Tr. 26; AE B-D). He received a marketing award from his employer (Tr. 28; AE H). He \ncompleted 22 hours of community emergency response training to assist him as a \nvolunteer with the community emergency response team (Tr. 27; AE F, G, I).  \n \nAppellant provided a letter from another friend, who has known him for six \nyears.2 She has lived with Applicant and traveled to Germany with Applicant. She \ndescribed him as honest, caring, and helpful. Applicant is civic-minded and patriotic. He \nactively participated at caucus meetings and other U.S. election activiti\n \n \nApplicant\u2019s friend and colleague of many years described him as a \u201crole model of \nexcellence and integrity\u201d (AE E). He has made an influential, positive impact on his \nfriend\u2019s life (AE E). \n \nAnother of Applicant\u2019s friends and colleagues, who has known him since 2007, \ndescribed him as a \u201cgifted individual with a strong sense of duty and responsibility to the \norganization he works for\u201d and the U.S. government (AE K). He indicated Applicant is \nloyal, honest, thoughtful, and generous with a \u201ctrue desire to improve the country he \nlives in\u201d (AE J). Applicant\u2019s talent, character, and qualifications make him a valuable \nasset to the United States. \n   \nIran3 \n \nIran is a constitutional, theocratic Islamic republic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy \ndominate the key power structures and ultimate political authority is vested in a learned \nreligious scholar. Iran engages in clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and \nother weapons of mass destruction (WMD), sponsors international terrorism, intervenes \nin the internal affairs of Iraq, undermines the Middle East peace process, and violates \nthe human rights of the Iranian people. The United States and its allies are attempting to \nblock Iran\u2019s goals of obtaining nuclear weapons and other WMD and to counter Iran\u2019s \nefforts to destabilize Iraq and other Middle East countries.  Iran has sought to illegally \nobtain U.S. military equipment and other sensitive technology.  \n \n2 A May 19, 2009, letter from his friend provides the source for the facts in this paragraph. \n \n3The facts in the section concerning Iran are from the Department Counsel\u2019s documents \nsubmitted for Administrative Notice.  \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \n \nIran is one of the most active state sponsors of terrorism. The United States is \nconcerned about the possibility that terrorists could eventually obtain WMD from Iran. \nIran supports terrorists who attack Israel and have encouraged, facilitated and engaged \nin sectarian violence in Iraq. \n \nIranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens, should carefully consider the risks of \ntravel in Iran because they are still considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities. \nIran does not recognize dual citizenship. The Iranian government has harassed and \ndetained dual citizens of the United States and Iran.       \n \nThe Iranian government has a poor human rights record. The Iranian government \nsponsors torture, stoning, amputation and other severe punishments of Iranian citizens. \nCivil liberties in Iran are severely restricted.  \n  \nGermany4 \n \nThe relationship between Germany and the United States has been close since \nthe end of World War II. Germany is a key partner in U.S. relations with Europeans in \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union. \n \nMore than 7 million Germans have immigrated over the last three centuries, and \ntoday nearly a quarter of U.S. citizens claim German ancestry. U.S. policy toward \nGermany is to preserve a close and vital relationship with Germany, not only as friends \nand trading partners, but also as allies. During the 45 years in which Germany was \ndivided, the large American military presence in West Germany showed the U.S. \ncommitment to preserving peace and security in Europe.  \n \nAs NATO allies, the United States and Germany work closely together to \nmaintain peace and freedom, especially in Europe with recent emphasis on peace \nkeeping in the Balkans. Germany is an important contributor to our common effort in \nAfghanistan, providing about 3,500 military personnel to the NATO ISAF mission, \nmaking it the third-largest troop contributor after the United States and the United \nKingdom.  \n \nGermany is a U.S. ally in the campaign against terrorism. The United States and \nGermany share a common commitment to an open and expanding world economy. \nPersonal ties between the United States and Germany extend beyond immigration to \ninclude extensive foreign exchange programs, vast tourism in both directions, and the \npresence in Germany of large numbers of American military personnel and their \ndependents. \n \nThe United States is Germany\u2019s second-largest trading partner. Two-way trade in \ngoods totaled $152 billion in 2008. Major U.S. export categories include aircraft, \n \n4 The facts in this section concerning Germany are from the U.S. State Department website, \n\u201cBackground Note: Germany,\u201d (June 2009).

The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                             \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence) are the \nrelevant security concerns with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nForeign Preference \n \nAG \u00b6 9 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about foreign preference, stating, \n\u201cwhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country \nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d Conditions under AG \u00b6 \n10 that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case include: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests \nin another country; \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and  \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                             \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen by virtue of his birth in the United States. His \nparents took him to Germany when he was about six months old, where he was raised, \nreceived educational and medical benefits, and exercised other attributes of German \ncitizenship. He returned to the United States when he was 17 years old; however, he \nobtained and used a German passport after returning to the United States. Disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and 10(a)(3) apply. Although he admitted in his SOR \nresponse that he used his German \u201ccitizenship to protect [his German] financial or \nbusiness interests,\u201d at his hearing he said he was agreeing with DOHA\u2019s interpretation \nin the SOR of his conduct. There was no record evidence of a specific advantage he \nreceived in his business or financial relationships due to his German citizenship. AG \u00b6 \n10(a)(5) is not established. Applicant made several statements in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories that showed he had not fully abandoned his relationship with Germany. \nHe said he would obey the laws of Germany; he was not willing to renounce his German \ncitizenship; and he wanted to retain his German citizenship. He said he would comply \nwith the requirements of German citizenship. These statements show a sufficient loyalty \nor bond to Germany to establish AG \u00b6 10(d).  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 11, conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n  \nApplicant\u2019s exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of German citizenship \noccurred when Applicant was a minor, except for his possession and use of his German \npassport to enter Germany. On November 6, 2008, Applicant surrendered his German \npassport to his facility security officer. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(c) and 11(e) apply. The applicability of \nthese two mitigating conditions cannot be applied to fully mitigate Guideline C concerns \nbecause his statements responding to interrogatories showing some loyalty and bond to \nGermany are more problematic.5 Such concerns are mitigated under the Whole Person \nConcept, infra. \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.  \n \nApplicant was born in the United States and moved to Germany when he was six \nmonths old. He spent the next 17 years in Germany. He attended German primary and \nsecondary schools. He received medical, educational, and other benefits from the \nGerman government. After returning to the United States, he used a German passport \n \n5 See ISCR Case No. 08-05869 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 24, 2009) (deciding that these two mitigating \nconditions were insufficient to mitigate \u201cprofound consequences of a voluntary decision by a U.S. citizen \nto serve in [Australia\u2019s] military\u201d under Guideline C).   \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nto enter Germany almost every year for the last nine years. His father and brother are \ncitizens of Germany. His brother is also a citizen of the United States. Applicant \ncommunicates frequently with his father, brother, and two German friends. Additionally, \nhis father goes to Iran annually and communicates frequently with his family in Iran. \nApplicant\u2019s father and uncles are Iranian citizens. One of Applicant\u2019s uncles and some \ncousins live in Iran.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person living in a foreign country \nor who is a citizen of a foreign country, is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under \nGuideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country, and an Applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for \nforeign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Iran with the United States, places a significant, but not insurmountable \nburden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his and his father\u2019s relationship \nwith family members who are citizens of Iran or living in Iran do not pose a security risk. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s relationships with his father, brother, and two German friends \nliving in Germany, and his statements about his German citizenship raise security \nconcerns, although to a much lesser degree because of Germany\u2019s close relationship \nwith the United States, adherence to the rule of law, and democratic government.  \n \nApplicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to protect his family members \nliving in Iran from harm, pressure, enticement, or coercion.6 With Iran\u2019s negative human \nrights record, support for terrorism, and the high levels of crime in Iran as well as other \npolitical, economic and military problems in the country, it is conceivable that anyone \nliving in Iran might be targeted by governmental or non-governmental criminal elements \nin an attempt to gather information from the United States. \n \nIran has sought to illegally obtain U.S. military equipment and other sensitive \ntechnology from the United States. Applicant\u2019s connections to his family living in Iran \n \n6 An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a much heavier burden to overcome than an \napplicant with relatives living in Germany. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) \n(stating an applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when \nparents and siblings live in Iran). See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) \n(articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when an applicant has family members living in Iran); ISCR \nCase No. 07-12471 at 9 (A.J. May 30, 2008) (listing numerous recent cases involving U.S. citizens with \nIranian connections whose clearances were denied, and citing no recent cases where the Appeal Board \naffirmed the grant of a clearance for someone with immediate family members living in Iran). \n \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                             \nraise a sufficient concern to require careful scrutiny. An evaluation is necessary about \nany possible desire for him to assist relatives living in Iran by providing sensitive or \nclassified information.    \n \nDepartment Counsel produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s contacts with \nhis relatives who are citizens of Iran or Germany or live in Iran or Germany to raise the \nissue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply \nand further inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) partially applies; however, AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(c), 8(d), and 8(e) do not apply \nbecause the U.S. government has not encouraged his involvement with Iranian or \nGerman citizens, his travel to Germany, or other German connections. Applicant has \nfrequent contact with his father, brother, and two friends. His father has frequent contact \nwith his brother, who lives in Iran. Additionally, Applicant has gone to Germany almost \nevery year for the last nine years. His contacts with family members and friends living \noutside the United States are sufficiently frequent to raise the possibility of his being \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                             \nforced to choose between the United States and the welfare of his relatives or friends, \nwho are citizens of Germany or Iran and/or living in Germany or Iran. Applicant is not \nable to fully meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships \nwith his relatives who are Iranian citizens] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. There is no evidence that his relatives, who are German \nor Iranian citizens and/or are living in Germany or Iran are or have been political \nactivist(s), challenging the policies of the German or Iranian governments. There is no \nevidence that terrorists, criminals, or the German or Iranian governments have \napproached or threatened Applicant or his relatives living outside the United States for \nclassified or sensitive information. As such, there is a reduced possibility that his \nrelatives living overseas or Applicant himself would be targets for coercion or \nexploitation. While the government does not have a burden to prove the presence of \nsuch evidence, if such record evidence were present, Applicant would have a very \nheavy evidentiary burden to overcome to mitigate foreign influence security concerns.   \n \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He established that \u201che can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant is a native-born, \nU.S. citizen. He received his post-secondary education in the United States. Applicant \nresides in the United States, and would not move to Germany unless he could not find \nemployment in the United States and could find employment in Germany. One of his \nuncles lives in the United States. His brother, who lives in Germany, is a U.S.-born \ncitizen. He has bank accounts, a 401(K) account, and a home in the United States, and \nhe is divesting himself of financial interests in Germany. His employment is in the United \nStates. He has participated in the U.S. political process. He is a volunteer in U.S. \nemergency medicine.   \n  \nAG \u00b6 8(f) partially applies because Applicant is divesting himself of financial \ninterests in Germany. This mitigating condition can only mitigate AG \u00b6 7(e), which \nprovides, \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in \nany foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to Germany or Iran are less significant than his \nconnections to the United States. His connections to the United States taken together \nare sufficient to fully overcome the foreign influence security concerns.  Any residual \nforeign influence security concerns are mitigated under the Whole Person Concept, \ninfra. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines C and B in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nA Guideline B and C decision concerning Iran or Germany must take into \nconsideration the geopolitical situations in those two countries, as well as the dangers \nexisting in them.7 Iran has sought to illegally obtain U.S. military equipment and other \nsensitive technology. It has very serious economic, military, political, judicial/legal and \nsocial problems. Iran sponsors terrorism and is hostile to the United States. If Iran could \nobtain important classified information through threatening Applicant\u2019s relatives living in \nor visiting Iran, it is a reasonable possibility that Iranian authorities would take those \nactions.       \n \nThe United States\u2019 relationship with Germany is completely different from its \nrelationship with Iran. The United States and Germany are closely related. From the end \nof World War II in 1945 to the present time, Germany has been one of the United \nStates\u2019 closest military and diplomatic allies. Through most of those years the United \nStates and West Germany confronted the Soviet Union and its satellite countries in \nCentral Europe. The relationship between the United States and Germany was \nespecially close in the area of national security. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. military \npersonnel have served in Germany (some for many years), and many have German-\nborn spouses and children. Numerous German personnel have trained in the United \nStates. Currently, German and U.S. military personnel serve together under combat \nconditions in Afghanistan. This very close relationship is one of mutual trust, where \nhighly classified information is routinely shared between Germany and the United \nStates. It is extraordinarily unlikely that Germany would use Applicant\u2019s relatives living in \nGermany to attempt to obtain classified information from Applicant.      \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his two uncles and cousins living in Iran are too \nremote to cause security concerns. Applicant last visited Iran when he was 15 years old, \nabout 18 years ago. He has not communicated with his family in Iran since he was 15 \nyears old. If there is any concern about Iran, it is because Applicant\u2019s 78-year-old father \ntravels to Iran on an annual basis. Theoretically, during one of those visits, Iranian \n \n7 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion). \n  \n\n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                             \nauthorities could use Applicant\u2019s father to coerce Applicant. Applicant could be placed in \na position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the United States, especially because \nthe Iranian government engages in lawless activities (sponsors terrorism, etc.). Because \nIran behaves in a lawless manner, the probability is increased that Iran may attempt to \nharm or pressure Applicant\u2019s relatives to gain some kind of advantage over Applicant.  \nNevertheless, Applicant\u2019s relationship with the United States is so much stronger than \nhis relationship with Iran, I am confident he would inform security authorities of any \nIranian attempt to obtain classified information from him.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with Germany is much more significant than his \nrelationship with Iran. Applicant traveled to Germany on an annual basis for the last nine \nyears. He had a German passport until 2008, which he used to travel to Germany until \nrecently. He frequently communicates with his father, brother, and two friends, who live \nin Germany. Applicant is a German citizen because his mother was a German citizen. \nHe has a German driver\u2019s license; however, he does not have a German residency \nregistration.  \n \nApplicant is not willing to renounce his German citizenship. He intends to remain \na German citizen. He said that he had a duty and obligation to follow Germany\u2019s laws \nand fulfill the responsibilities of a German citizen. If a military conflict arose between \nGermany and the United States, Applicant had \u201cno automatic\u201d answer about which side \nhe would choose. He also said he is bound by the laws of the United States and the \nlaws of Germany, and he intended to keep his obligations to both countries. When his \ncounsel asked him about his allegiance to the United States or Germany, Applicant \nsaid, \u201cI will not violate the U.S. laws or Constitution.\u201d  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant explained that if there was a conflict between the United \nStates and Germany he would side with the United States. He did not want to serve in \nthe Germany military. He does not intend to move to Germany. However, if he was \nunemployed in the United States, he would consider moving to Germany for \nemployment. Applicant has a stronger relationship with the United States than to \nGermany because he has chosen to live, and has lived, his adult life in the United \nStates. The United States has provided his post-secondary education. He pays taxes to \nthe United States. He has an uncle and some cousins who live in the United States.  I \nfind his statements about his preference for the United States over Germany to be \ncredible. \n \nHis communications establish ties of affection to his German family members. \nHowever, it is extraordinarily unlikely that Germany would use Applicant\u2019s family living in \nGermany to induce or coerce him into providing classified information.  \n \nThe circumstances militating towards approval of a clearance are more \nsignificant. Applicant was born in the United States. He left Germany 18 years ago, just \nafter graduating from high school. He has earned his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees \nat U.S. universities. He and his facility security officer documented the termination of his \naccess to his German passport. Applicant provided employment evaluations and \n\n \n17 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nstatements from friends. His character references, marketing award, and voluntary \nsupport of emergency services evidence his dedication, responsibility, trustworthiness, \nprofessionalism, reliability, integrity, and active involvement in his community. Although \nthe possibility of attempted exploitation of Applicant is relatively low, Applicant\u2019s strong \nconnections to the United States and especially to his U.S. community and employment \nestablish \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., he can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  See AG \u00b6 8(b).  \n \nAfter weighing the evidence of his connections to Germany, to Iran, and to the \nUnited States, and all the facts in this decision, I conclude Applicant has carried his \nburden of mitigating the foreign preference and foreign influence security concerns. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d8 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, all the evidence in this decision, and my interpretation of my responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:    \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.g: \n For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.i:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n8See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

On December 8, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 16, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Mark Harvey granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department\nCounsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n2\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his\nanalysis of the Guideline B disqualifying conditions; whether the Judge erred in his application of\nthe pertinent mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding error, we reverse.\nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a senior research\nscientist who requires a security clearance \u201cto enhance his employment.\u201d  Decision at 3.  He earned\ndegrees in mathematics and computer science from U.S. universities.  \nApplicant was born in the U. S.  His mother was a citizen of Germany and, as a consequence,\nApplicant acquired German citizenship by virtue of birth.

He has traveled\nto Germany and other countries of the European Union on that passport.  He surrendered his passport\nto his security facility officer in 2008.  Since attaining his majority, Applicant has received medical\ntreatment in Germany at the partial expense of the German government and holds a German driver\u2019s\nlicense.\nApplicant told an OPM investigator that he was not willing to renounce his German\ncitizenship and that he intends to remain a citizen of Germany.  In a later response to interrogatories\npropounded by DOHA, Applicant stated that he had a duty and obligation to follow Germany\u2019s law\nand fulfill the responsibilities of a German citizen.  \nHe subsequently stated that he intended to be bound by the laws both of the U.S. and of\nGermany.  He stated, \u201cI will not violate the U.S. laws or Constitution.\u201d  Id. at 4.  Although he does\nnot intend to move to Germany, he could do so if necessitated by employment concerns.   \nApplicant\u2019s father is a dual citizen of Germany and Iran.  A retired physician, Applicant\u2019s\nfather visits Iran approximately once a year.  Applicant\u2019s mother is deceased.  Applicant traveled to\nGermany on his U.S. passport to attend her funeral.  \nApplicant has three uncles who are citizens of Iran.  One lives in the U.S. and is \u201cprobably\nstill an Iranian citizen.\u201d  Id. at 5.  Another of Applicant\u2019s Iranian uncles lives in a European country.\nApplicant has a half-interest in a piece of German real estate, valued at approximately\n700,000 Euros.  The rental income derived from this property has varied from 300 Euros a month\nto 3,000.  Applicant and his co-owner are attempting to sell the property.  After the hearing,\nApplicant submitted a letter from a German attorney attesting to a \u201ccontract of mandate regarding\nthe sale of [the] real estate . . . After consultation with the tax consultant, [his attorney] will submit\n\n3\na proposal for further proceedings.  Id.  Applicant has a German bank account with approximately\n6,000 Euros in it.  \u201cAt the hearing, Applicant said he intended to close the account.\u201d  Id.\nHe owns a house in the U.S. valued at about $87,000.  He has about $30,000 in U.S. bank\naccounts and $35,000 in retirement accounts.  He enjoys an excellent reputation for job performance,\nhonesty, generosity, and patriotism.  \nIran is a country that engages in a clandestine effort to obtain weapons of mass destruction,\nsponsors terrorism, intervenes in the internal affairs of Iraq, undermines the Middle East peace\nprocess, and violates human rights.  It has sought illegally to obtain U.S. military and sensitive\ntechnology.  \nGermany is an ally of the U.S. and its second largest trading partner.  Nearly a quarter of U.S.\ncitizens have some German ancestry.\nDiscussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.10(a)(1).\n1\nDirective \u00b6 E2.10(a)(3).\n2\nDirective \u00b6 E2.7(a).\n3\nDirective \u00b6 E2.7(b).  \n4\nDirective \u00b6 E2.7(e).  \n5\n4\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge concluded that the evidence raised two\nForeign Preference disqualifying conditions (FPDC)\u201310(a)(1),  possession of a foreign passport, and\n1\n10(a)(3),  accepting medical or other benefits from a foreign country.  As the Judge\u2019s findings\n2\ndemonstrate, Applicant\u2019s receipt of medical treatment in Germany, and his German passport and \ndriver\u2019s license establish these disqualifying conditions.  The Judge also concluded that the case\nraised two Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions (FIDC)\u20137(a),  contact with, inter alia, a\n3\nforeign family member, etc, which creates a risk of exploitation, and 7(b),  connections to, inter alia,\n4\na foreign person that creates a potential conflict of interest.  Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives, both in\nGermany and in Iran, establish these conditions.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred, however, in not concluding that the\nevidence also raised FIDC 7(e),  a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign\n5\ncountry, which might subject the applicant to foreign coercion.  Department Counsel points to\nApplicant\u2019s share in the German real property, valued at over 700,000 Euros, and his German bank\naccount, valued at around 6,000 Euros.  Department Counsel notes that, when viewed in comparison\nwith Applicant\u2019s financial interests in the U.S., Applicant\u2019s German holdings constitute the\nsubstantial majority of his net worth. Under these circumstances, the record establishes a substantial\nproperty interest in Germany.  Given record evidence of Applicant\u2019s ties to that country, it is\nforeseeable that this interest could be a means through which Applicant could be subjected to foreign\ninfluence.  See ISCR Case No. 07-06364 at 2 (App. Bd. May 28, 2008)(\u201cApplicant\u2019s Egyptian\nholdings, which include a condominium valued at $170,000 and a bank account worth $100,000,\nmust be considered substantial and could subject Applicant to heightened risk of foreign influence\nor exploitation[.]\u201d)  See also ISCR Case No. 08-04488 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 23, 2009)(In a Guideline\nB case the Government is not required to prove affirmatively that a country specifically targets U.S.\ncitizens in order to gather protected information.  The \u201cheightened risk\u201d language in the Guideline\naddresses an applicant\u2019s contacts, not necessarily the country in which the contact is located).  Under\nthe facts of this case, Applicants\u2019 circumstances are sufficient to establish FCDC 7(e).  The Judge\u2019s\nfailure to discuss this disqualifying condition is error.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis of Applicant\u2019 father\u2019s visits to Iran is\nerroneous.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  The concern regarding the father\u2019s visits to\n\n\u201c[Applicant] views his citizenship as a contract with that country.  When [Applicant] was asked if he was\n6\nwilling to relinquish his German citizenship, he claimed that was like asking a father to give up a child, he could not do\nit.\u201d  Summary of Personal Subject Interview (SPIN) conducted in December 2007.  At the hearing, he reiterated his\nintention to retain his German citizenship.  Tr. at 34.  Applicant also stated that he was bound by the laws of Germany\nand viewed his dual \u201ccitizenships as an opportunity . . . to live, work and travel in most of North America and Europe.\u201d\nSPIN, supra.  As stated in the Judge\u2019s findings, Applicant foresees a possibility that economic circumstances may require\nhim to move back to Germany.  \n5\nIran grows out of Applicant\u2019s ties to his father.  The Judge\u2019s favorable resolution of the issue relies\non mis-stating the concern as to Applicant\u2019s ties to Iran.  The security vulnerability is correctly\nalluded to by the Judge (\u201cIranian authorities could use Applicant\u2019s father to coerce Applicant.\u201d\nDecision at 15-16).  However, he then resolves the issue by comparing Applicant\u2019s ties to the U.S.\nto his ties to Iran, which is not the correct analysis of this issue.  \n Concerning mitigation, the Board notes that the Judge did not attempt to clear Applicant\nthrough the mitigating conditions in and of themselves.  Rather, he did so by means of his whole-\nperson analysis.  This analysis balanced Applicant\u2019s ties to his German family members with his ties\nto the U.S. and with his excellent reputation in this country.  Missing from the whole-person\nanalysis, however, is any discussion in Applicant\u2019s property interests in Germany, due to the Judge\nhaving failed to discover in those interests substantial evidence of FCMC 7(e).  Department Counsel\nargues that the record evidence will not sustain a conclusion that Applicant has mitigated security\nconcerns arising from this foreign property.\nThe Board notes Applicant\u2019s stated intention to close out the German bank account.\nHowever, he had not closed it out as of the close of the record.  Applicant also stated that he and his\nco-owner intended to sell the real property.  Despite the Judge\u2019s having provided Applicant with\nseveral weeks post-hearing in which to demonstrate divestiture, Applicant provided only one\ndocument, the letter from the German attorney quoted in the Judge\u2019s findings, confirming a \u201ccontract\nof mandate\u201d and advising that \u201ca proposal for further proceedings\u201d is forthcoming.  Neither the\nrecord, nor Applicant\u2019s reply brief, further elaborate on this issue, either by explaining what a\ncontract of mandate is or by discussing what further proceedings are required or contemplated.  As\nDepartment Counsel states, \u201c[w]hile Applicant may have asserted that he intends to divest himself\nof his rental property and his foreign bank account, there is no record evidence that he actually did\nso or that he even made any attempts to do so.\u201d   Department Counsel Brief at 23.  The evidence\nsupports this statement, because, at the close of the record, Applicant still owned the properties under\nconsideration.  The record contains a paucity of evidence to demonstrate mitigation of the security\nconcern arising out of Applicant\u2019s foreign property interests.  Viewing the record as a whole and in\nlight of the Egan standard, and specifically taking into account record evidence of Applicant\u2019s ties\nto Germany  and the problems inherent in Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s ties and visits to Iran, the Board\n6\ncannot conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision under Guideline B is sustainable.\n \n\n6\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 7, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on April 22, 2008. DOHA \n                                                          \n1 The SOR was undated. The date was added without objection. \n \nJune 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nissued a notice of hearing on May 8, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nJune 2, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, but did not submit documentary \nevidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 12, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel made an oral motion to amend SOR \u00b6 1.j by changing the \ndate in the allegation from \u201c1007\u201d to \u201c2007.\u201d Applicant did not object to the motion and it \nwas granted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR, but noted that the debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d were duplicates, and the debts \nin \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f were also duplicates.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He married in 1997 \nand was earning a good salary. He separated from his wife and moved to another city in \nabout 2001. He worked a series of lower paying jobs. He had a car voluntarily \nrepossessed in about 2002. He and his wife divorced in late 2002 or early 2003. He has \nno children. Applicant decided he needed a change in his life. He was accepted into a \npremier engineering university and started in the fall of 2003. He graduated Summa \nCum Laude with a 3.98 grade point average and received a Bachelor of Science degree \nin engineering in 2007.2  \n \n \nWhen Applicant went to college, he made a conscious decision to not pay the \ndebts he had accrued. He could not afford to go to college and pay his past debts. He \nworked part-time during school. He paid his living expenses but did not earn enough to \naddress his delinquent debts. It was his intention to pay his debts after he graduated \nand started earning a salary. He additionally has almost $70,000 in student loans.3   \n \n \nApplicant was hired by his current employer in July 2007. He bought a car \nthrough financing after he graduated, but 3,000 miles later the engine blew out. A co-\nworker was moving and sold Applicant his car for $15,000. Applicant is making \npayments of $505 to him every two weeks for the car. The loan is down to about \n$6,000. He believes the loan will be paid in full by about November 2008. He has not \nstarted paying his delinquent debts because of the auto loan. His company paid him for \nrelocation expenses and he used that money to replace the engine on the original car. \nHe stated that car was paid off and he has put it up for sale. He plans on using the \nmoney he receives from the sale of the car to negotiate settlements on his delinquent \n                                                          \n2 Tr. at 19-20, 34-35; GE 1. \n \n3 Tr. at 19-23. \n \n\n \n3 \n \ndebts. He plans on addressing any remaining delinquent debts after his car is paid off in \nNovember 2008.4  \n \n \nApplicant admitted at the hearing that the debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d are not \nduplicates. I find that the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f are duplicates. He has made no \npayments on the remaining nine debts alleged in the SOR, totaling more than $34,000. \nHe has not received financial counseling.5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 20-30; GE 1. \n \n5 Tr. at 18-19, 24; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR. \n \n\n \n4 \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of these \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n\n \n5 \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant made a conscious decision to disregard his debts in order to pursue his \neducation. That is not a condition that was largely beyond his control. His stated intent \nwas to pay his debts after he graduated and started earning a decent salary. He \ngraduated in 2007, and obtained a good job as an engineer in July 2007. His plans were \nagain placed on hold when the engine of his car blew out. He is paying more than \n$1,000 per month on another car and expects to pay it off in November 2008. He fixed \nthe engine on the first car and has it for sale. He plans on using the proceeds to \nnegotiate settlements for his debts. While Applicant has stated his intentions to pay his \ndebts, he has not started addressing any of them. I find that none of the mitigating \nconditions are fully applicable.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f are duplicates. SOR \u00b6 1.f is concluded for Applicant. SOR \n\u00b61.k alleges that Applicant had an automobile voluntarily repossessed in 2002. It is \nunclear if this resulted in a deficiency. It is also unclear if any of the debts alleged in the \nSOR reflect that deficiency. SOR \u00b6 1.k is concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. It is difficult to fault Applicant\u2019s \ndecision to pursue his engineering degree. He made a conscious choice to put off \npaying his delinquent debts until after he graduated. He was tremendously successful in \ncollege, graduating Summa Cum Laude, and he obtained a good job as an engineer. \nHe has an accelerated payment schedule of $505 every two weeks on his car loan. He \nagain decided not to address his delinquent debts until after he pays off his car. I am left \nwith Applicant\u2019s bare assertions that he will begin paying his delinquent debts. Without \nsome good-faith effort to address his debts, I am unable to find on his behalf. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nEdward W.

She \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d in response to question 28(a) \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over \n180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d She also answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to question \n28(b) \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d (Gov 1.)  \n \nA subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had the following  \ndelinquent accounts:  a $516 judgment related to a medical account entered in \nDecember 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 1); a $129 medical account placed for \ncollection in November 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 3 at 10); a $243 account placed for \ncollection in April 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 4 at 2); a $389 credit card account \nthat was charged off in April 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 3 at 8; Gov 4 at 2); a $161 account \nthat was charged off in March 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 3 at 10; Gov 4 at 2); a $1,465 \ncredit card account that was charged off in December 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 3 at 5; Gov \n4 at 2); a $1,751 account that was charged off in December 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 3 at \n9; Gov 4 at 2); a $1,070 credit card account placed for collection in March 2002 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h: Gov 4 at 2); a $687 department store credit card account charged off in May 2002 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 3 at 8; Gov 4 at 2); an $867 credit card account that was charged off in \nApril 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.j; Gov 4 at 2); a $215 delinquent cell phone account placed for \ncollection in September 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.k; Gov 4 at 2); a $501 jewelry store account \ncharged off in July 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 3 at 8; Gov 4 at 2); a $3,409 mail order \ncatalogue account placed for collection in July 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 3 at 10); a $942  \naccount placed for collection in September 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.n: Gov 3 at 9); and a $289 \njudgment filed against Applicant in December 2003 related to a medical account (SOR \u00b6 \n1.o: Gov 3 at 3).    \n \nAt hearing, Applicant admitted that she owes all the bills. She is unable to pay off \nany of the accounts alleged in the SOR. She has not contacted any of the creditors \nlisted in the SOR. (Tr at 18-19.) \n \nApplicant works four days a week and does not have extra money to apply \ntowards her debts. She is a diabetic. She does not have health insurance because she \ncannot afford it. Her net monthly income is $832 a month. She receives $788 a month \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfrom social security for her twin sons. Her total household income is $1,620. Her total \nmonthly expenses is $1,535. She has $85 left over each month after expenses.  (Tr at \n19-21.)  \n \nIn 2003, when Applicant was pregnant with her youngest daughter, she was \nhospitalized off and on as a result of complications related to her diabetes.  She was on \nMedicaid when she was hospitalized. She currently takes insulin which costs \napproximately $80 per month and sugar pills which are approximately $50. (Tr at 23, \n29.)  \n \nHer husband passed away in 1999. Prior to his death, his monthly income was \napproximately $1,200 a month. Applicant previously worked in a convenience store that \nwent out of business. She had no gap in employment between her last job and her \ncurrent job. Her income is about the same. She is thinking of getting a part-time job. Her \nsupervisor was going to try to give her more hours. She currently works four eight hour \nshifts. (Tr at 24-26.) \n \nApplicant testified that she was aware that she had delinquent debts at the time \nshe completed her e-QIP application in September 2007. She told her supervisor that \nshe had poor credit. She did not list her delinquent accounts on her e-QIP application. \nShe is not sure why she did not list her delinquent accounts on her security clearance \napplication. (Tr at 26-27, 31-32.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has accumulated \napproximately 15 delinquent accounts from 2001 to 2007. The total approximate \nbalance of the delinquent debt is $12,634.  Applicant is unable to pay these debts due \nto her limited income. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial irresponsibility is too recent to apply this mitigating \ncondition.  All of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR remain unresolved. \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. Applicant struggled \nfinancially after he husband passed away in 1999. Three of the accounts are medical \nbills. Applicant suffers from diabetes and has no health insurance. There were \ncircumstances beyond her control that adversely affected Applicant\u2019s finances. \nHowever, Applicant has made no attempt to resolve her delinquent accounts.  It cannot \nbe concluded that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. She does not \nearn enough income to resolve her delinquent accounts. None of the delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR have been resolved. It is unlikely that her financial \nsituation will be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Applicant has not taken steps \ntowards resolving her delinquent accounts. Primarily, because she does not have the \nincome to pay her delinquent debts.   \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list her \ndelinquent debts in response to questions 28(a) and 28(b) on her security clearance \n\n \n6 \n \n \napplication, dated September 13, 2007. Applicant admits that she was aware that she \nhad delinquent debts at the time she completed her security clearance application. She \nadmits that she did not list her delinquent accounts on her security clearance \napplication. She could not explain why she failed to list her delinquent accounts on her \nsecurity clearance application. Under Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Condition (PC \nDC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities) applies to Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern can be mitigated. The following Personal Conduct \nMitigating Conditions (PC MC) have the potential to apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct \nthe omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts) \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c ) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or \nthe behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and \nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps \nto alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur) \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(e) applies because in response to the SOR, Applicant admits that \nshe has delinquent debts and that she intentionally did not list her delinquent accounts \non her security clearance application. Her admissions reduce her vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. However, she has not met her burden to \ncompletely mitigate the security concerns raised under personal conduct. She did not \nmake a prompt, good-faith effort to correct her omissions before being confronted with \nthe facts. She was unable to explain why she failed to indicate that she had delinquent \naccounts in response to sections 28(a) and 28(b) on her security clearance application, \neven though she admits to being aware that she had delinquent accounts at the time \nshe completed the application. There is insufficient evidence in the record to apply the \nother personal conduct mitigating conditions to Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline E.   \n \n \n  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s medical \ncondition, and that she is a single mother supporting three minor children. I also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s limited income which prevents her from resolving her delinquent \naccounts. An inability to pay one\u2019s debts remains a security concern under financial \nconsiderations. Her deliberate omission of her delinquent accounts on her security \nclearance application raises concerns about her trustworthiness and reliability. The \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $22,951 for 16 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.p); and that, according to a personal financial statement he submitted on April 29, 2008, he has a monthly net remainder after expenses (not including repayment of any delinquencies) of approximately $282 (SOR 1.q). Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. As to SOR \u00b6 1.q, the facts alleged are relevant to this decision; however, they are not potentially disqualifying in and of themselves. Rather, this allegation pleads relevant evidence of Applicant\u2019s current finances, which I have considered in reaching my decision. SOR \u00b6 1.q is concluded for the Applicant. I have also made the following additional findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 33 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since January 2006. According to his e-QIP, Applicant was unemployed for about 18 months before he found his current job. Between February 2002 and June 2004, he worked as a forklift operator. He also served in the United States Army Reserve from October 1996 until August 2004. (Gx. 1) Applicant was married from June 1997 until May 2004, when he and his wife were officially divorced.

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, the government\u2019s exhibits (Gx.),\nApplicant\u2019s exhibits (Ax.), and Applicant\u2019s testimony, his request for a security clearance\nis denied.\nOn May 19, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for his job with\na defense contractor, where he works as a fiber optics assembler. (Gx. 1) On March 7,\n2008, after reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators\nfor the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent to Applicant\ninterrogatories to obtain clarification of and/or additional information about adverse\ninformation in his background.  After reviewing the results of the background\n1\ninvestigation, including his response to the interrogatories (Gx. 2), DOHA adjudicators\nDecember 23, 2008\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n2\nthe national interest to allow Applicant access to classified information. On July 23,\n2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which\nraise security concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under\n3\nGuideline F (financial considerations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on September 24, 2008, and I convened a hearing on October 22,\n2008. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented two exhibits (Gx.\n1 and 2). Applicant testified and submitted one exhibit (Ax. A). I also left the record open\nafter the hearing to receive additional relevant information. On October 30, 2008, I\nreceived a post-hearing submission, which is included in the record without objection as\nAx. B. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on November 6, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $22,951\nfor 16 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.p); and that, according to a personal financial\nstatement he submitted on April 29, 2008, he has a monthly net remainder after\nexpenses (not including repayment of any delinquencies) of approximately $282 (SOR\n1.q). Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. As to SOR \u00b6 1.q, the facts alleged\nare relevant to this decision; however, they are not potentially disqualifying in and of\nthemselves. Rather, this allegation pleads relevant evidence of Applicant\u2019s current\nfinances, which I have considered in reaching my decision. SOR \u00b6 1.q is concluded for\nthe Applicant. I have also made the following additional findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since\nJanuary 2006. According to his e-QIP, Applicant was unemployed for about 18 months\nbefore he found his current job. Between February 2002 and June 2004, he worked as\na forklift operator. He also served in the United States Army Reserve from October 1996\nuntil August 2004. (Gx. 1) \nApplicant was married from June 1997 until May 2004, when he and his wife\nwere officially divorced. However, Applicant and his wife actually separated after only\nsix months. They had one child together. Applicant also has three children by another\nwoman. He pays about $820 each month in child support. In 2005, two warrants for his\narrest were issued for alleged failure to pay child support as ordered; however, it does\nnot appear that he is currently in arrears on his child support obligations. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2;\nTr. 42, 46)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n3\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties date back to his failure to pay a telephone bill in\n2001. (Tr. 17, 32) He acknowledges being \u201can idiot\u201d in that he was not paying attention\nto his debts and spending habits. (Tr. 27) Around 2004, he developed blood clots that\nrequired hospitalization for about two weeks. At the time, he did not have health\ninsurance and was turned down for Medicaid coverage. He admitted that he ignored his\nmedical bills because he did not have the means to pay them. As a result, he still owes\napproximately $6,543 for eight delinquent medical bills listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d - 1.k. He\nhas not contacted those creditors. (Gx. 2; Tr. 29, 35 - 36)\nOf the remaining $16,408 in delinquent debts listed in the SOR, Applicant owes\napproximately $15,475 for a car repossession in 2007. (SOR \u00b6 1.o) Applicant had\nfinanced a car and made about four payments before he went on extended travel for his\njob. He left the car with a girlfriend for her to use, and he sent her money with which he\nexpected her to make the monthly payments. She used the car as her own, but did not\nmake any payments. Applicant has not contacted this creditor; nor has he taken any\nsteps to resolve this debt, which he estimates is now at least $18,000. (Gx. 2; Tr. 29 -\n30, 48 - 54)\nThe remaining seven delinquent debts total $923. Applicant has repaid one of the\ndebts, a $169 corporate credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.m). The debt was satisfied only\nafter it grew to over $5,000 and his wages were garnished starting in November 2007.\nThe last payment was scheduled for the Friday after this hearing. The remaining six\ndebts total $754, an average of $126 per account. Applicant has not contacted any of\nthese creditors or taken any action to resolve these debts. (Gx. 2; Ax. B; Tr. 32 - 33)\nAccording to letters of reference from two co-workers and a supervisor, Applicant\nis a good, reliable employee. The letters presented do not reflect any knowledge of the\nadverse information about his finances. (Ax. A) Applicant loves his job and wants to\nresolve his finances because he now realizes the importance of good credit. (Tr. 18, 27\n- 28)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n5\nThe government presented sufficient information to support all of the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6 1. Available information also shows Applicant has not paid or resolved any of\nthe debts listed therein. Some of the debts have been delinquent for up to seven years.\nApplicant acknowledged willful neglect of his finances and has yet to contact any of his\ncreditors to pay or resolve even the most modest of his debts. He also demonstrated\npoor judgment regarding his car loan obligation. The record in this case requires\napplication of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts), at AG \u00b6 19(b) (indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or\nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt) and at AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations).\nIn response, Applicant has not presented any information that would support\napplication of any of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20. His financial problems are\nrecent, in that they remain unresolved. As to his medical debts, they arguably were due\nto circumstances beyond his control. However, because he has decided to ignore them,\nhe may not benefit from the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b)(the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances). Applicant\nhas not made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. In fact, the one debt he has paid\nwas through involuntary wage deductions for a delinquent corporate credit card. He has\nnot sought any financial counseling or other assistance that would help him improve his\npersonal financial condition. In summary, Applicant has failed to overcome the adverse\ninformation about his finances.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 33 years old and\npresumed to be a mature adult. However, he has demonstrated since at least 2001 a\ncomplete disregard for his personal financial affairs, including at times his child support\nobligations. While there is positive information about his job performance, there is no\npositive information about his current finances or to show he knows how to manage his\nmoney better now than before. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available\n8\ninformation shows Applicant has not satisfied the doubts about his suitability for access\nto classified information that are established by the results of the government\u2019s\ninvestigation. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.9\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\n Subparagraph 1.a - 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\n Subparagraph 1.q:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He has failed to mitigate\nthe security concern caused by his alcohol consumption. \nOn May 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline G (alcohol consumption). Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to the SOR was received by DOHA on June 23, 2008. Applicant admitted all\nSOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n Applicant was notified of the hearing date by Department Counsel on August 13, 2008. He agreed\n2\nat that time to the hearing date of September 5, 2008, and waived on the record any objection he might have\nin the event he did not timely receive the formal notice of hearing. (Tr. pp. 17-19)  \n2\nThe case was assigned to me on August 12, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued\non August 20, 2008, scheduling the hearing for September 5, 2008.  The hearing was\n2\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted two documentary exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-2. GE 1 was admitted into the record without\nobjection. Applicant\u2019s objection to admission of the partial Report of Investigation (ROI)\ncontained in GE 2 was sustained. The remainder of GE 2 was admitted into the record\nwithout objection. Applicant testified but did not submit any documentary exhibits. The\ntranscript was received on September 18, 2008.     \nProcedural Issues\nDepartment Counsel moved at the hearing to amend the SOR by changing the\nname of the city listed in subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c to conform to the evidence. Each\namendment was made on the face of the SOR without objection.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 24-year-old single man who has been employed as an electrical\nengineer by a defense contractor since January 2007. He worked as an intern for this\nsame defense during the summer of 2006. Applicant graduated from college in December\n2006, and was awarded a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering. \nApplicant was convicted of Possession/Consumption of Alcohol Under the Legal\nAge in August 2002 and again in May 2003. He was fined on both occasions. Applicant\nwas a college student when these offenses occurred. \nIn August 2007, following his graduation from college and while he was employed\nby the defense contractor, Applicant was charged with public intoxication. In this incident,\nhe was arrested, handcuffed, booked into a jail and held in a cell overnight. He was\nconvicted and fined $135.\nIn November 2007, Applicant was charged with Operating a Vehicle While Impaired\n(OWI). His blood alcohol content (BAC) was 0.17. Applicant was again booked into a jail\nand held overnight. He was convicted of this offense in February 2008, and sentenced to\nserve two days in jail (suspended), fined $1,250, and had his driving privileges revoked for\n30 days and an ignition interlock system installed in his car for six months. He was also\nordered to attend a session wherein he was required to remain incarcerated in a hotel for\ntwo days while attending alcohol awareness classes.\n\n3\nApplicant obtained an alcohol evaluation following the OWI arrest. The certified\nalcohol and drug counselor (CADC) from a court recognized alcohol program indicated\nApplicant met the DSM IV criteria for alcohol \u201cabuse.\u201d (GE 2) Her recommendations were\nas follows:\n(Applicant) tested High Probability of having a Substance Dependence\nDisorder on the SASSI, did not meet the criteria for Dependence on the\nDSM-IV, and did not meet the criteria for Substance Abuse Treatment on the\nASAM, the Client Assessment Form, and through the interview I conducted\nthis date. Therefore No Treatment is being recommended at this time. If\nthere are any further substance related problems (this includes positive\nurinalysis) there would be a need for another screening to determine what\ntreatment options would be considered at that time. (GE 2)\nOn March 8, 2008, Applicant was charged with Public Intoxication while in a state\nother than where he resides. He testified he had only consumed a few beers, but admitted\nhe was found by the police passed out on a public way. He suggested, without any\nsupporting evidence, that he was unwittingly drugged by a bartender. He received some\nsort of deferred adjudication for this offense within the past few months. \nApplicant began consuming alcohol on weekends while he was in high school. He\nadmits he occasionally became intoxicated during this time. While in college, he consumed\nbeer on almost every Friday and Saturday night and became intoxicated on most\nweekends. In April 2008, in response to interrogatories propounded to him by DOHA,\nApplicant stated he consumes about 10 drinks per week. He testified he now only drinks\ntwo to three beers a week. At the hearing, in response to a question from Department\nCounsel inquiring if he had become intoxicated at any time following his March 2008 arrest,\nApplicant testified:\nNot intoxicated to the point that I was being irresponsible, just slightly, you\nknow a couple of beers. If you\u2019re going by the law, .08, yes; intoxicated to the\npoint where I was being irresponsible, no. (Tr. pp. 55-56)\nApplicant has not received any alcohol treatment. He intends to continue consuming\nalcohol.  \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G (alcohol consumption)\nwith its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n4\n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment\nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness. (Adjudicative Guideline [AG] \u00b6 21)  \nApplicant has been charged with and/or convicted of alcohol-related offenses on five\noccasions since 2002. His most recent offense occurred in March 2008, less than one\nmonth after he was convicted of OWI and required to attend alcohol awareness classes\nwhile being detained in a hotel. He has been diagnosed as alcohol abusive by a CADC.\n\n5\nHe has not received any alcohol treatment. He admits he has consumed alcohol to excess\nsince his last arrest and has expressed an intent to consume alcohol in the future.  \nDisqualifying Conditions (DC): 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such\nas driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace,\nor other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; DC 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol\nto the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; DC 22(e): evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program all apply.\nDespite his many alcohol-related arrests, including three within a very recent seven-\nmonth period, Applicant fails to accept that he may have a serious alcohol problem and\nhas espoused his intent to continue consuming alcohol. His most recent arrest occurred\na mere six months ago and he admits to drinking to excess since then. Mitigating\nConditions (MC) 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC\n23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse,\nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a\npattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser) do\nnot apply.\nIn November 2007, the CADC wrote there would be need for another screening to\ndetermine what treatment options should be considered for Applicant. He was arrested four\nmonths later, after being found passed out on a public way, but has not sought another\nevaluation or entered into any treatment program. Thus, MC 23(d): the individual has\nsuccessfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any\nrequired aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has\nreceived a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program\ndoes not apply. The remaining mitigating condition has no applicability to the facts of this\ncase.    \n   \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis. Further, it must once again be noted that any reasonable doubt about\nwhether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting national security.\n\n6\nAccordingly, and considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances\npresent in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6\nof the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant\nhas failed to mitigate the security concern caused by his alcohol consumption. He has\nfailed to overcome the case against him in this regard or satisfy his ultimate burden of\npersuasion. Guideline G is decided against Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Applicant appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains no assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge.\nRather, it contains new evidence, in the form of an explanatory statement in which Applicant asserts\nthat he has now paid off three of his outstanding debts and is making arrangements to resolve the rest\nof them, by either paying them off or disputing them.\nThe Board cannot consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has\nalleged the Judge committed harmful error.  It does not review cases de novo. Applicant has not\nmade an allegation of harmful error.  Therefore, the decision of the Judge denying Applicant a\nsecurity clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan      \nMichael Y.

On May\n12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) stating security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response received on June 9, 2008, Applicant admitted four of the nine\nallegations raised concerning nine allegedly delinquent debts. Upon request for a\nhearing, the matter was returned to DOHA. I was assigned the case on August 18,\nDecember 4, 2008\n\n SOR \u00b6 1e; Tr. 35.\n1\n SOR \u00b6 1h.\n2\n SOR \u00b6 1g; Tr. 25-26.\n3\nThe SOR notes at \u00b6 1d a bank issued credit card. W hile the issuing bank is the same as on the card\n4\nApplicant admits he had, the credit card brand differs. Applicant denies knowledge of the card noted in the\nSOR and feels it may be the result of identity theft, but he has not formally disputed its inclusion on his credit\nreport.\n2\n2008. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to a September 16, 2008, hearing\ndate, and a Notice of Hearing to that effect was issued on August 27, 2008.\n \nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted four\nexhibits (Ex.), accepted into the record as Exs. 1-4 without objection. Applicant testified\non his own behalf. No witnesses were called and no exhibits were offered into\nevidence. Applicant was given until September 26, 2008, to submit any additional\nmaterials. On October 1, 2008, Department Counsel forwarded one document,\npreviously submitted by Applicant. Without objection, it was accepted into evidence as\nexhibit (Ex.) A. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 2, 2008, and the record\nwas closed. Based upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security\nclearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 28-year-old logistics specialist working for a government\ncontractor. He has a high school diploma and an associate\u2019s degree in electronics and\ncomputer science. He has a daughter and is co-parenting his girlfriend\u2019s son. \nIn approximately 1999, Applicant\u2019s mother bought a computer for her younger\nson. She purchased it by phone and placed the order in Applicant\u2019s name. Applicant is\nnow considered liable for approximately $2,700. He has not begun payment on the\naccount and he provided no evidence of disputing the credit report entry noting the debt\nas his.  In the same year, Applicant bought a car with his mother. It was to have been\n1\nkept in her name. He is unclear as to whether he signed as a co-signer on the car. The\nmother did not keep up with the payments, and it was repossessed. It resulted in a\nliability of about $15,000 after sale.  Applicant has not paid the account or successfully\n2\ndisputed its inclusion on his credit report as his debt.\nWhen Applicant went to college from 2001 to 2003, he attended classes full-\ntime. For income, he worked about 20 hours a week for $10 to $11 per hour. Paying for\nhis education and his apartment was difficult given his limited income. Paying bills was\na struggle. He took out student loans in his name to help defray costs. At least one loan\nwas apparently processed after he graduated in 2003. It currently shows a past due\nbalance of $371 on his credit report. Applicant, however, does not recognize the loan\nand has neither investigated it nor paid it.  During college he also had a bank-issued\n3\ncredit card with a credit limit of approximately $2,100.4\n\n Tr. 21. Applicant considers his abandonment of the property to have been a constructive eviction.\n5\n SOR \u00b6 1c.\n6\n SOR \u00b6 1i; see Ex. A; Tr.34.\n7\n Tr. 38.\n8\n See, e.g., Tr. 37-38.\n9\n3\nAfter college, Applicant struggled to find permanent, full time employment. For\nabout eight months, he lived in an apartment in which neither the heat nor air\nconditioning worked. The refrigerator broke and was not replace or repaired for several\nweeks. His apartment was twice robbed and his car was thrice vandalized in the parking\nlot. Feeling he should not be liable for rent on the apartment because of these\nproblems, he vacated the apartment before the end of his lease.  A balance owed of\n5\n$1,172 was subsequently reflected on his credit report.  He moved back home in 2004\n6\nand eventually went to truck driving school, which prepared him for a career in truck\ndriving from 2005 until the end of 2006. \nIn 2006, Applicant was in a motorcycle accident. A medical bill for about $400\nwas acquired which became delinquent. Applicant has paid that bill.  Recovery lost him\n7\nabout two weeks of work. In the end of 2006, Applicant lost his job when his truck jack-\nknifed. Unemployed for the next six months, he found a temporary job before assuming\nhis current position in May 2007. \nIn his current position, Applicant earns about $3,400 per month. After expenses,\nhe has a sum just under $400 remaining.  He is thus living within his means with regard\n8\nto his current expenses. He is earnest in wanting to repay those debts he feels are his.\nHe has not, however, received financial counseling.\nIn producing evidence that his medical account was paid or substantially paid,\nApplicant provided the sole tangible document showing he has addressed any of the\ndebts at issue in the SOR which he denied. Applicant testified he has tried to contact\nsome of his creditors, but stated he has only heard back from his medical provider. No\ncorrespondence to or from his creditors, no logs of telephonic contact with creditors, no\nletters to any of the three major credit reporting bureaus, and no proposed repayment\nplans were introduced.9\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n10\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n11\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n12\n Id.\n13\n Id.\n14\n4\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n10\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n11\n12\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n13\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n14\n\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n15\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n16\n5\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n15\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions\n16\nunder this guideline.  \nBetween 1999 and 2003, Applicant acquired eight debts which ultimately\nbecame delinquent. They represent over $25,000 in debt. All of those debts remain\nunsatisfied or unaddressed; no documentation was presented to show that any of the\ndebts noted in the SOR, except the medical account, have been the subject of\nlegitimate, formal dispute or inquiry as to a repayment plan. Consequently, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts\u201d) apply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to overcome\nthe case against him and mitigate security concerns. \nApplicant attributed the computer and car obligations to his mother and denied\nthat one credit card balance is his, but he failed to provide any evidence that he has\ntried to rectify the situation. While he has experienced periods of unemployment, he\nsimilarly failed to provide explanation as to what, if any, repayment or dispute efforts\nthose periods interrupted or provide documentation showing efforts toward addressing\nhis debts since starting his current job in 2007. Therefore, Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition (FC MC) 2, AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) cannot apply.\nWhile Applicant has shown that he has substantially paid the ninth account noted\nin the SOR, the medical account, he failed to provide evidence of any other efforts\ntoward the balance of the debts at issue. Consequently, FC MC 4, AG \u00b6 20(d), (\u201cthe\n\n6\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts\u201d) cannot apply. As well, he has not received financial counseling or demonstrated\nthat his past financial liabilities are poised for imminent satisfaction. Therefore, FC MC\n3, AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d)\ndoes not apply. Moreover, none of the other mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a forthright and earnest young man who is obviously devoted to his\nfamily. He is also genuinely committed to addressing his debts. Lacking financial\ncounseling or other budgeting guidance, however, he has reaped minimal success\nthrough his current methods for addressing his debt. While satisfaction of his medical\naccount is a good start, Applicant failed to demonstrate how the approach he only orally\ndescribed might prove more fruitful in the future. Therefore, with security concerns\nunmitigated, I conclude it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He further claimed that he \u201cwrote letter to [Cap One] to work out\npayment plan or pay off acc,\u201d \u201ccalled [Arrow Ser] on May 6 , 15, and 16  [but received]\nth\nth\nno call back,\u201d \u201ccalled [Chase NA and is] working out deal to refinance house to pay for\naccount or get it dismissed due to age of account,\u201d and \u201ctalked to credit agency\u201d\nhandling the Comp USA debt and \u201cworked out payment plan down payment of 152.00\nthen monthly payments of 100.00 a month.\u201d He offered no credible evidence\ncorroborating these contacts.\nThe evidence does not establish that applicant is indebted as alleged in SOR\nParagraphs 1c, 1d, 1e, 1g, 1j, 1o, 1r, and 1s.\nIn his response to the SOR, applicant stated his financial delinquencies were the\n\u201cresult of being laid off three times in two years.\u201d He further stated he has \u201cjust recently\ngotten where [he] was financially able to start paying them off.\u201d\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\n\n3\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of an inability or\nunwillingness to pay his debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant has numerous\ndelinquent debts that are still outstanding. This mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\n\n4\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\nstated in his SOR response that his financial delinquencies were the result of being laid\noff three times in two years. But he failed to provide any details about these layoffs.\nWithout any details, and with an August 2007 security questionnaire in evidence\nindicating he has been working for his current employer since 2001, there is insufficient\nevidence to apply this mitigating condition.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20. c. There is no credible evidence that\napplicant has received or is receiving counseling. Nor are there clear indications that his\nfinancial problems are actually being resolved or that they are under control.\nAccordingly, this mitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant claims\nhe has settled some debts and has made contact with several other creditors. Even if\nhis uncorroborated statements were accepted as true, the vast majority of his\nindebtedness has not been addressed in any meaningful way. He therefore has not\ninitiated \u201ca good faith effort to repay overdue creditors.\u201d This mitigating condition is not\napplicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who has\na long history of not meeting his financial obligations. Although he may have recently\npaid off a few of the small debts, all of his large past-due debts remain unpaid, and the\nevidence does not establish he is likely to resolve these debts any time soon. Under the\ncircumstances, I have no choice but to conclude applicant failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns arising from Guideline F.\n\n5\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Her eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) Questionnaire on August 27, 2007. On July 14, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nOctober 16, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn August 8, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 26, \n2008. I convened a hearing on September 19, 2008, to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant.  The Government called no witnesses and introduced five exhibits, which \nwere marked Ex. 1 through 5 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on her own behalf. She called no witnesses and offered no exhibits. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on September 22, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 16 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.p.) and one allegation of disqualifying conduct \nunder AG E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.).  In her Answer to the SOR, dated August \n8, 2008, Applicant admitted all Guideline F and Guideline E allegations. At her hearing, \nshe admitted again that she was responsible for and had not paid the debts alleged on \nthe SOR. She also admitted that she failed to acknowledge the debts in response to \nQuestion 28a on the e-QIP she signed and certified on August 27, 2008.  Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are admitted herein as findings of fact. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 21, 35; Ex. D.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old, unmarried, and the mother of a six-year-old child.  She \nis a high school graduate and holds an associate of arts degree in general studies.  She \nhas been employed as a contract security guard for at least seven years.  From \nSeptember 2004 until June 2006, Applicant worked full-time as a contract security \nguard.  From June 2006 until December 2006, she had part-time employment as a \nsecurity guard. She resumed full-time employment as a security guard in January 2007 \nwith her present employer, a government contractor. She was employed in that status \nuntil July 2008, when her eligibility for a security clearance was suspended as a result of \nreceiving the SOR.  She has been unemployed since July 2008.  She is not receiving \nunemployment compensation. (Ex. 1; Tr. 39-43, 49-52.)   \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, that she was responsible for 16 \nfinancial delinquencies totaling approximately $15,503. The SOR alleged the following \ndelinquencies: an unsatisfied deficiency balance of approximately $8,745 owed to a \ncredit union for a charged-off loan financing an automobile that was voluntarily \nrepossessed (SOR \u00b6 1.h.); a $108 debt, in collection status, to a utility company which \nwas unpaid as of June 24, 2008 (SOR \u00b61.a.); a $760 debt, in collection status, for cable \ntelevision service, which was unpaid as of June 24, 2008 (SOR \u00b61.b.); a $512 debt, in \ncollection status, which was unpaid as of June 24, 2008 (SOR \u00b61.c.); a medical debt of \n$1,123, referred for collection and unpaid as of June 24, 2008 (SOR \u00b61.d.); a debt of \n$897, referred for collection and unpaid as of June 24, 2008 (SOR \u00b61.e.); a debt of \n$536, referred for collection and unpaid as of June 24, 2008 (SOR \u00b61.f.); and a debt of \n$401 to a utility company, which had been referred for collection and was unpaid as of \nJune 24, 2008 (SOR \u00b61.g.). (Ex. 5.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nThe SOR also alleged the following unpaid financial delinquencies: a $345 debt \nin collection status, which was unpaid as of September 7, 2007 (SOR \u00b61.i.); a medical \ndebt of $286, referred for collection and unpaid as of September 7, 2007 (SOR \u00b61.j.); a  \ndebt of $150, referred for collection and unpaid as of September 7, 2007 (SOR \u00b61.k.); \nand debts of $72, $111, $894, $330, and $233, all in collection status and all unpaid as \nof September 7, 2007 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l., 1.m., 1.n., 1.o., and 1.p.)  (Ex. 2.) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial problems began in about June 2006 when her \nemployer put her on part-time work and pay for six months.  From January 2007 until \nshe was suspended in July 2008, she held a full-time job. Her credit bureau report of \nSeptember 7, 2007, showed two judgments, one for $703 and one for $1,229, filed \nagainst her in 2001. The record reflected that Applicant satisfied both judgments in May \n2005. (Tr. 21-22;  Ex.2.) \n \n \nApplicant has not received child support from her son\u2019s father for over a year. \nShe is receiving some support from her state\u2019s social services program. Her son was \nborn prematurely and suffers from asthma and allergies; he requires year-round medical \nattention for these conditions. Applicant reported that a Federal health insurance \nprogram was paying her son\u2019s medical expenses.  (Tr. 22, 44, 53.)  \n \n \nApplicant inquired about consumer credit counseling in July 2007 and May 2008.  \nShe has discussed credit counseling over the telephone with a representative of a credit \ncounseling program, but she has been advised that she lacks sufficient financial stability \nto take advantage of the program\u2019s services.  Applicant applied for debt consolidation \nloans in May, July, and August 2008. Each time she applied, she was turned down \nbecause of her weak financial position.  At the time of her hearing, she was not current \non her rent payments.  (Tr. 28-29, 31-32, 38.)  \n \n \nApplicant completed and certified her e-QIP on August 27, 2007. In response to \nSection 28, entitled \u201cYour Financial Delinquencies,\u201d Applicant responded \u201cno\u201d to \nQuestion 28a.  Question 28a reads: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days \ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d  Directions following Question 28a read: \u201cIf you answered \n\u201cYes\u201d to [28]a . . . provide an entry for each occurrence to report.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant admitted she knew she had debts that were over 180 days delinquent \nwhen she completed Question 28a.  She was unsure and didn\u2019t know about all of her \ndebts.  However, when she tried to answer \u201cyes,\u201d she did not know how many debts to \nlist. She was advised by the person who helped all employees at her company fill out \ntheir security clearances to answer the question \u201cno\u201d and address the delinquencies \nlater.   (Tr. 27, 54-57.)        \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n\n \n4 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable \nor unwilling to pay her creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant admitted a history of financial difficulties. Many of her current \ndelinquencies began in about 2006, when her income was significantly reduced for \nabout six months. However, from January 2007 until July 2008, she was employed full \ntime. Applicant admitted that the 16 financial delinquencies alleged on the SOR \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nremained unresolved, resulting in substantial debt which continues to the present day, a \nsituation which raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s good judgment.   \n \nApplicant has experienced reductions in her employment and, subsequently, her \npay.  Her young son has health problems which require medical attention.  Applicant \nhas not received financial counseling. While she did not dispute her debts and admitted \nthat she was responsible for them, it was not clear that she understood her financial \nproblems or how to resolve them. She had no plan in place to systematically resolve her \nsubstantial delinquent debt and prepare for future contingencies. I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n20(b) applies in part in mitigation, but that AG \u00b6 20(a), AG \u00b6 20(c), AG \u00b6 20(d) and AG \n20(e) do not apply in mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, a personal conduct security concern arises when an \napplicant displays \u201c[conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\u201d because such \nconduct \u201ccan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d Additionally, Guideline E takes special note of \u201cany \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d AG \u00b6 15. \n \n \nI have carefully considered all of the potentially disqualifying conditions under \nGuideline E.  I have especially considered AG \u00b6 16(a).1 \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on her August 27, 2007 e-\nQIP by failing to admit any current financial delinquencies of over 90 days and any \nfinancial delinquencies within the past seven years of over 180 days. Applicant admitted \nthe falsification but denied that it was intentional.  She reported that the person who was \ntasked by her employer to advise employees in completing their e-QIP applications \nadvised her to answer \u201cno\u201d to question 28a and provide the details of her financial \ndelinquencies at a later time.  Applicant complied with this advice.  \n \n \nI carefully observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor when she testified about completing \nher e-QIP and consulting with the advisor her employer provided about how she should \nanswer Question 28a.  I found Applicant\u2019s statement of her state of mind to be credible, \nand I conclude that her falsification was not intended to mislead or deceive.  \nAccordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6 16 (a) does not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \n \n \n \n \n1 AG \u00b616(a) reads as follows: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security \nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began \nat least two years ago and continued while she was steadily employed. She has not \ntaken affirmative action to contact her creditors to discuss how she might pay or resolve \nher 16 delinquent debts. Her many financial delinquencies and her lack of attention to \nthem continue to raise security concerns.  Her current financial overextension is serious: \nshe lacks sufficient funds to pay her monthly rent, and she has been unable to find \nwork. It is unclear at this time how she will support herself and her young son. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the personal conduct security concerns but \nfailed to mitigate security concerns arising from her financial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.p: Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:             \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \n \n                     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on August 23, 2007. On March 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its action to deny her a\nsecurity clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 7, 2008, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. On April 30, 2008, the government submitted a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) consisting of eight exhibits (Items 1-8). DOHA forwarded a\ncopy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed her to respond within 30 days of receipt.\nJuly 10, 2008\n\nApplicant indicates that she raised her children on her own without the benefit of any welfare or child support\n1\n(Ex. A), although she listed in a 2004 bankruptcy filing that she had income of $219.27 per month in child\nsupport, likely for the elder of her two daughters who was then 16 and living with her.\nHer credit report of September 2007 (Item 5) indicates that she had been delinquent on a child support\n2\nobligation as of August 2003, but brought the account current.\n2\nApplicant filed a response that was received by DOHA on or about May 20, 2008, to\nwhich Department Counsel had no objections. On June 16, 2008, the case was\nassigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On receipt, the following documents\nsubmitted in rebuttal to the FORM were marked and entered as exhibits: Applicant\u2019s\nMarch 2004 bankruptcy petition as Exhibit A, her June 13, 2008, credit report as Exhibit\nB, summary of bankruptcy plan as of March 2004 as Exhibit C, her payment record\nunder the plan through June 2005 as Exhibit D, and her forwarding correspondence\nwith explanations as Exhibit E. Based upon a review of the government\u2019s FORM and\nApplicant\u2019s response (Ex. A), eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleges under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\ndelinquent debt totaling $37,386 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.aa), after a Chapter 7\nbankruptcy discharge in October 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.bb), and that she filed for a Chapter 13\nbankruptcy in March 2004 that was dismissed in March 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.cc) (Iem 1).\nApplicant acknowledged the debts alleged but submitted that all but those in SOR \u00b6 1.a\n($67 utility debt) and 1.g (federal student loan debt of $22,000) had been included in her\nChapter 13 bankruptcy. She provided documentation showing satisfaction of the debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a on April 8, 2008, and indicated she had contacted her student loan lender to\nset up payments. Applicant averred she had assumed the debts listed in her bankruptcy\nhad been paid, and she would work on getting them taken care of.  Applicant contested\nthere was any basis for concluding that she was a compulsive gambler or that she had\nreceived proceeds from financially profitable acts, presumably based on the alleged\ngeneral financial considerations concern (Item 3). The government did not allege any\nspecific concerns related to gambling or financially profitable criminal conduct. After\nconsideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 41-year-old warehouse specialist who has worked for a defense\ncontractor since August 2007 (Item 4). The available record does not show that she has\never held a security clearance.\nApplicant was married from March 1987 to September 1994. She has three\nchildren, a son born in December 1984, and daughters born in July 1987 and April\n1990. She raised her children on her own until about 2003 when her youngest daughter\nwent to live with her ex-husband.  Applicant began paying child support (Ex. E).  None\n1\n2\nof her children was living with her as of August 2007 (Item 4).\n\nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.bb that Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition was discharged on or about\n3\nOctober 23, 2001. It is not clear where the government obtained that information. The credit reports available\nfor review indicate a disposition date of January 2002.\n3\nApplicant attended a community college from about August 1988 to August 1992\nbut did not earn a degree. She took out student loans to pay for college totaling about\n$19,438 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) that she did not repay (Items 4, 5).  As of July 2007, her student\nloan debt was in collection with a balance of $22,211 (Item 5).\nFrom March 1996 to July 2005, Applicant was employed by a nationwide\ndiscount retailer as a department manager in one of its stores (Item 4). She struggled\nfinancially and cashed in her employee stocks and took out signature loans to pay for\ncar repairs (Ex. E). In September 2001 she sought to relieve herself of her obligation to\nto repay some debts by filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. She was granted a discharge of\nlegally dischargeable debts in January 2002 (Items 5, 6).  What little can be discerned\n3\nfrom the available record about the extent or nature of the debt included in the\nbankruptcy is that some credit card debts and a secured loan were covered.\nApplicant, who earned gross income of $24,000 in 2002 and $27,000 in 2003,\nincurred legal costs in fighting her ex-husband over custody of their daughter. She took\nout several installment loans to pay legal fees and her child support, and eventually had\nto take new loans to cover payments on the old ones (Ex. A). In August 2001, Applicant\ntook out loans of $914 and $679 from the same lender at two different locations. In\nNovember 2003, Applicant took out two more loans of $292 and $619 from the\ncompany. All of the accounts were charged off: the $914 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) in June 2006, the\n$679 in January 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.r), and the $292 (SOR \u00b6 1.j) and $619 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) in\nJanuary 2004. Yet another installment loan, taken out for $416 back in August 2001,\nwas charged off with a balance owed of $347 (SOR \u00b6 1.aa). In October 2003, a $764\ndelinquent installment loan balance with another finance company was sent for\ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.n). In February 2004 three creditors obtained judgments against her\nin the amounts of $603 (SOR \u00b6 1.o), $711 (SOR \u00b6 1.s), and $720 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Four\ninstallment loan accounts with yet another lender became delinquent. In March 2004,\nthe company obtained two judgments against her in the amounts of $459 (SOR \u00b6 1.l)\nand $321 (SOR \u00b6 1.m). Two other debts owed the creditor  of $560 (SOR \u00b6 1.p) and\n$914 (SOR \u00b6 1.q) were charged off. In November 2004, two more delinquent loans of\n$228 and $283 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y and 1.z) were charged off (Items 5, 6).\nAs of February 2004, Applicant owed a bank $142 for a returned check (SOR \u00b6\n1.t). In June 2004, an unpaid medical debt of $37 was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.f).\nIn 2005, Applicant incurred dental charges of $116, $215, and $231 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u, 1.v,\nand 1.w) that were referred for collection in about August 2007. Applicant also fell\nbehind in her utility and phone services accounts. In April 2006, a natural gas debt of\n$155 owed since December 2003 was referred for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e). A wireless\ntelephone services debt of $2,373 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was placed for collection in May 2006\nafter there had been no activity on the account since December 2003. In October 2006,\na $47 delinquent electric services debt was referred for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In March\n\nThe government alleged that Applicant had four delinquent accounts with this creditor totaling $2,657 (SOR\n4\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, 1.p, and 1.q). Applicant listed two loans with the creditor on her Schedule F with claims of $322\nand $0. The $322 is likely the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m as the company obtained a judgment amount against her\nin March 2004 in that approximate amount. That account had a high credit of $292. Another branch of the loan\ncompany had obtained a judgment of $459. It is likely the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. Based on the credit\nreports, the government also alleged charged off debt balances of $$640 and $994 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.q). Her\ncredit report of March 5, 2008 (Item 6) includes all four debts.\n4\n2007, a second wireless services debt of $2,373 was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d).\nAs of August 2007, she owed another $67 collection balance for services on a utility\nservices account opened in May 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). In March 2007, a mail-order DVD\nsupplier placed a $120 debt balance for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.x). (Items 5, 6).\nIn March 2004, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13. On her petition,\nshe indicated that she had not filed a prior bankruptcy within the last six years, although\nshe does not now deny, and the credit reports (Items 5, 6, Ex. B) confirm the Chapter 7\nfiling in September 2001. In her Chapter 13 petition, Applicant listed liabilities totaling\n$52,253.91 of which $40,613.87 was for unsecured claims. The $11,640.04 in secured\nclaims was for an automobile (not alleged). The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d\u20131.j, 1.m\u20131.n, and\n1.t were listed on her petition. Also on the bankruptcy were several debts not alleged in\nthe SOR, including loans totaling over $2,500, $8,600 for a repossessed car, $849 in\ncredit card debt, two collection debts totaling $670, and $1,500 in legal services for the\ncustody battle. Applicant proposed to pay $14,234.44 (the $11,640 secured auto loan\ndebt and $1,300 in attorney fees) under the plan (Ex. C). Some of her creditors filed\nclaims with the bankruptcy trustee. Her total wireless phone debt listed at $3,321 went\nto $4,145. The lender in SOR \u00b6 1.m added a second claim of $796.80.  A settlement\n4\ncorporation claimed a $4,081.19 debt (not alleged) that was not listed on her bankruptcy\npetition. The lender in SOR \u00b6 1,n filed a claim for $864.65 when Applicant had listed the\namount of the claim as \u201cunknown\u201d on her Schedule F. These claims were allowed by\nthe trustee in August 2004 for purposes of distribution under the plan unless Applicant\nor other interested party filed objections to the claims. There is no evidence Applicant\nobjected to the filed claims totaling $47,791.11 (Ex. A).\nApplicant paid $15,257 under the bankruptcy plan between April 27, 2004, and\nJune 17, 2005. In addition to monthly payments of $395.40 by money order, she turned\nover an $8,110 check for her truck (Item 4, Ex. E) and a $1,216 tax refund to the\nbankruptcy trustee (Ex. D). As of February 28, 2005, the trustee had paid her attorney\u2019s\nfee of $1,300, the trustee\u2019s fee of $643.64, and $11,369.76 of the secured claims. No\ndisbursements had been made as to the other claims allowed in the bankruptcy (Ex. D).\nApplicant provided no proof of any payments made under the plan after June 2005. In\nMarch 2006, her Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed (Items 5, 6).\nIn August 2007, Applicant started working as a warehouse specialist for her\ncurrent employer. Needing a clearance for her duties on a military installation, Applicant\nexecuted an e-QIP on August 23, 2007. She listed her March 2004 Chapter 13\nbankruptcy filing in response to question 27.a \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you filed a\npetition under any chapter of the bankruptcy code (to include chapter 13)?\u201d and\n\n5\nexplained, \u201cI was to pay a certain amount each month. The amount was lessoned [sic]\ndue to a check I recieved [sic] from my truck for over $8000 that I gave to the courts to\npay off early.\u201d Applicant responded \u201cYes\u201d as well to questions 28.a (over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debts in last 7 years) and 28.b (currently over 90 days delinquent on\nany debts), and listed her student loan debt that she estimated at $24,000, and added:\nThe amount is an estimate. I am not sure how much I owe. I have not\nrecieved [sic] any information for me to restart payment of my student loan\nsince the ending of my bankruptcy. I am also not sure at the moment who\nhas my student loan since it goes through many different companies as\nthey refigure it. (Item 4).\nAs of September 11, 2007, the credit bureaus were reporting the dismissal of her\nMarch 2004 Chapter 13 bankruptcy and several debts placed for collection thereafter,\nincluding the wireless phone services debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, the medical debts in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u\u20131.w, the utility accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and the DVD debt in SOR\n\u00b6 1.x (Item 5). A subsequent check of Applicant\u2019s credit on March 5, 2008, revealed no\nprogress toward resolving those debts in active collection status as well as an\noutstanding child support balance of $1,132.  Some of the loan companies who had\nfiled claims against her in the bankruptcy were reporting balances owed after charge off\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h\u20131.n) and her student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g) was past due in the amount of\n$22,842 (Item 6, Ex. B). As of April 2008, she was paying her child support under\nagreed upon terms but she owed a balance of $1,166. Her medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.u\u20131.w were past due in the aggregate $728 and her student loan debt had risen to\n$22,914 (Ex. B). Applicant satisfied the $67 utility services debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a on April 8,\n2008 (Item 3).\nApplicant denies that she knowingly incurred any delinquent debt since 2005. As\nfor the medical bills, she indicated she thought insurance had paid them and it was not\nuntil she received the FORM that she realized the bills were for her tooth. When she\nresponded to the FORM in May 2008, she also promised to pay the gas services debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.b by the end the month. She retains only one active credit card, issued by a\ndepartment store, to rebuild her credit. The account was 60 days past due as of October\n2005, but she brought it current. She has run a balance from a low of $290 to a high of\n$455 on the account since May 2006. As of April 2008, that account had a $360\nbalance. Applicant claims to have no knowledge of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.x, and it does\nnot appear on her latest credit report (Ex. B, Ex. E).  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n6\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\nApplicant claims to not recognize the debt, but it appears on her September 2007 credit report (Item 5) as\n5\na collection account. She has not provided any documentation to substantiate a dispute over its legitimacy.\n7\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nAfforded some relief after a Chapter 7 discharge in January 2002, Applicant\nremained legally responsible for about $20,000 in delinquent student loan debt (SOR \u00b6\n1.g). In about 2003, she began taking on new installment loan debt to pay other\nobligations. By March 2004, she had incurred liabilities of more than $52,000, including\nabout $4,145 in wireless phone services debt. Significant security concerns are raised\nby \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nApplicant attributes her indebtedness to the struggles of caring for her three\nchildren without any child support. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies in part. While\nshe did not provide specific economic data, her income as a department store manager\nwas likely insufficient to cover all the expenses of raising three children and it explains\nthe first bankruptcy. Her more recent debt includes sizeable cellular phone costs that\nhave not been shown to fall within AG \u00b6 20(b), even if I excuse that portion of\ninstallment loan debt taken out to pay for costs associated with her custody battle over\nher daughter. Applicant also has not acted responsibly with regard to her student loan\nobligations.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are too pervasive and too recent to satisfy\nmitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d). Credit checks\nrun since September 2007 confirm that several of the debts alleged in the SOR\noriginally came due in or before 2004. While she made some effort to address this debt\nthrough a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, she continued to incur new debt. Three medical debts\ntotaling $562 incurred in August 2005 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u-1.w) were placed for collection in\nAugust 2007. Utility services debts of $67 and $47 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) were sent for\ncollection in 2006. A $120 DVD debt (SOR \u00b6 1.x) was referred for collection in March\n2007. Even assuming Applicant has a good-faith basis to dispute the DVD debt,  which\n5\ndoes not appear on her May 2008 credit report (Ex. B), she had a responsibility to\nfollow-up on the other debts that she claimed she thought had been paid or covered by\ninsurance. Applicant has made no payments on her defaulted student loans, which  total\nabout $22,914 as of April 2008. She satisfied the $67 utility services debt, albeit not until\nApril 2008, but has paid nothing toward her medical debts.\n\nIt is also unclear whether Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose her 2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy on her Chapter 13\n6\npetition had a role in the dismissal of her March 2004 case.\n8\nApplicant\u2019s March 2004 Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing and subsequent payments\ntotaling $15,257 under the plan constitute a good-faith effort to resolve her debts under\nAG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u201d). However, there is no indication of any payment by her under\nthe plan after June 2005, and the bankruptcy was dismissed in March 2006 leaving\nseveral debts unpaid, including cellular telephone debt of $4,578 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d) and\ninstallment loan debt of $4,340 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.k, 1.n, 1.o) listed as past due on her May\n2008 credit report. The failure of creditors to actively pursue collection (Ex.. E) lessens\nher financial pressures, but it does not mitigate the judgment concerns raised by her\nfinancial mismanagement. It is unclear why Applicant stopped her payments under the\nChapter 13. While the $15,257 paid in the plan exceeded the $14,234.44 (the secured\ndebt and attorney fees) she proposed to pay under the plan, claims were subsequently\nfiled against her, and allowed by the trustee, well in excess of what she paid.6\nApplicant is no longer borrowing from one creditor to pay off another. This is a\nfavorable change in her financial habits, but it is premature to conclude that \u201cthere are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d (see AG \u00b6 20(c).\nAs of April 2008, her delinquent student loan balance was about $22,914. She averred\nshe had contacted the lender to set up payments (Item 3). Repayment terms had not\nbeen arranged as of mid-May 2008. Applicant has not provided evidence showing she\nwill be able to satisfy that debt in the reasonably foreseeable future. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n\n9\nI considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. The government must be assured that those\npersons with classified access can be counted on to exercise good judgment at all\ntimes. Applicant\u2019s student loans were not discharged in her Chapter 7 bankruptcy but\nshe was relieved of her legal responsibility to pay other obligations. She continued to\nmake poor financial decisions, and incurred more than $20,000 in unsecured debt in\naddition to the student loans that were in default. Her efforts to resolve that debt through\na Chapter 13 bankruptcy fall short of overcoming the concerns for her financial\njudgment in light of her failure to see the plan through to a discharge of her debts. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.aa:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.bb:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.cc:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not  clearly consistent with national security\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nNovember 20, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 26,\n2006. On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F  for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on July 7, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on September\n4, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 30, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on October 23, 2008, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Government\noffered Exhibits1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified\non his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A and B, which were also admitted without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on October 31, 2008. I\n\n2\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until October 30, 2008, to submit\nadditional documents. He timely submitted a cover letter and five character letters,\nwhich have been marked and entered into evidence without objection as Exhibit C.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The admitted\nallegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 27 years old. He is married and he has one daughter. He is a high\nschool graduate with several years of college.\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 12 allegations (1.a. through 1.l.) regarding financial difficulties of\noverdue debts under Adjudicative Guideline F, with the overdue debts.  In his RSOR,\nApplicant admitted that this allegation is correct, and at the hearing, Applicant testified\nthat none of the debts have been paid, except 1.g., but he is working with a credit\ncounseling service (ccs) to resolve the debts. All of the allegations will be discussed in\nthe same order as they were listed in the SOR, and then his effort to resolve the debts\nwill be reviewed:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $857,\nand this debt is still unpaid. Exhibit A includes a letter from the ccs with whom Applicant\nis working, which indicates that they have been unable to verify this debt so they can\nnot make arrangements to pay off this debt. They indicated that because of this they\nwould be disputing this bill for possible deletion from Applicant\u2019s credit report. His work\nwith the ccs will be discussed below. \n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $704,\nand this debt is still unpaid.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $60, and\nthis debt is still unpaid. The letter from the ccs also indicates that initially they had been\nunable to verify this debt so they could not make arrangements to pay off this debt.\nHowever, they subsequently received a deletion letter from the last creditor for this debt,\nso this debt has been resolved (Exhibit A). \n\n3\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $463,\nand this debt is still unpaid. \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,473,\nand this debt is still unpaid.  \n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $12,048,\nand this debt is still unpaid. The letter from the ccs also indicates that the creditor is\nwilling to accept $8,000 to settle this debt, and they are going to attempt to resolve this\ndebt (Exhibit A).\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $140. At\nthe hearing, Applicant testified that this debt has been paid through the ccs with which\nhe has been working. Exhibit A establishes that this debt has been paid. \n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $697,\nand this debt is still unpaid.\n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,305,\nand this debt is still unpaid.\n1.J. This overdue debt to Creditor 10 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,123,\nand this debt is still unpaid.\n1.k. This overdue debt to Creditor 11 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $562.\nExhibit A indicates that this debt will be removed from Applicant\u2019s credit history,\nbecause it is for a two year contract, signed on March 8, 2006 for a health club\nmembership. It is not clear why they believe that it will be dropped.\n1.l. This overdue debt to Creditor 12 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $501,\nand this debt is still unpaid.\nApplicant testified that he has been paying $100 a month to a ccs since June\n2008, and thus far he has paid $800, and will pay $1,500 to them to help him resolve his\ndebts.  Exhibit A is a letter from this ccs, confirming that they are a \u201cLicensed, Bonded\nand Registered Credit Service Organization\u201d and that Applicant is currently a client. An\nadditional letter from this ccs indicates that they are contacting and verifying the\namounts owed by Applicant and attempting to make arrangements for payoffs to satisfy\nhis debts. As discussed above some of these debt have been resolved by this ccs, and\nin their letter they indicate that they are waiting to hear back from other creditors to\nattempt to resolve the other outstanding debts. Applicant testified that he had contacted\nanother ccs before, but they really did not do much to help him resolve his debts. The\nservice he is now using was recommended to him by a friend.  \n\n4\nApplicant testified that his financial difficulties primarily began when his current\nwife, who was his fiancee at the time, became pregnant and received healthcare for\nwhich her insurance did not adequately compensate her, resulting in unpaid hospital\nand doctor bills. Additionally, she was unable to work for the last months of her\npregnancy. Applicant confirmed that before his wife\u2019s pregnancy, he had been current\non his bills. He estimated that since 2005 he has been able to stabilize his finances,  so\nwhile he has not resolves his past overdue debts, he has not incurred any new overdue\ndebts. \nApplicant, his wife, and his daughter recently moved into an apartment with his\nmother and sister so he could reduce his overhead and attempt to resolve his debts\nsooner. \nApplicant testified that in he is current on all of his recent debts, and that he and\nhis wife have a system so that they can remain current on all of their debts each month.\nHe also testified very credibly that Applicant and his wife are extremely motivated to\nresolve all of their overdue debts so that they can build a better life for the family.\nFinally, Applicant submitted five character letters (Exhibit C), one from his father-\nin-law and four from different levels of supervisors at Applicant\u2019s employer. All of them\nwere extremely laudatory. His direct supervisor described Applicant as \u201dhelpful, reliable\nand a great team player,\u201d and his foreman wrote, \u201cAt all times, I have found [Applicant]\nto be dependable, organized, competent, hard-working, conscientious, honest and\ncourteous with great integrity.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n5\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has\nbeen unable to pay the majority of his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\n\n6\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, the\nfinancial problems arose primarily from Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s pregnancy, both because of\nthe medical bills without sufficient health insurance, plus her inability to work because\nhe health was impaired during the latter part of her pregnancy. Prior to this incident,\nApplicant did not have overdue debts.  Additionally, while it might have been delayed,  I\ncan conclude that Applicant has now acted responsibly under these circumstances by\nengaging the services of a company by paying it $800 so far, that appears to be\nseriously involved in helping him resolve these overdue debts. Therefore, I find that this\nmitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case. \n While Applicant has not resolved the great majority of his overdue debt. I\nconclude he is responsibly pursuing a course to reduce this debt, and he has mitigated\nthe financial concerns of the Government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why Mitigating Condition (b) applies, and considering the exceptionally\npositive character letters in evidence, I find that the record evidence leaves me with no\nsignificant  questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas mitigated the security concerns. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.l.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On August 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \nApril 28, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on an unspecified date. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, dated October 13, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations \nand requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated \nthe Government was prepared to proceed on February 5, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to me on February 6, 2009. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 5, 2009, \nand I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 25, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, four Government exhibits and eight Applicant exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) was received on April 2, 2009. \n \nThe record was kept open until April 6, 2009, to enable the parties to supplement \nthe record.  Department Counsel chose not to make any further submissions, but \nApplicant took advantage of that opportunity and, on that date, submitted two additional \ndocuments (marked as Applicant Exhibits I and J) which were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a majority of the factual allegations \nin the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). He denied the one remaining allegation. \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nretain a SECRET security clearance. He has held a variety of security clearances, \nincluding SECRET and TOP SECRET, since about March 1967.1 His marriage to his \nfirst wife ended with her accidental death in 1979.2 He and his current wife have been \nmarried nearly 30 years, and they have seven living children.3 He served on active duty \nwith the U.S. Army from 1967 through 1970, and was assigned to communications \nsupport at the White House.4 Applicant has been gainfully employed by the same \n \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP, dated October 1, 2007), at 38-40. \n \n2 Id. at 16-17. Applicant\u2019s wife and two children were killed when struck by an automobile. \n \n3 Tr. at 31.  \n \n4 Id. at 103-04. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nactivities. \n                                                          \ndefense contractor since April 1997, and currently serves as a Senior Principal Software \nEngineer.5 He is also the founder/president/investor of a duly chartered corporation \nholding exclusive rights to certain intellectual property.6  \n \nIn 1997, in conjunction with his new employment, Applicant relocated his family \nand household from one state to another, putting his old house on the market and \nrenting at his new location.7  Because of the financial strain of not selling his residence \nfor about one year, he started to fall behind in routine payments. One creditor sued him \nand obtained a judgment, causing additional financial strain.8 In April 1999, upon the \nadvice of an attorney, Applicant sought relief and filed for voluntary bankruptcy under \nChapter 7.9 In August 1999, with assets of only $10,870, Applicant\u2019s liabilities of \n$59,165 were discharged.10 Although he has not subsequently affirmed any of his \ndischarged debts, Applicant felt remorse over the bankruptcy and hopes to pay back \nthose creditors when he is able to do so.11 \n \n Following his bankruptcy, Applicant created spreadsheets and paid close \nattention to his finances.12 Additionally, because of early successes involving his part-\ntime technology development activities, in August 2007, he established two corporations \nto formalize those business activities.13 His objective was to \u201cprovide an avenue of \nwork\u201d when he retires in 2014.14 The two corporations obtained financing from \ninvestors, including Applicant, and conducted legitimate business \n \nApplicant established an account with one creditor, in his own name, but in \nreality, it was a business account. The creditor\u2019s product was used for testing his \ncorporate products.15 Periodic payments, totaling about $3,000, were routinely made \nuntil early 2008, when they ceased.16 In May 2008, the account, with an outstanding \n \n5 Applicant Exhibit F (Leave and Earnings Statement, dated March 12, 2009). \n \n6 Applicant Exhibit D (Letters of Reference, dated March 17-18, 2009); See also Applicant Exhibit E \n(Corporate Charters, dated August 2, 2007 and August 15, 2007). \n \n7 Tr. at 33. \n \n8 Id. \n \n9 Id. at 34; See also SOR & 1.a. \n \n10 Government Exhibit 3 (Bankruptcy Record [LexisNexis web search, dated August 8, 2008]), at 1. \n \n11 Tr. at 34. \n \n12 Id. at 35. \n \n13 Government Exhibit 2 (Interrogatories and Answers to Interrogatories, dated May 19, 2008), at 4. \n \n14 Id. \n \n15 Tr. at 36. \n \n16 Id. at 37. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nbalance of $1,039, was sent to collection.17 On March 23, 2009, following negotiations \nwith the creditor, Applicant was offered a settlement opportunity.18 The following day, he \npaid the creditor $870, and the account was considered \u201csettled in full.\u201d19  \n \nIn about 2003, prior to the onset of his most recent financial difficulties, Applicant \nopened a credit card account and used it for normal personal expenses.20 He \nmaintained the account in a current status until sometime in 2007.21 However, the \nfinancial demands of his family, described further below, and his growing business \nbecame overwhelming and he was unable to continue making timely payments.22 As a \nresult, the account was closed by the creditor, placed for collection, and eventually \ncharged off in July 2008.23 The unpaid balance at that time was $2,973.24 In May 2008, \nApplicant had made a $416 payment.25 Despite the account having been charged off, in \nNovember 2008, the creditor obtained a $3,067.85 judgment against Applicant.26 \nApplicant made a $1,000 payment in December 2008.27 On March 4, 2009, Applicant \nwas offered a discounted settlement offer, and he accepted it.28 On March 24, 2009, he \npaid the agreed balance of $2,168,29 and the account was \u201csettled in full.\u201d30 \n \nApplicant opened a credit card account with Visa in 2004, and used it for normal \npersonal expenses.31 He maintained the account in a current status until sometime in \n2007.32 As with his other accounts, his financial condition made it difficult to continue \n \n17 Government Exhibit 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated July 17, 2008), at 1; See also SOR & 1.b. \n \n18 Applicant Exhibit A (Creditor Settlement Opportunity Letter, dated March 23, 2009), at 1. \n \n19 Id.

According to his most recent Personal Financial Statement, completed in \nMay 2008, Applicant had a monthly sum of $340 for discretionary expenses.60 That \namount should have increased now that he has paid off the one debt listed as a monthly \npayment. He currently earns a biweekly $5,192.61 Applicant\u2019s corporations owe him \napproximately $280,000 in back wages and reimbursable expenses, which he expects \nto start drawing once an anticipated contract with an investor is signed in April 2009.62 \n \nThe financial demands of Applicant\u2019s growing business have been a factor in his \nfinancial difficulties, but also prominent was the issue of the demands of Applicant\u2019s \nfamily. One 24-year-old unemployed son has resided with Applicant since April 2007; a \n28-year-old son, whose wife deserted him, has resided with his three young children, in \nApplicant\u2019s residence since March 2008; a 22-year-old daughter and her unemployed \nhusband rely on Applicant for financial assistance; and his 73-year-old mother-in-law \nhas resided with Applicant since December 2007. Some of them contribute money.63 \nDespite his financial problems, Applicant\u2019s work performance has apparently not \nsuffered for he recently earned a bonus of $5,091.51.64 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d65 As Commander in Chief, \nthe President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national \nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access \nto such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his \ndesignee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a \nfinding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d66   \n \n \n60 Government Exhibit 2 (Personal Financial Statement, dated May 18, 2008, attached to Interrogatories), \nsupra note 13. \n \n61 Applicant Exhibit F, supra note 5. \n \n62 Tr. at 50-52. \n \n63 Applicant Exhibit G (Family Support Statement, undated). \n \n64 Applicant Exhibit F, supra note 5. \n \n65 Department of the Navy v.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d67 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.68  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation.  Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d69 \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d70 Thus, nothing \n \n67 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd.

It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit \nreports, answer to the SOR, his answers to interrogatories, and the evidence, including \nhis testimony, presented during the hearing. The Government has established AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c).   \n \nThe guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying \ncondition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ \nIn addition, when \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b) may apply. Evidence that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially mitigating \nunder AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \ndebts.@71 Also, AG & 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue\u201d may apply. \n \nAs noted above, the normal overriding concern pertaining to financial \nconsiderations in the security clearance context is that \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. . . .\u201d \n(emphasis supplied).  But these are not \u201cnormal\u201d times, for the world in general, and the \nUnited States in particular, is faced with economic chaos, plummeting real estate \nvalues, tightened credit, corporate layoffs and bankruptcies, diminished savings and \nretirement accounts, financial institution failures and takeovers, and soaring \nunemployment.  \n   \nWe no longer think in terms of millions or even billions of dollars when describing \nthe U.S. national debt, for in this new world order, trillions of dollars have become the \nnew standard.  We are in economic turmoil, with posturing and corporate greed \nbecoming increasingly common; where credit is largely unavailable; where thousands, if \nnot hundreds of thousands, of otherwise innocent bystanders have lost their homes to \nforeclosure and their jobs to these uncertain times; and where the popular responses \nare to point the fingers of blame and invest unprecedented amounts of money to restart \nthe economy and reverse the recession.  \n   \nThis economic catastrophe appears to be the \u201cperfect storm\u201d where the \nconfluence of greed, irresponsible risk-taking, regulatory failure and inadequate \noversight, malfeasance, misfeasance, and nonfeasance on the part of some segments \nof corporate America, our financial institutions, some creditors, and political institutions, \nhave resulted in unintentional consequences or \u201ccollateral damage\u201d to the innocents \u2013 \nmillions of Americans, especially the American taxpayer.  In the past, these \nunconscionable actions were overlooked in the race for enrichment.   \n   \n \n71 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nTo determine if an applicant is such an unintentional victim or a willing participant \nand complicit, in an otherwise unwise or irresponsible monetary scheme, or a person \nwith poor self-control or lack of judgment, an analysis of the individual\u2019s original \nintentions and actions is essential. In this instance, since his 1999 bankruptcy, \nApplicant\u2019s financial history and actions reveal no evidence of poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. To the contrary, his \ngoals were to insure the success of his corporation; to protect his family; and pay his \ncreditors. He originally obtained a mortgage with an affordable monthly payment, and \nwhen the mortgage payments adjusted upward, he set out to sell the residence. This \nsame strategy was employed by thousands of Americans. His efforts were responsible \nand disciplined. Applicant\u2019s current situation was caused by other factors, including a \npossible error by his mortgage lender.  \n   \nIn January 2007, Applicant\u2019s family relocated to a rental home near his \ncorporations so they could perform necessary work for those corporations. He remained \nat home during the workweek, near his employer, commuting to the new family \nresidence on weekends. Unable to handle two house payments, in about June 2007, he \nstopped making his mortgage payments, and in November 2007, the property was \nforeclosed and scheduled to be sold in February 2009 at a trustee\u2019s sale. Since that \nprojected foreclosure sale, Applicant has received no deficiency notices, and there is no \nevidence of a deficiency. This situation presents an interesting conundrum, for after the \nforeclosure, the sale ensued, under state law, Applicant may not be liable for either the \nunpaid mortgage or the deficiency, if there was one, and the lien holder would be limited \nto the property. Under Arizona law, there is a provision called the Anti-Deficiency \nStatute,72 which states in relevant part: \n \nIf trust property of two and one-half acres or less which is limited to and \nutilized for either a single one-family or a single two-family dwelling is sold \npursuant to the trustee's power of sale, no action may be maintained to \nrecover any difference between the amount obtained by sale and the \namount of the indebtedness and any interest, costs and expenses.   \n \nConsidering the unusual circumstances of today\u2019s economy in general, and the \nseries of events involving Applicant\u2019s mortgage loan and subsequent inability to sell his \nresidence, in particular, Applicant\u2019s actions and his otherwise generally average, \nunremarkable, financial status, there are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial \nissues have been resolved and are now largely under control. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(e) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively, timely, and responsibly to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. Those delinquent debts were \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under \n \n72 Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 33-814 (G) (2001); See also, Baker v. Gardner, 160 Ariz. 98, 770 P.2d 766 (Ariz. 1988). \nArizona\u2019s anti-deficiency statutes prohibit a secured lender from suing a homeowner who borrowed money on those \ntypes of loans protected by the anti-deficiency statutes for damages beyond recovery of the secured property. \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nthe Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence.73 Applicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) \nbecause his financial problems \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d Applicant attempted to balance the needs of family and business with \nthose of timely payment of creditors, and he was, at least for a time, unsuccessful. He \nhas now paid off two creditors and commenced payments to a third. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies \nbecause he disputed one of the SOR debts and there is no evidence of a continuing \ndeficiency obligation. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies because Applicant\u2019s financial situation was exacerbated by \nthe downward spiral of the global economy; his inability to sell his residence because of \nan unexpectedly poor housing market; the desertion of his son and grandchildren by his \ndaughter-in-law; the needs of his growing business; one of the debts was business-\nrelated; and the lack of employment experienced by two sons. Initially, he lacked the \nincome to keep his business afloat, his family secure, and pay some of his debts, but he \neventually commenced negotiations with creditors and started paying his SOR debts. \nWhile it may have taken some time, Applicant eventually established that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances.74  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies because he started addressing those delinquencies when he \nreceived his annual bonus.  There are now \u201cclear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control.\u201d He understands the security implications of his earlier \ninaction pertaining to delinquent debt and intends to scrupulously avoid future \ndelinquent debt. \n \nHe has also established mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because Applicant showed \ngood faith in his efforts to resolve his SOR debts.  He has established a reasonable plan \nto continue to do so, and has already taken care of all but one of them, and that one is \ncurrently being addressed under an agreement with the creditor.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n \n73 See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. \nOct. 16, 2002)). \n \n74 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his \n[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when \ndealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)).  \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my analysis below.      \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. As noted above, \npart of his financial difficulties arose from diverting assets to his business. Applicant also \napparently ignored his debts, and, as a result, several accounts became delinquent and \nwere either \u201ccharged off\u201d or placed for collection.  \n The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant attempted to balance the needs of family and business with those of timely \npayment of creditors, and he was, at least for a time, unsuccessful. When he had \nsufficient money to do both, he directed his efforts to paying off his delinquent debts. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation, and to the contrary, he is apparently \nconsidered a valued employee, justifying a substantial bonus. He is a law-abiding \ncitizen. He intends to satisfy the one remaining debt in the near future. His personal \npayment plan is in place and being followed, and he has no new delinquent debts. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:75 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c . . . established a plan to \nresolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u201d The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of \nan applicant\u2019s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the \nextent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \n \n75 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable \ndebt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nApplicant made mistakes, and debts became delinquent. There is, however, \nsimply no reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has established a \u201cmeaningful track \nrecord\u201d of debt payments by actually paying most of his delinquent SOR debts, setting \nup arrangements with the one remaining creditor, and setting up his personal plan to \nresolve that remaining debt. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and \nmitigation. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nChief Administrative Judge \n",

Michael Lyles, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJanuary 27, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn August 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 28, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 22, 2008. Applicant filed a\nresponse to the FORM on November 4, 2008. The case was assigned to me on\nNovember 18, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant is indebted to RADIO/SAMDC in the approximate amount of $2,244.00.\nThis debt was charged off. In his response to the SOR, applicant stated he spoke with a\ncustomer service representative who told him to call them back when he could repay\nthe entire debt. In his response to the FORM, he stated the debt has been transferred to\nIGT Collection and despite several attempts, he has not been able to speak with anyone\nat IGT.\nApplicant was indebted to CingularPR on an account that had been charged off\nin the amount of $50.00. He satisfied the debt in August 2008.\nApplicant was indebted to PALISADES on a collection account that originated\nwith Wells Fargo in the approximate amount of $6,033.00. In his response to the SOR,\napplicant stated he reached an agreement with the creditor in August 2008 to make \u201ca\ndown payment of $450.00 and to pay $150.00 monthly until the bill is satisfied.\u201d He\nattached documents to his response to the FORM that indicate he made an initial\n$400.00 payment in August 2008, and then made $150.00 payments in September and\nOctober 2008.\nApplicant was indebted to LVNV FUNDING on an account that had been turned\nover for collection in the approximate amount of $378.00. He satisfied the debt in\nAugust 2008.\nApplicant is indebted to BCO Bilbao in the approximate amount of $9,310.00. In\nhis response to the SOR, applicant stated he had \u201ca vehicle from BCO Bilbao\u201d  and\nwhen he lost his job he notified them and voluntarily surrendered the car. He further\nstated to his knowledge, \u201cthe vehicle was supposed to be auctioned off to satisfy his\ndebt.\u201d In his response to the FORM, he stated he spoke with the repossession\ndepartment of the company that actually picked up his vehicle and was told the vehicle\nhad been sold, the amount owed was no longer correct, and that the company could not\ngive him any further information over the phone. He further stated that he has started\nthe process of acquiring the information through the mail.\nApplicant is indebted to M. Berrios in the approximate amount of $999.00. This\ndebt has been charged off. In his responses to the SOR and FORM, applicant stated he\nspoke to the creditor and was told they will only accept payment in full. He then added,\n\u201cI am already making arrangements to comply with [the creditor\u2019s] payment policies.\u201d\nApplicant was indebted to International Home Products in the approximate\namount of $1,025.00. The account was delinquent. Applicant satisfied the debt in\nAugust 2008.\nApplicant is indebted to MOVISTAR on an account that has been turned over for\ncollection in the approximate amount of $481.00.\n\nAlthough applicant attached to his SOR response what appears to be a social security statement showing\n1\nno income in 2004 and 2005, this information conflicts with his employment history he reported on his\nsecurity questionnaire in May 2007 (Exhibit 1). In Exhibit 1, he stated he was employed as a vice-\npresident of an auto-related company from 1994 to approximately March 2005, and was self employed as\nthe owner of a caf\u00e9 from approximately March 2005 to 2007.\n3\nApplicant was indebted to AT&T on an account that had been turned over for\ncollection to Palisades in the approximate amount of $257.00. This debt was satisfied in\nOctober 2008. \nApplicant was indebted to Sprint in the approximate amount of $635.00. This\ndebt had been turned over for collection. Applicant satisfied the debt in October 2008.\nApplicant is indebted to Discover Financial in the approximate amount of\n$3,886.00. In response to the SOR, he stated he called the creditor and was \u201cnotified\nthat this account was deleted from their file system.\u201d He attached a note from either\nDiscover or their collection agency to his response to the FORM confirming that\napplicant authorized $50.00 to be taken out of his checking account on October 23,\n2008  and applied to his Discover debt.\nIn his response to the SOR, applicant stated, among other things, that his\nfinancial problems started when he was injured on the job and began receiving workers\ncompensation benefits in 2003. He added that he was also unemployed in 2004 and\n2005, although he didn\u2019t make clear if his unemployment was related to his injury.  \n1\nIn April 2008, applicant provided DOHA with a March 2008 bank statement\nindicating he has a total of about $25,000.00 in three separate accounts with one bank.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\n\n4\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of conduct\nindicating an inability or unwillingness to pay his debts.  Accordingly, these disqualifying\nconditions are applicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are\nrecent and ongoing. The evidence he offered is insufficient to establish he is not likely to\nexperience further financial delinquencies. This mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\nstates his financial problems were caused by a work-related injury and a subsequent\n\n5\nlengthy period of unemployment. The injury was beyond his control. However, even if\nhe were considered unemployed in 2004 and 2005 notwithstanding the contrary\nevidence in his security questionnaire, because he provided no explanation for the\nunemployment, I cannot conclude his unemployment was beyond his control. And,\ngiven his failure to address his delinquent debts until August 2008, the evidence does\nnot support a finding he acted responsibly. This mitigating condition is not applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. The problem is not under control. This\nmitigating condition is not applicable.\nParagraph d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant has\nsatisfied some of his smaller debts, and appears to have begun to repay his large\nPALISADES debt. This is a factor in his favor. However, he did not take any action to\naddress these delinquent debts until he received the SOR, and many of them remain\nunpaid even though, according to the bank statement he sent to DOHA, applicant\nappears to have the funds to satisfy them. This does not constitute a good faith effort to\nrepay his debts. This mitigating condition is not applicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who fell\nbehind on numerous debts many years ago. Although some of his financial problems\nmay have been caused by his work injury, he has had years since the injury to address\nthese debts, but chose not to do so. Only after he received the SOR did he begin to\naddress his delinquencies. Although he has made some debt payments, most of his\nindebtedness remains outstanding, even though he appears to have the funds to repay\nall of the debts for which he remains legally liable. Applicant failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns arising from Guideline F.\n\n6\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h of the SOR alleging possession of bank accounts in Lebanon and Turkey. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is a 47-year-old person who was born in Beirut, Lebanon. He was married from 1992 to 1998, when he was divorced in the United States. He does not have any children. He became a naturalized United States citizen on September 10, 1996. He works for a defense contractor, and has since July 2003. He lists his occupation as linguist, and then on the Government interrogatories as a compliance manager. In 1990 he received a master\u2019s degree in business administration.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn September 25, 2003, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application \n(SF 86). He submitted a second SF-86 on December 29, 2004. On December 17, 2008, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)1. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 The Government moved to amend the SOR to substitute \u201cGuideline C\u201d in Paragraph 1 instead of \u201cGuideline B\u201d on \npage 9 of the File of Relevant Material. Yet the Government\u2019s entire discussion in the File of Relevant Material is \nbased on Guideline B conditions under the Directive.  Therefore, I consider this case under Guideline B only, and \nthe motion is denied. \nJune 8, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 15, 2009. He requested his \ncase be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \nOn March 23, 2009, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written \ncase.  A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) was provided to the \nApplicant. He was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the file on March 30, 2009.  \nApplicant did not file a response to the FORM within the 30 day time allowed that would \nhave expired on April 30, 2009.  I received the case assignment on May 15, 2009.2 \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nLebanon. (FORM at 3) The request and the attached documents are included in the \nrecord as a series of pages not numbered or lettered but in the FORM after Item 7. \nApplicant did not object to consideration of those exhibits. Hence, the facts \nadministratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the \nFindings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 15, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h of the SOR alleging possession of bank accounts in \nLebanon and Turkey. He also provided additional information to support his request for \neligibility for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old person who was born in Beirut, Lebanon.  He was \nmarried from 1992 to 1998, when he was divorced in the United States. He does not \nhave any children. He became a naturalized United States citizen on September 10, \n1996.  He works for a defense contractor, and has since July 2003.  He lists his \noccupation as linguist, and then on the Government interrogatories as a compliance \nmanager. In 1990 he received a master\u2019s degree in business administration. His two \nSF-86 documents show he worked from 1992 to 1995 as a food store manager, then \nwas a salesman, next a cashier at a gas station from July 1995 to November 1996, and \nthen an accountant at various companies from December 1996 to September 2003, \nwhen he went to work for his present employer.  He was unemployed from June to July \n1995, from November to December 1996, again from December 1999 to January 2001 \n \n2 The FORM refers to Item 4 as the security questionnaire (SF-86) dated September 13, 2007.  However, the SF-86 \nin Item 4 is dated September 25, 2003.  It is the same document in Item 5, but was signed again and dated on \nDecember 29, 2004. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nand finally from June to July 2003.  Applicant did not disclose when he immigrated to \nthe United States. (Items 4, 5)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Lebanon.  She is 83 years old.  His \nfather is deceased.  Applicant admitted he has a moral obligation to help his mother with \nher living expenses and medical costs.  (Items 3-6) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has two brothers and three sisters who are citizens \nand residents of Lebanon.  His SF-86 discloses three brothers and three sisters living in \nLebanon who are citizens of that country.  One of those brothers and his wife have dual \nFrench and Lebanese citizenship. Applicant has one brother who lives in the United \nStates and has dual citizenship with Lebanon.  Applicant does not consider himself a \ncitizen of Lebanon since becoming a U.S. citizen. (Items 3-6) \n \n \nApplicant obtained and retained a Lebanese passport from September 1998 to \nSeptember 2003, after he became a U.S. citizen.  He obtained the passport because it \nmade it easier to enter and exit Lebanon with it than using a U.S. passport.  Applicant \ntraveled to Lebanon from September to October 1998, from September to November \n1999, from February to May 2000, and from March to April 2008.  He traveled to Turkey \nfrom November to December 2006 using his U.S. passport. (Items 3-6)  \n \n \nApplicant opened a saving account in a Lebanese bank in October 1999.  This \naccount had $485,000 in it until it was closed in February 2009.  Applicant did not \npresent any evidence showing where he deposited or invested that money after he \nwithdrew it from the Lebanese bank.  Applicant opened another savings account in \nDecember 2006 in Turkey.  He used his U.S. passport to open that account.  It had \n$10,000 in it until he closed it on January 28, 2009.  He did not present any evidence \nshowing where he moved the money after withdrawing it from the Turkish bank.  \nApplicant does not have any real estate in the United States. He describes his net worth \nas amounting to $657,000. His SF-86 states an address in the United States as his \nhome of record, but it is a street number and name with a floor number, a city and a \nstate.  The SF-86 states he will live at or near his job location, which is in a separate \nstate from his some of record in the United States. Also, he has not declared any real \nestate he may own in any foreign country. (Items 3-6) \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: \n  \nLebanon \n \nLebanon is a parliamentary democracy in which people have the constitutional \nright to change their government. It has a unicameral legislature, and a president \nelected by the legislature.  Its major elected officials have been allocated among the \nvarious religious and ethnic groups for many years, according to the Constitution and a \nlong-ago negotiated agreement among all the parties.  Lebanon is located at the \neastern end of the Mediterranean Sea in the Middle East area. It operated under a \nFrench mandate between World War I and II.  It was peaceful until a civil war erupted in \n\n \n4 \n \n \n1978 between various religious factions. Due to this civil war the full exercise of political \nrights were precluded from 1978 until 1992. During the period 1992 to 2005, post-war \nreconstruction in Lebanon has included social and political instability, economic \nuncertainty, and problems with basic infrastructure, violent clashes between Israeli \nmilitary forces and Hezbollah, and political assassinations.  Political assassinations also \noccurred in 2006, 2007, and 2008.  \n \nLebanon has a free-market economy and a strong laissez-faire commercial \ntradition. Historically, the Lebanese have been traders throughout the Mediterranean. \nThe economy is service-oriented. The U.S. enjoys a strong exporter position with \nLebanon and is its fifth largest source of imported good. More than 160 offices \nrepresenting U.S. businesses operate in Lebanon. Since the lifting of passport \nrestrictions in 1997, a number of large U.S. companies have opened branch or regional \noffices in Lebanon.  \n \nThe foreign policy of Lebanon reflects its geographic location, the composition of \nits population and its reliance on commerce and trade. Its foreign policy is heavily \ninfluenced by neighboring Syria, which has also long influenced Lebanon\u2019s internal \npolicies as well. For over 10 years, Syrian troops occupied part of Lebanon, and \ncontrolled its internal politics and policies.  About three years ago, Syria was forced to \nwithdraw its troops because of Lebanese opposition expressed in a popular uprising \nagainst the Syrian presence.  Syria maintains some influence in Lebanon.  The U.S. \nState Department has declared Syria to be a supporter of terrorism. Lebanon, like most \nArab states, does not recognize Israel, with which it has been technically at war since \nIsrael\u2019s establishment.  \n \nAlthough Lebanon is a parliamentary republic, it has some human rights \nproblems, including: Lebanese security forces \u201carbitrarily arrested and detained \nindividuals\u201d and \u201cinstances of arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life, torture, and other \nabuse.\u201d Lebanese law does not specifically prohibit torture, and security forces have \nabused detainees and used torture in some instances. Although Lebanese law requires \njudicial warrants before arrests, except in situations involving immediate pursuit, the \ngovernment had arbitrarily arrested and detained persons. Many provisions of the law \nconcerning the rights of persons arrested and detained are not observed in practice, \nand security forces continue the practice of arbitrary arrest and detention.  Although the \nlaw prohibits it, Lebanese authorities \u201cfrequently interfered with the privacy of persons \nregarded as enemies of the government.\u201d  Furthermore, \u201c[m]ilitias and non-Lebanese \nforces operating outside the area of [Lebanon\u2019s] central government authority frequently \nviolated citizens\u2019 privacy rights\u201d and \u201c[v]arious factions used informer networks and \nmonitoring of telephones to obtain information regarding their perceived adversaries.\u201d  \n \nThe terrorist group Hezbollah is a Lebanese-based radical Shi\u2019a group and is \ndesignated by the U.S. as a \u201cForeign Terrorist Organization.\u201d It is allied to and \nsupported by the Iranian Government. The Lebanese government recognizes Hezbollah \nas a \u201clegitimate resistance group and political party and was represented by elected \nofficials in the Lebanese parliament. Hezbollah also provides support to several \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPalestinian terrorist organizations and is known to be involved in numerous anti-U.S. \nand anti-Israeli terrorist attacks. Americans have been the targets of numerous terrorist \nattacks in Lebanon.  \n \n \nThe United States seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties with \nLebanon and to help preserve its independence, sovereignty, national unity and \nterritorial integrity. The U.S. provides more than $400 million in aid to Lebanon and \npledged $1 billion in additional aid. The aid reflects the importance the U.S. attaches to \nLebanon\u2019s development as a unified, independent and sovereign country. \n \n \nU.S. citizens who also possess Lebanese nationality may be subject to \nlaws that impose special obligations on them as Lebanese citizens. Presently there is a \ntravel warning for U.S. citizens traveling to Lebanon due to the threat against \nwesterners. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying:  \n \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information; and \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \n \nThese disqualifying conditions, AG \u00b6 7 (a), (b), and (e), have applicability on \nthese facts.  The majority of Applicant\u2019s family are citizens and residents of Lebanon. \nThese relationships could create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure or coercion because a third party may threaten or coerce \nApplicant\u2019s family members.  The Hezbollah and Syrian presence in Lebanon, coupled \nwith the residue of the civil war and the violent incidents in the past few years, create a \nheightened risk of coercion or pressure. The AG \u00b6 7 (a) disqualifying condition applies. \n \n \nApplicant has traveled frequently to Lebanon to visit his family members there, \nindicating a strong connection to that country.  He has not shown that he has stronger \nties to the United States, by owning real estate here and having family in the United \nStates.  He has the burden of proof on this issue and all issues, and has failed to \npresent any evidence of a stronger tie to the United States than to Lebanon.  Thus, the \nsame type of security concern under AG \u00b6 7 (a) would apply under this disqualifying \ncondition AG \u00b6 7 (b).   \n \n \nApplicant has not disclosed his income from his government contractor \nemployment.  However, after having accountant and cashier jobs from 1995 onward, \nand periodic unemployment, he managed to accumulate $657,000, his net worth.  He \nkept $495,000 in two foreign bank accounts, which he now claims he closed but failed \nto reveal where he deposited it.  Again, he failed to submit evidence to meet his burden \nof proof.  Under AG \u00b6 7 (e), he has a \u201csubstantial financial in a foreign country.\u201d  \nDesiring to retain this job and its income, Applicant could be coerced or manipulated \ninto violating security regulations.  This disqualifying condition applies. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising under \nthis guideline:  \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government \nbusiness or are approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and, \n \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \n \n \nThe two potentially mitigating conditions are AG \u00b6 8 (a) and (b).  The remaining \nfour mitigating conditions are not applicable for consideration because Applicant failed \nto submit any evidence that his familial contacts were casual and infrequent, that any \nforeign contacts he may have are on U.S. Government business or approved by any \nsecurity authority, or that he complied with any agency requirements reporting any \nforeign contacts.  Most importantly, the value of his savings deposits in Lebanon and \nTurkey was so large that it is likely they would result in a conflict and be used to \ninfluence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant as he protected them.  His substantial net \nworth is a similar factor, as is how he accumulated so much money in the six years \nsince 2003.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 (a), if applicable, would require Applicant to demonstrate that his familial \nrelationship with all his siblings and mother in Lebanon, and the situation in Lebanon, \ncould not result in Applicant him being placed in a position to have to choose between \nthem and the interests of the U.S. Government. The greater weight of Applicant\u2019s \nproperty and family relationships are in Lebanon.  The Syrian and Hezbollah presence \nin Lebanon makes such a choice more likely than not in Applicant\u2019s case.  He has not \npresented any evidence to show that this mitigating condition should apply.    \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 (b) is another mitigating condition that requires Applicant to have a \ngreater connections to the United States than to his ancestral Lebanon.  Applicant failed \nto meet his burden of proof on this condition, because he did not show that he had real \nestate and investments of greater worth in the United States than in Lebanon.  All his \nmoney was, and may be still, in Lebanon and Turkey.  He did not show where the \nmoney went when he closed the savings accounts in those countries.  Moving such a \nlarge sum into the United States from the Middle East region might also trigger some \nU.S. banking regulations, and Applicant has not shown he complied with such \nregulations if he did move the money to the United States.  His residence is a mystery, \nas are the sources and current location of his substantial net worth.  For these reasons, \nthis mitigating condition does not apply. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant\u2019s family and net worth are \nlocated in Lebanon. His investments in Lebanese and Turkish banks are voluntary. \nThere is great potential for coercion, pressure, exploitation, or duress because of all his \nfamily members and his net worth being in a country, which is subject to frequent \nterrorist and Syrian influence.  These circumstances will continue.  More significantly, \nApplicant failed to present evidence to establish an accurate accounting of his net \nworth, the location of his money, and strong connections to the United States when \ncontrasted with his connections to Lebanon. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his foreign \ninfluence. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 12, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 18, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on October 29, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant admits that as of May 30, 2008, he was indebted to the following\ncreditors in the following approximate amounts: California BU/Medical $25.00; a medical\naccount $33.00; and OPN Credit/Old Point/Automobile $7,438.00. All three accounts\nare delinquent and have been placed for collection.\nAs of May 2008, applicant was indebted to Meritech mortgage in the approximate\npast-due amount of $5,759.00. Even if this debt was \u201ctaken over\u201d by applicant\u2019s ex-wife\nas he claims in his SOR response, without a release from the creditor, he is still liable\nfor the debt.\nApplicant is indebted to P******* R****** GE in the amount of $525.00 as a result\nof a judgment entered against him in April 2007.\nApplicant is indebted to Cap 1 Bank in the approximate amount of $825.00. This\ndebt is past-due.\nApplicant is indebted to Prince Park /Triangle Rent A Car, Inc. in the approximate\namount of $136.00. This debt has been placed for collection.\nAs of March 2008, applicant owed the Commonwealth of Virginia at least\n$2,222.09 in past-due child support.\nApplicant is indebted to Jeffersncp in the approximate amount of $1,933.00. This\ndelinquent debt originated with Aspire Visa (Exhibits 5 and 7).\nApplicant is indebted to Providian in the approximate amount of $1,724.00\n(Exhibits 4 and 7).\nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in January 2003. His case was\ndismissed in April 2006 for failure to make payments to the bankruptcy trustee.\nApplicant provided a personal financial statement to DOHA in April 2008, which\nshowed he had approximately $428.00 in discretionary income. In his response to the\nSOR, applicant stated this \u201cextra\u201d income is being used to \u201ccatch up on child support\npayments.\u201d\nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) in September 2007. In response to three questions on the e-QIP, applicant\ndenied that (1) in the prior seven years he had any judgments against him that he had\nnot paid, (2) in the prior seven years he had been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt, and (3) he was then over 90 days delinquent on any debts. In fact, at minimum,\napplicant was over 180 days delinquent on his debts to California BU/Medical, OPN\nCredit, the Commonwealth of Virginia, Jeffersncp, and Providian when he completed\nthe e-QIP. And, the $525.00 judgment debt, which remains unpaid, was entered against\n\n3\nhim in April 2007. In his response to the SOR, applicant denied that he deliberately\nprovided the false information. I find that applicant\u2019s false answers were intentional.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\n4\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of an inability or\nunwillingness to pay his debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s failure to honor his\nfinancial obligations is ongoing, and it casts doubt on his current reliability and\njudgment. Accordingly, this mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\nfailed to provide any credible evidence to support application of this mitigating condition.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. There is no evidence of counseling. And,\nthe problem is not being resolved and it is clearly not under control. Accordingly, this\nmitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d This mitigating\ncondition does not apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\n\n5\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is applicable.\nI considered the potentially mitigating conditions under this Guideline and\nconclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

On July 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns regarding\ncriminal conduct (Guideline J) and financial considerations (Guideline E). The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn July 23, 2008, Applicant signed a notarized document in which he admitted\nthe allegation raised under Guideline J and admitted two of the three allegations under\nGuideline F. He also requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA\nreceived the request on August 8, 2008, and I was assigned the case on August 18,\n2008. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to a September 17, 2008, hearing\nDecember 17, 2008\n\n TR. 45.\n    1\n The female Marine\u2019s unauthorized absence was imputed on to Applicant as an aider and abetter.\n    2\n2\ndate. A notice to that effect was issued by DOHA on August 27, 2008. The hearing was\ntimely convened. Department Counsel introduced five documents, accepted into the\nrecord as exhibits (Exs.) 1-5 without objection. Applicant gave testimony and offered no\ndocuments. He was given until September 26, 2008, to submit any documents for\nconsideration. Five documents were received by Department Counsel via facsimile\ntransmission on September 30, 2008. Department Counsel forwarded them to me\nwithout objection on October 2, 2008. They were accepted into the record as Exs. A-E.\nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on October 3, 2008, and the record was closed. Based\nupon a review of the limited case file and exhibits presented, Applicant failed to carry\nhis burden and mitigate security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 39-year-old currently teaching at a community college. He has a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Sciences, a master\u2019s degree in information technology\nmanagement, and a master\u2019s degree in information security. He served nearly 17 years\nin the United States Marine Corps. Divorced, he is the father of a 12-year-old daughter.\nIn 2003, Applicant was still married, in the Marines, and had recently been\nselected to be a Warrant Officer I in the Marines. One day in November 2003, he got a\ncall from a young female Marine, claiming she had been raped and that the command\nwas not doing anything about it. He had not heard a rape reported, so he started asking\nquestions within the command. She went into hiding. He located her and met her in\ntown. During the time together, they secretly became intimate and violated the Marine\nCorps fraternization policy. Soon thereafter, he was interviewed about her whereabouts.\nApplicant, however, felt the investigators were more interested in his involvement with\nthe woman. He was interviewed again. The investigator suggested he might be in\nviolation of the fraternization order. Later, Applicant was interviewed at the local sheriff\u2019s\ndepartment about the missing woman. He made a number of phone calls, resulting in\nthe discovery of her most current location. When it was determined she was unharmed,\nApplicant assumed the matter was over. \nSoon thereafter, Applicant met with investigators from the criminal investigations\ndivision (CID). He believed that a number of irregularities were taking place during the\ninvestigation. Consequently, he was mistrustful of the military attorneys available to\nprovide guidance and defend him. Borrowing about $7,500 from his credit union,\nApplicant hired a private attorney.  Eventually, a special court-martial was held.\n1\nApplicant appeared before a jury and entered not guilty pleas. In April 2004, he was\nfound guilty of three counts under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ): Article\n86: Unauthorized Absence,  Article 92: Violate Lawful General Regulation, and, with\n2\nsome exceptions, Article 134: Adultery. The sentence was reduction to the E-1 pay\ngrade and six months confinement. The case was reviewed and approved. He was not\ngiven a bad conduct discharge, but an administrative discharge was arranged.\n\n Tr. 26.\n    3\n Tr. 39.\n    4\n e.g., Ex. E (Sept. 2008 statement).\n    5\n Tr. 27.\n    6\n Tr. 60.\n    7\n3\nApplicant was discharged in June 2004. He went to live with his mother. He used about\n$10,000 from a credit line to pay his bills and transition back to civilian life.  He then\n3\nreturned to college, where he recently earned a second master\u2019s degree. He was hired\nfor a network administrator job in July 2005, but that job ended in June 2007. Since\nthen, he has been teaching.\nApplicant is unsure of what subsequent reviews of his case took place. He\nsolicited assistance from a national legal group, but no progress was made. He then\ncalled the Marine Corps, which transferred the matter to the Naval Review Board,\nwhere the case now resides. Presently, however, Applicant cannot afford the $10,000\nfee for a private attorney.  He is contrite over the incident and recognizes his guilt, but\n4\nmaintains the process used was flawed.\nApplicant admits he owes his credit union a balance of $7,573 for an attorney he\nhired prior to his court-martial. That account is now handled by a collection agency.\nApplicant states that he has made regular payments of about $25 per month on the\naccount since 2007, but concedes there were periods when he was unable to pay.  \n5\nAlso delinquent is a bank card account with a balance of approximately $10,723.\nIt is the account Applicant used to\u201chelp establish [him] back [home] and pay off any\nloans [he] had from whatever.\u201d\nA $94 tele-communications bill remains outstanding in his name. The debt was\nincurred by his ex-wife. Applicant testified he disputed the account entry on his credit\nreport, but provided no evidence of such dispute.    \n6\nApplicant shares custody with his daughter. Child support has been his top\nfinancial priority and his payments are up to date. Applicant stresses that he is currently\nundergoing an atypically rough time following his discharge, noting that before his\ndischarge, he was always timely with his bills.  He also noted the difficulty in finding\n7\nwork in his region currently.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n    8\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n    9\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n    10\n Id.\n    11\n4\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n8\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n9\n10\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\n\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n    12\n5\ninformation. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n12\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nand Guideline F (Financial Considerations) to be the most pertinent to the case.\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. With respect to Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct), the Government has established its case. Applicant admits he was convicted\nunder three articles of the UCMJ. Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC)\nAG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d), and CC DC AG \u00b6 31(c)\n(\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted\u201d) apply.\nThe incidents giving rise to Applicant\u2019s conviction before a special court-martial\noccurred in November 2003. His behavior at the time clearly demonstrated poor\njudgment, particularly in light of his recent selection for promotion. He has been tried,\nhowever, received his sentence, and been penalized. Over five years have passed\nsince the incident occurred. Having been administratively discharged, there is little\nlikelihood such an incident will be repeated. He acknowledges his wrongful behavior\nand is contrite. There have been no subsequent acts, criminal or otherwise, bringing\ninto question Applicant\u2019s judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. Consequently,\nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) applies.\nApplicant admits to the conduct alleged and to his military convictions. Therefore,\nneither CC MC AG \u00b6 32(b) (\u201cthe person was pressured or coerced into committing the\nact and those pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life\u201d) nor AG \u00b6 32(c)\n(\u201cevidence the person did not commit the act\u201d) apply.\nSince the 2003 incident and 2004 military conviction, Applicant has lived a quiet\nlife. No subsequent criminal activity has occurred in the intervening years. He has\nexpressed his contrition over the incident. He returned to graduate school and earned a\nsecond master\u2019s degree. Applicant is currently teaching at a community college. CC MC\nAG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n    13\n6\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement\u201d) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s military conviction occurred about five years ago. He is unlikely to find\nhimself in such an unusual scenario again. Now a civilian, he has moved on and tried to\nput his past behind him. With his extra graduate degree, he is currently sharing his\npassion for technological management and security with students. While Applicant\nremains discontented over his conviction, it is not with regard to his behavior or the\nconviction, but the process used. There is nothing in the record to suggest he will again\nengage in activities which bring into question his ability or willingness to comply with the\nlaw, rules, or regulations.  \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \nFailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Conversely, an individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  The Regulation sets out several potential disqualifying conditions. \n13\nWorried that legal proceedings would be commenced against him, Appellant\ntook borrowed money to hire an attorney. After his discharge, he took a second loan\nagainst a credit card to pay off bills and make a fresh start. As well, a minor\ntelecommunications charge appears on an account in his name. All accounts remain\nsubstantially \nunaddressed \nto \ndate. \nConsequently, \nFinancial \nConsiderations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d)\nand .FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) apply. With\nsuch conditions raised, it is left to Appellant to overcome the case against him and\nmitigate security concerns. \nApplicant mistrusted the free military legal aide available to him while he was\nunder investigation, so he hired a private attorney. Later, he took a $10,000 loan to help\nhim transition back into civilian life after his convictions. Both of these obligations came\nabout as a consequence of the volitional act he performed which led to his court-\nmartial. Therefore, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b)\n(\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a\ndeath, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances\u201d) does not apply.\nDespite some nominal payments on one account and Applicant\u2019s testimony he\nhas disputed one nominal bill, Applicant has over $18,000 in delinquent debt which\nremains largely unaddressed. Therefore, neither Financial Considerations Mitigating\n\n7\nCondition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d), FC MC\nAG \u00b6 20(d), (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u201d), nor FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control\u201d) apply.\nLittle has been done to address Applicant\u2019s debt since it was acquired. Although\nhis employment has been erratic since leaving the military, Applicant has failed to offer\nevidence of any alternative strategies or approaches he might have made to address\nhis debt, such as utilization of an effective financial counselor, bankruptcy, or\ncomprehensive repayment or consolidation plan. With the balances virtually unchanged\nand no documentary evidence of efforts to resolve his debt, combined with a failure to\noutline strategies on how he might address this debt in the near future, financial\nconsiderations security concerns remain unmitigated. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors.\nApplicant is a mature, intelligent, and affable man whose military career took an\nunexpected turn. Convicted under the UCMJ nearly five years ago, Applicant was\npunished and lost his career. Contrite, he has since led a life devoid of crime and\nconflict. Applicant has mitigated criminal conduct security concerns. \nFeeling pushed through the military justice system in a manner Applicant is still\nconvinced was inappropriate, he was discharged with significant legal debt. In turn, debt\nwas incurred to pad his transition back to civilian life. Since that time, there has been\nvirtually no concerted effort to address it in any comprehensive manner. Barring\ntangible evidence of such efforts, financial considerations security concerns remain\nunmitigated. Clearance is denied.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006.\nJanuary 8, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (undated), and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on\nSeptember 17, 2008, and it was assigned to another judge the following day. It was\ntransferred to me on October 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 8,\n2008, scheduling a hearing on October 24, 2008, and it was convened on that date. \nAt the hearing, the government offered seven exhibits (Exhs. 1-7) which were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted eight exhibits which were\nadmitted without objection (Exhs. A-H). She testified on her own behalf as did her\ncertified financial counselor (Exh. E). DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing\non October 28, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\nNovember 24, 2008, to submit additional evidence. No additional information was\nreceived. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural Rulings\nNotice\nThe hearing notice was dated within 15 days before the hearing date. I advised\nApplicant of her right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the\nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived her right to the 15 days notice and indicated she\nwas ready to proceed (Tr. 7). \nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted three and denied three of the six\nallegations in the SOR relating to approximately $17,000 in delinquent debts. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a government contractor working since\nFebruary 2005 as a long-haul truck driver carrying cargo that includes defense\nequipment. She was working as a team with her husband but discovered that she had\ncancer in 2008. She and her husband separated at that time. She is undergoing\nchemotherapy for the cancer and cannot work because of the adverse effect of the\ntherapy. She hopes to return to work either with her husband if they are reconciled, or\nfind another driver/partner. Meanwhile she lives with her mother and shares living\nexpenses. She does not own an automobile but drives her son\u2019s car when she is\nphysically able to do so. She held a security clearance for approximately six years but\ndoes not have one now. \nApplicant\u2019s only income is a temporary Social Security SSI payment of $637 per\nmonth because of her illness. It is supplemented by food stamps worth $136. She has a\nbudget program developed with her financial counselor that indicates expenses of $422\nper month and payment on her debts of $130. The balance is for contingencies. She\nhas two grown children for whom she has no financial responsibility. \n\n3\nApplicant paid a retainer of $400 for the services of a debt counseling\norganization. The owner of that company appeared with her at the hearing to explain\nthe status of her debts and action taken to resolve them. In summary they are as\nfollows:\n1.SOR \u00b6 1.a. Utility debt of $381 (Tr. 28) being paid by $30 per month payments\n(Exh. D). \n2 SOR \u00b6 1.b. Medical debt of $566 (Exh. C). Arrangements have been made for\npayment of $50 per month and payments have been made since April 2008.\nPayments include amount stated in SOR \u00b6 1.e. to same creditor. Tota amount\nnow owed to the creditor is approximately $500. \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c. Medical bill of $2,266 being paid with $50 per month payments.\n(Exhs. A and F). Four payments had been made at time of hearing (Tr. 20). \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.d. Auto repossession charges of $13,000. Some payments were\nmade and the debt is not now on credit report for original owner of the debt.\nHowever, it was likely sold to another creditor. Payments originally set for $326\nper month and a few payments made (Exhs. B 2). The plan now schedules\npayments of $50 per month (Exh. F) but no payments have been made in that\namount. Applicant now questions the validity of the amount of the debt. \n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e. Additional debt of $188 to same creditor as alleged in SOR \u00b6\n1.b.(See par. 2 above).\n6. SOR \u00b6 1.f. Bank debt of $750 which Applicant disputed. Investigation by\ncredit reporting agency resulted in deletion from report (Exh. H). \nWhile Applicant is making progress in paying the debts her income is not only low\nbut is contingent on the agreement of the Social Security Administration to continue her\nSSI payments depending on the surgery and medical treatments she will receive. At the\ntime of the hearing she knew that the payments would be made for another three\nmonths but did not know what they would be after that time. No information was\nprovided on the subject after the hearing.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-\narchingadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to\nAG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known\n\n4\nas the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Ther\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\n\n5\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated the delinquent debts cited in the SOR and\nwas unable or unwilling to pay the obligations for several years. The evidence shows\nthat she has been able pay some of the debts and has worked out a payment plan for\nothers consistent with her limited income. Thus the evidence clearly raises these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes several mitigating conditions (MC) that could mitigate\nsecurity concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying\ncondition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ \nMost of Applicant=s financial problems arose as a result of her loss of\nemployment, her separation, her illness, and the adverse reaction to her treatment for\ncancer. Hopefully, these conditions will not recur but at this point her medical indications\ndo not provide sufficient assurance that her income will likely be sufficient to continue to\nresolve the financial issues. \nAG & 20 (c) applies when the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control. Applicant has received and continues to receive good advice from her\ncounselor and has a plan that is being implemented with the income she has available. \nAG & 20 (d) applies where the evidence shows the person initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. While it not necessary that\nall of the delinquent debts be resolved for mitigation to apply, it is necessary that a\nsignificant portion of the debts be settled or paid. Four of the remaining delinquent debts\nare being resolved by payment through a credit counselor, one was disputed and\nremoved from the credit report. The repossession, by far the largest, is still unresolved,\nalthough the amount is in dispute and a few payments were made on the debt a number\nof months ago. \nAG & 20 (e) applies when the person has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of of the debt and provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. Applicant\nhas shown that the one disputed debt has been resolved in her favor (Exh. H). \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\n\n6\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must\nbe an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n           I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwith questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nat this time. I recognize her expressed interest to resolve these financial issues to restore\nher credit rating and continue to hold a security clearance. While she entered debt\ncounseling and has been able to reduce her delinquent debts and enter a plan to pay\nthem with the limited amount available from her SSI payments, the financial prospects\nare not sufficiently solid as to give confidence that the debts be substantially resolved.\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from these financial\nconsiderations. It is premature at this time to grant a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n                           Paragraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:  For Applicant  \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in the case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is denied.\nCharles D. Ablard\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 13, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 31, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant had accumulated 8 debts totaling approximately\n$247,000.  Decision at 2.  The Judge found that: \u201cOf those eight debts, none have been proven to be\npaid except the last listed debt in Paragraph 1.h.\u201d  Id.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could\nreasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  \nThe Judge explicitly discussed Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s illness and the role that played in his recent\nfinancial difficulties. The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to\nmake a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nThe Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the recency and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After\nreviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.
