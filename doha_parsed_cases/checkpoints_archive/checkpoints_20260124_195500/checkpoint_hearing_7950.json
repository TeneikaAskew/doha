Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns pertaining to Financial \nConsiderations. Clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-Qip), on April 16, 2007.1 On April 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 25, 2008, which was \nreceived at DOHA on April 29, 2008. She answered the SOR in writing on May 15, \n \n1 Applicant had previously submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on April 18, 2006. \nGE 2. \nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel \nwas prepared to proceed on May 27, 2008, and I received the case assignment on June \n4, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 23, 2008, scheduling the hearing for \nJuly 23, 2008.  The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nreceived without objection. The Government also submitted a Government\u2019s Exhibit \nList, which was marked as Exhibit (Ex.) I. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough G, which were received without objection, and she testified on her own behalf. I \nheld the record open to afford Applicant the opportunity to submit additional material. \nShe timely submitted AE H through W, without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on July 31, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.c., 1.e. \u2013 1.f., \n1.h. \u2013 1.j., and 1.m. She denied the allegation contained in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.g., and 1.k. \u2013 \n1.l. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review \nof the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old security officer, who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since April 2006. She currently holds a secret clearance, which she has held \nsince November 2001, granted to her while in the U.S. Army, discussed infra. She \nseeks a top secret clearance, which she stated is a job requirement. GE 1, Response to \nSOR, Tr. 15-16, 20-22.   \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1987. She served in the U.S. Army \nfrom October 2000 to February 2006, and was honorably discharged. While in the \nArmy, her primary Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) was Ammunition Supply \nSpecialist, and her secondary MOS was Recruiter. Beyond high school, she attended \ncollege and estimates she has earned approximately 45 college credit hours. GE 1, Tr. \n16-20. She has never been married and has no dependents. GE 1, Tr. 15.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded among other things the review of her April 2007 e-QIP, her April 2006 SF-86, \nher April 2008 and April 2007 credit bureau reports (CBR), and her March 2008 Signed \nResponses to Interrogatories and Attachments. GE 1 \u2013 5. \n \nThe SOR alleged 13 separate allegations, 12 of which are debts approximating \n$34,406, under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. They are itemized and discussed \nin order. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is a judgment in the amount of $2,113 against Applicant in July 2007. \nThe creditor sought payment for furniture Applicant purchased and financed in 2005 \nwhile she was still in the Army. Applicant stopped making payments after she was \ndischarged from the Army in February 2006 stating, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a job. I was making a \n\n \n3 \n \n \ntransition from the military to the civilian world.\u201d Tr. 25. (She began her present job in \nApril 2006, two months after she was discharged from the Army.) Applicant never did \nresume voluntary payments to this creditor after being discharged from the Army. To \ncollect money owed, the creditor filed suit against Applicant in July 2007, and later \ngarnished her wages in February 2008 until the debt was satisfied. Applicant received a \nnotice of satisfaction from the district court stating the judgment had been paid in full Tr. \n24-30, AE A, AE T. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is a judgment in the amount of $8,608 against Applicant in May 2007 \nin favor of her former landlord for back rent. When asked how this debt arose, Applicant \nanswered: \n \nLike I said, during the time when I got out of the military I was just going \nthrough financial hardship. I had family situations and I was the only one \nthat could help in that situation so I got out a loan to help pay the funeral \ncosts of my grandfather and my grandmother died shortly after that, well, \nbefore that. And just bills with family and that\u2019s basically \u2013 \n \nApplicant was evicted in May 2007 for non-payment of rent and explained: \n \nWell, I had a roommate and at the time when I was at the apartment \ncomplex there were, the Resident Manager had changed 3 times and they \nstarted a new system with the apartment complex. And basically they said \nthat I owed more than I did and I had the evidence to support when I went \nto court but you know, I was found guilty of it and forced to pay. But I had \na roommate and my roommate moved out and I was just unable to pay the \nbill on my own. Tr. 31-33. \n \nThe roommate moved out of the apartment to live with her mother six months before \nApplicant was evicted. The landlord obtained a judgment against Applicant and her \nroommate. Applicant stopped making payments to the landlord when her roommate \nmoved out and testified neither she nor her roommate made any payments to her \nlandlord after her roommate moved out, discussed infra. Applicant further testified that \nshe has not made any payments to her landlord since her landlord obtained a judgment \nagainst her and her roommate. However, in her Response to SOR, Applicant stated, \u201cI \nam currently paying the company $250.00 monthly.\u201d In Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nsubmission, she included an undated copy of a letter purportedly sent to the landlord\u2019s \nmanagement company confirming payment arrangements at the rate of $200 per \nmonth. No proof of payment accompanied this letter. Tr. 31-40, Response to SOR, AE \nP. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to the garnishment action the furniture company initiated after \nobtaining a judgment against Applicant, discussed supra.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. is a collection account for $978 for cable services. Applicant denied \nthis bill and is currently disputing the validity of the debt with the cable company. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant testified her last communication with the cable company occurred in April \n2008 by telephone. Post-hearing, Applicant submitted an undated letter purportedly sent \nto the cable company claiming she did not open an account with them adding she did \nnot physically reside in the area where the services were provided. There is no \nevidence in the record containing a response from the cable company. Tr. 42-45, AE N. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. is a collection account for $112 for cable services. Applicant claimed \nthis debt was paid, but did not have any documentation. At her hearing, she stated she \nhad documentation, but did not bring it with her to the hearing. Post-hearing, she \nsubmitted an undated letter purportedly sent to her bank/credit union seeking \ndocumentation that would reflect payment to this cable company. Response to SOR, Tr. \n45-47, AE I. Applicant\u2019s documentation fails to clarify her status with this creditor. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. is a collection account for $179 for an undefined service provided to \nApplicant while she was in the Army. She paid this debt in March 2008. Response to \nSOR, AE C, AE W, Tr.  47-48. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. is a collection account for $342 for telephone services. Applicant is \ndisputing this debt claiming she was being billed for services she did not receive. \nApplicant claimed that she wrote a letter in April 2008 to the creditor disputing this debt, \nbut did not have the letter with her at her hearing. Post-hearing she submitted a letter \npurportedly sent to the creditor advising that \u201csomeone in [state where telephone was \nprovided] has a home in my name without my knowledge.\u201d She also disputed this debt \non her credit report. Tr. 48-54, AE D, AE L. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. and 1.i. are charged off accounts for $8,899 and $500, respectively, \nto the same credit union. At her hearing, Applicant testified she was given this loan in \n2006 to help her sister who was experiencing a foreclosure proceeding. In her \nResponse to SOR, she stated these loans were to help her family pay the funeral costs \nfor a family member who had passed away. Applicant was employed at the time, but \nnever made any payments citing \u201cfinancial hardship.\u201d At her hearing, she stated she had \ncontacted the credit union to set up payments and was informed her account had been \ncharged off and that she would be contacted by their attorney. Applicant added her \nrecent attempts to settle this account had been unsuccessful, and that she had written \nto the credit union seeking settlement, but did not have a copy of that letter at her \nhearing. Post-hearing, she submitted a letter purportedly sent to the credit union offering \nto make monthly payments of $500 per month. Regardless of what this loan was for, \nthere is no evidence in the record indicating her offer was accepted and/or that \nApplicant is making payments to the credit union. Tr. 54-63, AE M. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j. is a charged off account for $9,502 to a different credit union. At her \nhearing, Applicant stated she was given this loan in 2006 to help her family pay the \nfuneral costs for a family member who had passed away. Applicant has made payment \narrangements with this credit union to pay $400 per month beginning on July 28, 2008. \nShe submitted documentation from the credit union reflecting this payment \n\n \n5 \n \n \narrangement, but no documentation of having actually made any payments. Tr. 61-65, \nAE E, AE V. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. is a collection account for $976 for cell phone services. Applicant \nsuccessfully contested this debt claiming she was the victim of identity theft. The cell \nphone company sent Applicant a letter dated May 6, 2008 canceling her account and \nabsolving her from any financial responsibility for the account. Tr. 65-66, AE F, AE G. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l. is a collection account for $3,036 to a state college for tuition. \nApplicant claimed in her Response to SOR that she attended that college on a full \nathletic scholarship before joining the Army and was billed for classes after joining the \nArmy. The college has already recouped $2,500 through garnishment and the $3,036 is \nthe balance owed. Applicant testified she has been in contact with the college by \ntelephone as recently as one week before her hearing. She also testified she wrote the \ncollege a letter in April 2008 attempting to resolve her debt, but did not have that letter \nwith her at the hearing. Post-hearing Applicant submitted an undated letter purportedly \nsent to the college attempting to resolve this debt. There is nothing in the record \ndocumenting this debt has been paid/resolved. Tr. 66-72. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m. is a collection account for $161 to an insurance company. \nApplicant\u2019s contention that this debt was paid was unsupported by the documentary \nevidence. Tr. 72-74. \n \nAt the time of hearing, Applicant had not sought financial counseling. Post-\nhearing she submitted documentation that she had made an appointment on July 28, \n2008 with a credit counseling service. The credit counseling service reviewed \nApplicant\u2019s current income, living expenses, assets and liabilities to help analyze her \nfinancial situation and created a budget and action plan for Applicant. Tr. 74, AE Q, AE \nS. \n \nApplicant former roommate testified, the roommate Applicant referred to in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b., discussed supra. The witness/former roommate was named as a co-defendant in \nthe lawsuit their former landlord filled to recoup back rent. The witness is a middle \nschool teacher, and testified she did not think Applicant would compromise any \ninformation involving her job as a security officer. The witness also testified she and the \nApplicant began paying $200 per month about four months ago on this judgment and \nthat these payments have been made from a checking account they share. (This \nconflicts with Applicant\u2019s earlier testimony.) The witness testified that Applicant lives \nwith her and her mother and that Applicant \u201cgives us what she can.\u201d Tr. 80-89. \n \nApplicant stated she made \u201csome bad decisions clearly here, bad financial \ndecisions.\u201d She submitted one reference letter from a work supervisor, who provided \nfavorable comments about Applicant. AE H. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),2 the Government\u2019s concern is that \nan Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet her financial obligations dating back to \n2006, shortly after she was discharged from the Army. She has accumulated substantial \ndebt in the last several years approximating $35,000.  \n \nThe Government established its case under this concern through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and evidence presented. Although Applicant made some headway on \nseveral of the debts alleges, the majority of her indebtedness remains unresolved. Her \nfinancial difficulties remain ongoing. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition  \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations; apply in this case.  \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,3 I conclude that Applicant is able to \nreceive partial credit under Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (MC) AG \u00b6 \n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances; for her brief period of unemployment in 2006 after she was \ndischarged from the Army and the death of family members. I also gave Applicant \npartial credit for making the effort to receive credit counseling under AG \u00b6 20(c) the \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. \n \nHowever, whatever credit she received by those MCs is overcome by the past \nseveral years of financial mismanagement and failure to handle her finances in a \nresponsible manner. Applicant presented minimal evidence documenting efforts taken \nto contact or resolve debts with her unpaid creditors. What evidence she did offer \noccurred well after the indebtedness had reached a crisis point. Nor does the evidence \nsupport the notion that her recent participation in financial counseling netted any \ntangible results.  \n \n2  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n3  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as \na whole. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nI am able to give Applicant full credit for resolving several of her debts as a result \nof having paid some debts and being the victim of identify theft. Application of AG \u00b6 \n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts; and AG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue; is warranted for these debts and is reflected under Formal \nFindings, infra. \n \nUnfortunately, for the majority of Applicant\u2019s debts, especially in the case of her \nlarger debts, she has done too little too late. She presented little evidence to show she \nhas dealt responsibly with her financial obligations before, or especially after receipt of \nthe SOR (i.e., paid debts, settlements, documented negotiations, credible payment \nplans). Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding \nthat she has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that she has taken \ncontrol of her financial situation. Based on her past performance, her prospective \nassurances ring hollow. Her financial problems are likely to be a concern in the future. \nMoreover, her financial problems are recent, not isolated, and ongoing. Hence, more \ntime is needed for Applicant to put her financial house in order and establish a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant did not meet her \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial difficulties.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b. - 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f. \u2013 1.g.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h. \u2013 1.j.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k..:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l. \u2013 1.m.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with explanations in his response to the SOR (GE 13). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 54 or 55 years old (Tr. 8). He was unsure about his date of birth (Tr. 23). He was born in Kurdistan and when he was old enough he joined the Kurdistan liberation forces (Tr. 50). When the Shah of Iran was in power, Applicant served with 1The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names of other groups or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information. 3 Iranian forces and other Kurds in opposition to Saddam Hussein (Tr. 30-31). Then Iran and Iraq made a treaty and Applicant became a refugee in Iran (Tr. 31). On October 10, 1976, Applicant immigrated to the United States from Iran (Tr. 32, 43; GE 2). He became a U.S. citizen in 1991 (GE 3). Applicant married in 1981 and divorced in 1988 (GE 2). He married his wife in 1991 (GE 2). His children were born in the United States in 1982, 1995, and 2004 (GE 2). His current wife was born in Iraq and became a U.S. citizen in 1998 (GE 2). Applicant\u2019s mother, four brothers, sister and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Iraq (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.f and 2.h; Tr. 47-48).

In 1976, Applicant fled to \nIran and then that same year, he settled in the United States. He became a U.S. citizen \nin 1991. His wife was born in Iraq and became a U.S. citizen in 1998. His three children \nare U.S. citizens. Applicant returned to Iraq from 2005 to 2007, and served with U.S. \ncombat forces as a translator. Applicant went on hundreds of dangerous patrols with \nU.S. Army personnel. Those who served with him in Iraq laud his duty performance and \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. Applicant has significantly greater contacts \nwith the United States than with Iraq. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of U.S. interests. Personal Conduct and Foreign Influence security \nconcerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 9, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF-86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On May 20, \n2005, he submitted an SF-86 (GE 2). On December 12, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and B (Foreign Influence) \n(GE 12). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense \nJuly 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn April 1, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge (GE 13). On May 29, 2009, Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed. On June 15, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me. On June 25, \n2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 11). On July 20, 2009, the hearing was held. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered 10 exhibits (GE 1-10) (Transcript (Tr.) 36-\n37), and Applicant did not offer any exhibits (Tr. 18). There were no objections, and I \nadmitted GE 1-10 (Tr. 37). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and \nthe hearing notice (GE 11-13). I received the transcript on July 24, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice (AN) of facts concerning \nIraq (AN Request with Ex. I to VI; Tr. 38). Department Counsel provided supporting \ndocuments to show detail and context for these facts. Applicant did not object, and I \ngranted Department Counsel\u2019s request (Tr. 38). \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types \nof facts for administrative notice).  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations with explanations in his response to the \nSOR (GE 13). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of \nfact. \n   \nApplicant is 54 or 55 years old (Tr. 8). He was unsure about his date of birth (Tr. \n23). He was born in Kurdistan and when he was old enough he joined the Kurdistan \nliberation forces (Tr. 50). When the Shah of Iran was in power, Applicant served with \n \n1The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names \nof other groups or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources \ncontain more specific information.  \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                             \nIranian forces and other Kurds in opposition to Saddam Hussein (Tr. 30-31). Then Iran \nand Iraq made a treaty and Applicant became a refugee in Iran (Tr. 31). On October 10, \n1976, Applicant immigrated to the United States from Iran (Tr. 32, 43; GE 2). He \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1991 (GE 3). \n \nApplicant married in 1981 and divorced in 1988 (GE 2). He married his wife in \n1991 (GE 2). His children were born in the United States in 1982, 1995, and 2004 (GE \n2).  His current wife was born in Iraq and became a U.S. citizen in 1998 (GE 2). \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, four brothers, sister and father-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.f and 2.h; Tr. 47-48). His brothers and sister work for \nregional government municipalities (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Applicant traveled through Iran on his \nway to Iraq in 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). When Applicant was deployed to Iraq from 2005 to \n2007, he called his mother on the telephone (Tr. 49). He does not provide financial \nsupport to his mother (Tr. 50). He cares about his mother and feels loyalty to her (Tr. \n54). He does not contact his brothers and sisters because when he left home he was a \nteenager and they were much younger (Tr. 50). They have very little in common and he \ndoes not really know them (Tr. 50; GE 13). His mother is the only relative in Iraq that he \ncontacted and communicates to using the telephone, and he only communicates with \nher once or twice a year (Tr. 51-52). His wife may have some contact with her father or \nfamily living in Iraq (Tr. 52-53). However, he was unsure about the degree of contact his \nwife has with her relatives in Iraq (Tr. 53). \n \nIn 2000, Applicant, his wife, and his son visited Applicant\u2019s mother and some \nother relatives in Iraq (Tr. 48; SOR \u00b6 1.k; GE 13). This is the most recent time he has \nseen his mother (Tr. 48). His only other trip to visit his mother was about twenty years \nago (GE 13). \n \nApplicant loves the United States (Tr. 32). He has a wife and three children living \nin the United States (Tr. 32). He owns a car, boat, and house, which are located in the \nUnited States (Tr. 32). He does not own any property in Iraq. \n \nApplicant has excellent Arabic language skills, and is knowledgeable concerning \nMiddle East culture and Islam (Tr. 33-34). He was excited about opposing the terrorists \nand supporting the United States (Tr. 35). He wanted to assist the U.S. Armed Forces \nas a linguist (Tr. 35-36). Applicant served with the U.S. Army for six months of pre-\ndeployment training and then two years in Iraq in the 2005 to 2007 timeframe (Tr. 27-\n28, 59-60). He served with the U.S. Army in Mosul, which is an exceptionally dangerous \narea of Iraq (Tr. 28).  He went on about 300 missions with the U.S Army, patrolling the \nstreets, attacking the enemy, and searching for insurgents and weapons (Tr. 29; GE \n13). He is proud to be an American and cherishes living under the U.S. Constitution, the \nrule of law, and the freedoms embodied in American life (Tr. 32). \n \nNames used on SF-86s \n \nIn Iraq, when a person is born they receive a one-word first name (Tr. 40). \nApplicant was born at home and does not have a birth certificate (Tr. 44). His mother \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \ndid not register him in any official Iraqi records when he was born (Tr. 44). Persons born \nin Iraq also retain their father\u2019s first name, their grandfather\u2019s first name, their great \ngrandfather\u2019s first name, and their great great grandfather\u2019s first name (Tr. 40). The \nnumber of names can extend back many generations (Tr. 40). Additionally, his mother \nadded the name, \u201cMohamad,\u201d which is often added to Iraqi names as a blessing (Tr. 44, \n55). Applicant sometimes used five different names in various combinations: his first \nname, his father\u2019s name, his grandfather\u2019s name, Mohamad, and his great grandfather\u2019s \nname (Tr. 41).   \n \nWhen Applicant completed his May 20, 2005 and September 9, 2005 SF-86s he \nused his first name, and two other names. In the section of these SF-86s for \u201cOther \nNames Used,\u201d he indicated his first name, and two other names (GE 1; GE 2). The \nnames cited were always his first name and combinations of his father\u2019s name, his \ngrandfather\u2019s name, his great grandfather\u2019s name, and/or Mohamad (Tr. 41; GE 1; GE \n2).    \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b state Applicant used various combinations of these five \nnames on financial and judicial records after arriving in the United States. However, he \nalways used the same first name. He explained that he did not list the various \ncombinations of the five names on his SF-86 because he was rushing to complete it at \nhis employer\u2019s request (Tr. 24). He was inconsistent in his use of the various names on \nfinancial and judicial records, as well as on the two SF-86s. His failure to include more \ndetailed information about use of multiple names on his SF-86s was inadvertent, not \nintentional, and not intended to deceive (Tr. 24-26, 43-44, 55-59). \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nA U.S. Army captain, who utilized Applicant\u2019s assistance as a translator in Iraq, \nprovided a letter of recommendation for Applicant (GE 13). The letter lauds Applicant\u2019s \nhard work, dedication, professionalism, competence, and excellence (GE 13). Applicant \n\u201chas unlimited potential and will excel under any circumstance\u201d (GE 13). \n \nOn December 18, 2005, at Mosul, Iraq, Major General David M. Rodriguez \nsigned a certificate of appreciation for Applicant\u2019s support to Operation Iraqi Freedom III \n(GE 13). The certificate thanks Applicant for his \u201chonor, patriotism, and selfless service \nas an interpreter of Task Force Freedom\u201d (GE 13). \n    \nIraq2 \n \nIn 2003, the United States led a coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power \nin Iraq. Following the swift invasion and successful removal from power, the United \nStates endeavored to set a solid foundation of democratic institutions in Iraq. The \n \n2The facts in the section concerning Iraq are from Department Counsel\u2019s factual summary, except \nfor some comments about the relationship between the United States and Iraq, which are from the U.S. \nDepartment of State, Background Note: Iraq, Feb. 2008 (AN I, enclosure I) and U.S. Department of State, \nCountry Specific Information: Iraq, Oct. 22, 2008 (AN I, enclosure III). \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                             \nConstitution in Iraq was ratified on October 15, 2005. After free elections in 2005, Iraq's \nnew government, a parliamentary democracy, took office in March 2006.  \n \nIn 2007, 92% of Iraq\u2019s exports were in crude oil and crude oil materials. Almost \nhalf of Iraq\u2019s exports went to the United States. The U.S.\u2019 ultimate goal in Iraq is to \nestablish a peaceful, united, stable, democratic, and secure nation that will be an ally of \nthe United States in the war against terrorism. The United States has invested \nthousands of lives and billions of dollars to assist in the reconstruction of Iraq. Success \nin Iraq is a high national priority of the United States. \n \nDespite the elections and new government, Baghdad, Mosul and several other \nareas have especially serious problems with violent terrorists and insurgents. Although \nthere have been recent improvements in the security environment, Iraq remains \ndangerous, volatile and unpredictable. Some areas of Iraq are more peaceful and less \nsusceptible to terrorist attacks than others; however, all areas of the country are still \nvery dangerous. Terrorists have the ability to strike most areas of the country with \nexplosive devices and mines. Numerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the \nU.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with U.S. \nand Iraqi aggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in \nIraq remains very high. Terrorist groups can conduct intelligence activities as effectively \nas state intelligence services. \n       \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                             \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and B (Foreign Influence) are the \nrelevant security concerns with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                             \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case in regard to the allegation Applicant provided a false security \nclearance application: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nOn May 20, 2005, and on September 9, 2005, Applicant signed SF-86s. His SF-\n86s asked about \u201cOther Names Used\u201d and Applicant was did not list all the names he \nhad used on various documents such as driver\u2019s licenses, immigration documentation, \nand traffic court. He admitted that his answers about other names used were \nincomplete. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both apply and further review is necessary. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nApplicant credibly stated he carelessly rushed through his SF-86s and failed to \nfully explain his use of his first name with combinations of four other family names. He \ndid not show the careful, conscientious attention to detail necessary to properly \ncomplete his SF-86s. I conclude Applicant\u2019s alleged falsifications of his SF-86s are \nmitigated. Although he provided incomplete information on his SF-86s, AG \u00b6 17(f) \napplies. The falsification allegations are not substantiated. I am satisfied he did not \ndeliberately and intentionally fail to disclose information about his names with intent to \ndeceive.3 I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d in the Findings section of this decision with respect to \nSOR \u00b6 1.   \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n3The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                             \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \nApplicant and his spouse live in the same household, and were both born in Iraq. \nApplicant\u2019s mother, four brothers, sister and father-in-law are citizens and residents of \nIraq (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.f and 2.h). His brothers and sister work for regional government \nmunicipalities (SOR \u00b6 2.g). He visited his family in Iraq in 2000 (SOR \u00b6 2.k). \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s communications with family members living in Iraq are not \nparticularly frequent, his spouse may have more frequent, non-casual communications \nwith family members living in Iraq. \u201c[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person\u2019s \nspouse.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, \n2002). Applicant has not rebutted this presumption. Applicant\u2019s relationship through his \nspouse and through her with family living in Iraq is sufficient to create \u201ca heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his spouse creates a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and [his] desire to help\u201d his \nfamily living in Iraq. Applicant has deep affection for his mother, who is living in Iraq.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with his spouse and his mother, is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if he has a close \nrelationship with even one relative, who has a relationship with other family members \nliving in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See \nGenerally ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Iraq with the United States, places a significant, but not insurmountable \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                             \nburden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships with his spouse, \nher family and his mother do not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed \ninto a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States \nand a desire to assist family living in Iraq.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Iraq seek or have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his family, \nnevertheless, his relationship with his spouse and his mother creates a potential conflict \nof interest because his relationship with them is sufficiently close to raise a security \nconcern about his desire to assist family members in Iraq by providing sensitive or \nclassified information. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his spouse and strong affection for his mother and their \nrelationships with family members living in Iraq to raise the issue of potential foreign \npressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b) and 7(d) apply, and further inquiry \nis necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                             \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) have limited applicability. Applicant traveled to Iraq and \nvisited his family in 2000. Applicant has frequent contact with his spouse, who lives with \nhim, and infrequent contact with his mother, who lives in Iraq. Applicant has not \nestablished his wife has infrequent contacts with her family members living in Iraq. He \nhas deep affection for his mother, and the infrequency of his contacts with her does not \ncompletely mitigate security concerns. AG \u00b6 8(a) has some partial applicability because \nit is his spouse and mother, and not Applicant, who have the extensive contacts with \nfamily in Iraq. Because of his spouse and mother\u2019s connections to Iraq, Applicant is not \nable to fully meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships \nwith his relatives who are Iraq citizens] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has established that \n\u201c[he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d In \n1976, Applicant emigrated from Iran to the United States to flee Saddam Hussein\u2019s \npersecution. In 1991, Applicant became a U.S. citizen, and in 1998, his spouse became \na U.S. citizen. His three children are U.S. citizens. Applicant and his spouse have \nsubstantial U.S. property, and they do not have any property or investments in Iraq. \nMost importantly, he has served in Iraq with U.S. Armed Forces in a combat zone.  He \nhas shown his patriotism, loyalty and fidelity to the United States.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with his spouse and mother and \nthrough them with their families in Iraq. His spouse and mother frequently communicate \nwith family living in Iraq. Some family members have employment with municipal \ngovernments in Iraq. There is no evidence; however, that terrorists, criminals, the Iraqi \ngovernment, or those conducting espionage have approached or threatened Applicant \nor his family in Iraq or that Iraqi officials have asked Applicant or his family for classified \nor sensitive information. As such, there is a reduced possibility that Applicant or \nApplicant\u2019s family would be targets for improper Iraqi coercion or exploitation. While the \ngovernment does not have any burden to prove the presence of such evidence, if such \nrecord evidence was present, Applicant would have a very heavy evidentiary burden to \novercome to mitigate foreign influence security concerns.   \n \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                             \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(d), and 8(e) do not apply. The U.S. Government has not encouraged \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with family members living in Iraq. Applicant is not required to \nreport his contacts with family members living in Iraq. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) partially applies because Applicant has no interest in property or bank \naccounts in Iraq. This mitigating condition can only fully mitigate AG \u00b6 7(e), which \nprovides, \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in \nany foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections through his spouse and mother to family living in \nIraq are less significant than his strong connections to the United States. His \nconnections to the United States taken together are sufficient to fully overcome the \nforeign influence security concerns under Guideline B.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and B in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under this guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere are some facts supporting a foreign influence security concern because of \nApplicant\u2019s connections to Iraq. Applicant and his spouse live in the same household, \nand both of them were born in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s mother, four brothers, his father-in-law, \nand his sister are still residents and citizens of Iraq. He traveled to Iraq and visited his \nmother and possibly other family members in 2000. His spouse may have frequent \ncommunications with her family members living in Iraq.   \n  \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iraq must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in Iraq, as well as the dangers existing in Iraq.4 Iraq is a very \ndangerous place because of violence from insurgents and terrorists. Insurgents and \nterrorists continue to threaten the government of Iraq, the interests of the United States, \nU.S. Armed Forces, and those who cooperate and assist the United States. Applicant \nrecognizes his work with the U.S. Armed Forces endangers his family living in Iraq. The \nUnited States and Iraq are allies in the war on terrorism and the United States is \ncommitted to the establishment of a free and independent government in Iraq. Iraq and \nthe United States have close relationships in diplomacy and trade.      \n \nThe circumstances tending to support approval of a clearance for Applicant are \nmore significant. In 1976, Applicant fled Iraq and Iran and settled in the United States. In \n1991, Applicant became a U.S. citizen. His spouse, who was also born in Iraq, became \na U.S. citizen in 1998. Their three children are U.S. citizens. Applicant returned to Iraq \nand served with U.S. Armed Forces as a linguist/translator from 2005 to 2007. He \nvolunteered to go on hundreds of dangerous patrols as part of his translator duties. \nReliable military personnel serving with him in Iraq laud his duty performance and \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. He is 54 or 55 years old. He is mature and \nresponsible. He has significantly greater contacts or connections with the United States \nthan with Iraq. He has infrequent direct contacts with his relatives living in Iraq. He does \nnot own property in Iraq. When he and his spouse were naturalized as U.S. citizens, \nthey swore allegiance to the United States. He has often put himself in harm\u2019s way, \nworking alongside U.S. Armed Forces on numerous operations. He has made \nsignificant contributions to national security, fully aware of the risks to himself and his \nfamily. All these circumstances demonstrate that Applicant will recognize, resist, and \nreport any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group at coercion or \nexploitation. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). Applicant\u2019s \nstrong connections to the United States and especially to his U.S. family, community \nand his employment as a translator in a combat zone establish \u201csuch deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d See Discussion of AG \u00b6 8(b), supra at \npages 11-12. \n \nAfter weighing the evidence of Applicant\u2019s connections to Iraq and to the United \nStates, and all the facts in this decision, I conclude he has carried his burden of \nmitigating the personal conduct and foreign influence security concerns. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d5 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, all the evidence in this decision, and my interpretation of my responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \n4 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion). \n  \n5See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                             \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:    \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.k: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 37 year old employee of a defense contractor. He is married with five children. As of February 21, 2008, applicant was indebted to U.S. Department of Education (DOE) on account of a defaulted student loan in the amount of $47,159.85. In February 2008, prior to the issuance of the SOR, applicant contacted the DOE about establishing a repayment plan. An agreement was reached, effective March 17, 2008, requiring applicant to make monthly payments of $385.00. As of June 10, 2008, applicant has, pursuant to the agreement, made three monthly payments of $385.00. In an October 2007 Questionnaire For Sensitive Positions (QFSP), applicant indicated he incurred the debt in June 2003 and stated the following: I have been paying consistently on my student [loan] for two years and currently I have been informed that I\u2019m still in default. Have worked out payment plan and have been paying for two year[s] straight out of my check. From the evidence in the FORM, it appears that applicant incurred the student loan debt well before 2003. Since 2003, he has made sporadic payments, either voluntarily or through wage garnishment, to the student loan creditor. During an October 2007 interview with an OPM investigator, applicant stated his unemployment and/or underemployment prevented him from repaying his student loan.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 9, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Decision by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel issued a\nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 15, 2008. Applicant filed a response to the\nFORM in June 2008. The case was assigned to me on June 23, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n\n2\nRulings on Procedure\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by deleting\nallegations 1.a. and 1.b. and replacing them with the following:\nYou are indebted to the Department of Education on a defaulted student\nloan account, in the approximate amount of $47,002.97. As of March 25,\n2008, this debt has not been paid.\nThe motion is granted and the SOR is so amended.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37 year old employee of a defense contractor. He is married with\nfive children.\nAs of February 21, 2008, applicant was indebted to U.S. Department of\nEducation (DOE) on account of a defaulted student loan in the amount of $47,159.85.\nIn February 2008, prior to the issuance of the SOR, applicant contacted the DOE\nabout establishing a repayment plan. An agreement was reached, effective March 17,\n2008, requiring applicant to make monthly payments of $385.00. As of June 10, 2008,\napplicant has, pursuant to the agreement, made three monthly payments of $385.00.\nIn an October 2007 Questionnaire For Sensitive Positions (QFSP), applicant\nindicated he incurred the debt in June 2003 and stated the following:\nI have been paying consistently on my student [loan] for two years and\ncurrently I have been informed that I\u2019m still in default. Have worked out\npayment plan and have been paying for two year[s] straight out of my\ncheck.\nFrom the evidence in the FORM, it appears that applicant incurred the student\nloan debt well before 2003. Since 2003, he has made sporadic payments, either\nvoluntarily or through wage garnishment, to the student loan creditor.\nDuring an October 2007 interview with an OPM investigator, applicant stated his\nunemployment and/or underemployment prevented him from repaying his student loan.\nBefore he joined his current employer in August 2007, applicant had been\nemployed as a public school teacher where his final annual salary was $34,339.00. He\ncurrently earns $62,500.00 from his defense contractor employer. In addition, he has\ntwo part  time jobs which provide him with at least an additional $10,000.00 in annual\nincome.\nNumerous individuals submitted letters in support of applicant. In general,\napplicant is described as an honest, hard working family man.\n\n3\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\n\n4\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of being unable to\npay his student loan debt. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are applicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d This mitigation condition is not\napplicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\npresented credible evidence that from about 2001 to about August 2007, his income\nwas insufficient to repay his student loan and support his wife and children. It appears\nthat this was not due to a lack of trying as his QFSP indicates he worked two other jobs\nwhile employed as a public school teacher. This mitigating condition is applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. This mitigation condition applies as\napplicant has reached a repayment agreement with the creditor, has lived up to that\nagreement, and now appears to have sufficient income to continue with the agreed\nupon payments until the debt is satisfied.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Although\napplicant could have reached out to the DOE sooner than he did, he did establish a\nrepayment plan acceptable to the creditor. This mitigating condition is applicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2.c., the ultimate\n\n5\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has had great difficulty\nrepaying a student loan debt. This does not appear to be a case where an applicant\ntook the money and decided to just ignore the obligation to repay it. Rather, it appears\nthat his failure to repay the debt as he had agreed was based on the simple fact that,\nafter providing the necessities for his wife and children, he did not have the funds to\nrepay it. Since being hired by his current employer in 2007 at a salary almost twice as\nmuch as his previous school teacher salary, he has had the financial means to repay his\nstudent loan debt, and he has begun to do so. Based on his excellent work ethic, and\nthe very favorable character reference letters received into evidence, I conclude that in\nall likelihood, applicant will continue to make his regular payments to the DOE until his\ndebt is satisfied. Under the circumstances, I conclude applicant successfully mitigated\nthe security concerns arising from Guideline F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

MacKinnon, Deputy Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 27, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 21, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person\nanalysis is erroneous; whether the Judge\u2019s application of the Guideline F mitigating conditions is\nerroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, and\ncontrary to law.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nApplicant is a business operations manager for a Defense Department Contractor.  He began\nworking for the company three years ago, following completion of law school.\nIn the late 1990s Applicant worked for a credit and financial company.  Although he thought\nhe was going to be a financial and investment counselor, he was, in fact, more of an insurance\nsalesman.  He received little income from commissions.  For six to eight months he attempted to\ndevelop a client base from lists of names which the company provided him.  This too was\ninsufficiently remunerative, so he resigned.  Due to his insufficient income while working for this\ncompany, Applicant paid his living expenses with credit cards.  He also used credit cards to pay the\ncosts of various licensing examinations he had taken.\nSubsequently, Applicant began working for an information technology (IT) company.\nAlthough he was able to pay his expenses, the company laid him off.  He took a temporary position,\nwhich lasted for one month, and another in a different city.  Applicant realized that this latest\nemployer \u201chad problems\u201d and that the job would not last.  Decision at 3.  Therefore, he decided to\nattend law school.  He graduated in 2005.  \nFollowing his first job loss, Applicant realized that he would have difficulty paying off his\ndebts.  He contacted the credit card companies to develop a repayment plan, but \u201cthey refused to\nwork with him.\u201d  Id.  He got in touch with a debt management company, which developed a plan for\nhim to repay his debts.  However, his employment was temporary and he lacked a steady salary, so\nhe declined to sign a contract with the company.  \u201cHe decided not to make his credit card payments\nuntil his employment situation stabilized.  He made his last payments on the five credit card debts\nalleged in the SOR around March 2001.  He has not sought any additional credit counseling.\u201d  Id.\nThe Judge noted that the majority of the debts on the SOR are no longer listed on his credit reports.\nApplicant acknowledges that these debts are his and that they are unpaid.    \n\n3\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\n\nSee, for example, Government Exhibit 2, Answers to Interrogatories, which includes a summary of Applicant\u2019s\n1\npersonal subject interview.  In this document he is reported as saying to the interviewer \u201cSubject does not intend to pay\nthe amount owed on all of the accounts that became late around 2001.  The subject is waiting for the seven-year period\nof owing money to those delinquent accounts to come to a close.  The subject . . . has read on the website of the Federal\nTrade Commission that there is a time limit on the statute of limitations.  Once an account is sold to a creditor, the\ncreditor cannot legally charge anyone for the amount in question.\u201d   The Judge acknowledged that Applicant had not\nsought bankruptcy protection but characterized the running of the statute of limitations as \u201canother legally acceptable\nmethod for eliminating old, unpaid debt.\u201d  Decision at 11.  Neither the authority cited by the Judge, nor the record,\nsupport a conclusion that bankruptcy, which entails the possibility of some repayment to creditors, is of the same security\nsignificance as a decision not to pay debt.\nSee, e.g., Tr. at 44, in which Applicant acknowledges that his actions in response to his debts may not have\n2\nbeen responsible.  \n4\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nIn holding in favor of Applicant, the Judge relied in large measure upon her conclusion that\nenforcement of the credit card debts reflected in the SOR was barred by the statute of limitations.\nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that the record does not contain sufficient information as\nto the terms of the various credit card contracts so as to permit a reasoned determination as to which\nstate\u2019s statute of limitations applies.  As a consequence, Department Counsel argues, the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis is merely speculative.  While this argument has merit, more to the point is the question of\nwhether the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had met his burden of persuasion as to\nmitigation.  \nThe security concern raised by Guideline F is as follows: \u201cFailure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise question about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d   Directive\n\u00b6 E2.18.  The Board notes the Judge\u2019s findings, and record evidence, to the effect that Applicant had\na sporadic employment history in the late 1990s and early 2000s, during at least part of which time\nhe paid his living expenses, as well as expenses associated with certain licensing exams, with credit\ncards.  This fact alone could cause a reasonable person to question Applicant\u2019s judgment.  Of course,\nthe Judge is bound to consider all of the record evidence, including evidence as to the nature, extent,\nand duration of an applicant\u2019s debts.  See, e.g., Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. (A clearance decision is \u201cbased\non the hearing record.\u201d) Applicant claimed, for example, that some of the debts attributed to him\nwere not legitimately his, although he provided little corroboration for this assertion.  However, in\nthis case Applicant appears to have relied upon the statute of limitations as a means of addressing\nhis debt rather than to take affirmative steps such as working with the debt management company,\nseeking bankruptcy protection, etc.   The Judge\u2019s lengthy discussion of the societal policy underlying\n1\nthe statute of limitations does not explain why, under the facts of this case, Applicant\u2019s decision not\nto pay his creditors demonstrates good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability, which is at the heart\nof the Guideline F security concern.   Viewed in light of the entire record, the evidence which\n2\nApplicant presented does not support a conclusion that he has met his burden of persuasion as to\n\nDepartment Counsel notes that there is ample precedent to make the Judge aware that her analysis and\n3\napplication of the statute of limitations in a Guideline F case was erroneous.  Indeed, this case is the fifth wherein the\nBoard has had to discuss the same error by the same Judge.  See ADP Case No. 06-14616 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2007),\nISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008), ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008), and\nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2008).   No benefit accrues from persistent disregard of agency policy\nand a superior tribunal.  \n5\nmitigation.

However, his employment was temporary and he lacked a steady salary, so he declined to sign a contract with the company. \u201cHe decided not to make his credit card payments until his employment situation stabilized.

On May 27, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 5, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing on June 20, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. DOHA received the request on June 23, 2008. Department Counsel was\nOctober 21, 2008\n\nResponse to SOR and attachments.\n1\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application) at 6, 12, 13; Tr. 27, 98. \n2\nResponse to SOR at 2-3; Tr. 22, 41-43, 87-94.\n3\n2\nprepared to proceed on July 21, 2008, and I received the case assignment on July 25,\n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 4, 2008, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on September 3, 2008. The government offered three exhibits (GE), 1\nthrough 3, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\nand one witness testified on his behalf. He submitted 13 exhibits (AE), A through M,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed at\nthe conclusion of the hearing. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nSeptember 11, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1. f, and 1.g of the SOR, with limitations. He denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c and 1.e of the SOR. He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n1\nApplicant, who is 35 years old, works as a business operations manager for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. He began work for this company three years ago\nafter graduating from law school. Applicant lives with his longtime girl friend.2\nTen years ago, in 1998, after completing his undergraduate and graduate school\nprograms, Applicant, at age 24, accepted a position with a major credit and financial\ncompany. At the time of his interview, he understood that he would counsel individuals\n(clients) on financial investments and that the company would help him develop the\nnecessary client base. The company required him to take several licensing\nexaminations over a period of six months at his own expense. When he completed\nthese examinations, he began working for the company. He soon learned that his job\nwas not as a financial and investment counselor, but more like that of an insurance\nsalesman. He received a small salary. Most of his income was to come from\ncommissions. Thus, he received little income during his first 12 months of employment.\nDuring this time, he used credit cards to pay his living expenses and the cost of\nlicensing examinations.3\nFor six to eight months, Applicant worked for the company trying to develop a\nclient base from lists of names provided to him by the company at a cost of $7.50 per\nname.  A list of 100 \u201cleads\u201d or potential clients cost $750 and might yield one client.\nApplicant used his credit cards to purchase the lists in an effort to develop his clients.\nBy the summer of 1999, Applicant realized that he was not earning any income and\nwould not earn a living from this job. He evaluated the debt he had incurred and\n\nId.\n4\nTr. 23-24, 44-45, 83-86, 95.\n5\nAE L (Credit counseling application); Tr. 25-26, 44-47, 87, 114.\n6\n3\nresigned his position. He continued to use credit cards to pay his living expenses until\nhe started a position with an information technology (IT) company in September 1999.4\nFor the next 16 months, Applicant worked for the IT company. He paid his\nexpenses, including his credit card debts, monthly. In late December 2000, the IT\ncompany laid him off. In March 2001, he started working as a temporary worker for a\nfederal agency. This job lasted one month. In April 2001, he accepted another IT\nposition in another city. He moved and started his new position. Shortly after he began\nhis employment, he realized the company had problems and his job would not last. This\ncompany laid him off at the end of August 2001. Following September 11, 2001, he\nstarted looking for work on the West coast without success. He returned home to the\nEast coast to continue his job search, again without success. Eventually, he decided to\napply for law school. He started law school in August 2002 and graduated three years\nlater. During law school, he worked during the summer.5\nFollowing his first job loss, Applicant realized he would have difficulties paying all\nhis bills, particularly his credit card debt. Initially, he contacted the credit card\ncompanies to develop a manageable repayment plan, but the credit card companies\nrefused to work with him. In March 2001, he contacted a debt management and credit\ncounseling company about debt consolidation. He completed an application form and\nlisted his debts, including his current monthly payments. This company developed a\nplan which required him to pay $800 a month, the same as his then monthly payments\non his credit cards. Because his employment was temporary and he did not have a\nsteady salary, he declined to sign a contract with this company. He decided not to make\nhis credit card payments until his employment situation stabilized. He made his last\npayments on the five credit card debits alleged in the SOR around March 2001.  He has\n6\nnot sought any additional credit counseling.\nApplicant incurred education debt as an undergraduate and in graduate school.\nWhen he returned to law school, these debts were placed in deferment status. He\nborrowed money to pay for law school. After law school, he consolidated most of his\nschool loans into one loan of approximately $70,000. He currently pays $185 a month\non this loan, which will be paid in full in about 25 years. He has two private loans, one\nfor $10,000 and one for $36,000, and one school loan for $2,500. His two private loans\nare tied to market interest rates, which impacts the amount of his monthly payment and\nparticularly, the reduction of the principle. He pays approximately $600 a month on\nthese two loans and $40 a month on the small school loan. As of the hearing date, he\nowed $1,382 on the small loan and $6,220 on the $10,000 private loan. His father co-\nsigned for the $36,000 debt and maintains the papers connected with this debt. He,\n\nAE B (Bank statement); AE E (Documents for $10,000 school loan papers); AE F (Documents for $2,500\n7\nschool loan debt); Tr. 68-81.\nTr. 98-105.\n8\nGE 3 (Credit report dated May 5, 2007).\n9\nIn November 2001, Applicant requested this creditor to cancel its service and send him a final bill. See AE\n10\nA. He does not recall any additional bills from this creditor.\nGE 2 (Interrogatories and answers with attachments including March 5, 2008 credit report) at 8-15; AE C\n11\n(Credit report, dated February 6, 2008); AE K (letter, dated March 31, 2008).\n4\nhowever, pays the monthly payment. His total monthly payment on his school loans is\napproximately $800. He timely makes his payments every month.  \n7\nApplicant currently earns $70,000 a year. His net monthly income is $3,620. His\nmonthly expenses, in addition to his school loan debt, includes rent of $750, utilities of\n$90, car insurance of $100, $400 for food, $80 for public transportation, $100 in\ngasoline for a car, cell phone of $70, and miscellaneous expenses around $200. His\nmonthly expenses total approximately $2,600, including school loans. He has one credit\ncard. He pays the bill in full each month when there are charges. He uses his extra\nmoney to pay additional money towards his school loan debt. He lives with his girlfriend\nwho shares household expenses with him.8\nThe credit report dated May 5, 2007 shows the seven unpaid debts listed in the\nSOR. It also reflects that Applicant disputed the $13,124 debt listed in SOR allegation\n1.a.; that the debts listed in SOR allegations 1.c and 1.g were sold to another lender;\nand that the debt listed in SOR allegation 1.d is closed after being charged off.9\nApplicant submitted two credit reports. The first credit report in February 2008\nidentifies accounts opened as early as 1992 and reported to the credit reporting\nagencies beginning in 1999. This report lists two unpaid debts, one for $334 (SOR\nallegation 1.b) and another for $54 (SOR allegation 1.e). The remaining debts listed in\nthe SOR are not listed in this credit report.  The second credit report in March 2008\nshows that Applicant challenged the $334 debt and that this debt is now a zero\nbalance.  It also shows that Applicant challenged the $54 debt, which remains unpaid.\n10\nAll the remaining debts listed in the SOR are not listed in this credit report, which shows\naccounts with no activity since 1998. Even though the remaining SOR debts are no\nlonger listed on this credit, Applicant acknowledges the debts are his and unpaid. He\nalso admitted that he had a contract with the credit card companies.11\nApplicant\u2019s division manager recommends him for a security clearance. Applicant\nhas proven to be an honest and trustworthy person. Applicant handled confidential\ncorporate and business-sensitive information honestly and with candor. Applicant is a\ndiligent and conscientious worker who can be trusted. His supervisor wants him to\nassume more leadership responsibilities.

See ISCR Case No.\n07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). The Supreme Court\nin United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667.m 690 (198) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 (1974), the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\n5\ntestified that they live within their financial means. She describes their lifestyle as\nnormal to conservative. Applicant also presented documentation that indicates he has\ninvested some money in an effort to earn money to pay his school debts.12\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n13\n\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d And, in United States v. First City\nNational Bank, this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the court should make\nan independent determination of the issues\u201d and should \u201cnot . . . give any special weight to\nthe [prior] determination of\u201d the administrative agency.\n(internal footnotes omitted). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2007), the Appeal Board criticized\nthe administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and then\ndecided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations and\nultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes witness\ncredibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-11(App. Bd. Aug. 25,\n2006)(Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to reverse hearing-level\njudicial decisions and recommends remanding cases to resolve material, prejudicial error) and ISCR Case\nNo. 07-03307 (App. Bd. Sept. 29, 2008).\n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant credit card debt between 1998 and\n2001. He stopped paying this debt in early 2001 and it remains unpaid. The evidence is\n\n7\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial problems arose in early 2001 when he lost his job. He had accumulated\nsignificant credit card debt with his first job after college, in part based on\nmisrepresentations made to him about his earning potential by his employer. When he\nrealized the financial problems being created by this job, he quit. There is very little\nlikelihood he will ever take a job under these circumstances in the future. I find that\nsome of his debt problems occurred under such unusual circumstances which are\nunlikely to recur, and concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment are not raised. This mitigating condition partially applies. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of\nthe financial problems began with his first job after college. After quitting this job, he\nfound other employment. His second job provided sufficient income for him to pay his\nmonthly bills, including his credit cards. However, this employer laid him off at the end of\n2000. When he lost this job, he contacted a credit counseling agency about\nconsolidating his debts into a smaller monthly payment. This company presented him\nwith an unworkable plan. He also contacted the credit card companies, which refused to\nwork with him. Between January 2001 and August 31, 2001, he worked six months at\ntwo different jobs. His third job lasted about five months before he was again laid off in\nAugust 2001, just prior to the events of September 11, 2001. Over the next year, he\nunsuccessfully sought employment in the IT industry. The loss of two jobs in less than\none year is a circumstance beyond Applicant\u2019s control. He tried to consolidate his debt\ninto a manageable monthly payment through the credit card company and a credit\ncounseling agency, without success. The refusal of the credit card companies and the\ncredit counseling company to work with him is also beyond his control. He acted\nresponsibly under these circumstances in 2001. I find this mitigating condition\napplicable. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). This mitigating condition has some\napplicability because Applicant sought credit counseling when his problems began in\n2001, although he has not sought recent credit counseling for these old debts. Similarly,\nAG & 20(d) may apply where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ This mitigating condition is\npartially applicable because Applicant pays his current debts.\n\n8\nFinally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue\u201d, he could mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns un AG \u00b6 20(e).  Applicant\nchallenged the two small debts and the debt in SOR allegation 1.a. As a result of his\nchallenges, the $334 debt is shown as a zero balance and thus, resolved. The large\ncredit card debt no longer appears on his credit report, and from this, I draw the\ninference that he successfully challenged this debt. The $54 remains unpaid. Since the\nrecord contains no documentation which reflects that Applicant challenged the\nremaining debts listed in the SOR, the absence of these debts from the 2008 credit\nreports does not establish that he challenged the debts and his challenge resulted in the\nremoval of the debts from his credit reports. This mitigating condition is applicable to\nSOR allegations 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nIn reaching a conclusion in this case, I considered the potentially disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this\ncase. When these problems first began, Applicant was a young man, just out of college.\nHe had little experience with long-term financial matters and job instability. (See AG &\n2(a)(4).) He accumulated significant debt for a variety of reasons, including two job\nlosses, a poor job market, and misrepresentation about the source of his income and\nhis earning capacity by his first employer in 1998. These circumstances were largely\nbeyond his control. (See AG & 2(a)(2).) After he lost his job in late 2000, he tried to work\nwith the credit companies to develop a reasonable repayment plan. When the credit\ncard companies refused, he sought help from a debt counseling company. This effort\nalso proved fruitless. After he received no help from these sources, he decided to stop\npaying his credit card debt because he lacked sufficient financial resources due to\n\nApplicant has placed money in an investment fund with a goal of earning more money to pay his debt. W hile\n14\nit is his choice on how to repay his debt, this money would pay his two small education loans immediately,\nwhich would then allow him more money monthly to pay his other loans.\nIt appears that Applicant defaulted on these debts while living in jurisdiction A, which has a three-year Statute\n15\nof Limitations for contract actions. However, since he moved twice to two different jurisdictions shortly after\nlosing his first IT position in late 2000, the four-year Statute of Limitations for contract actions in these\njurisdictions may apply to his default.\nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) at 4, the Appeal Board addressed the meaning of\n16\n\u201cgood faith effort\u201d in the following manner:\nIn order to qualify for application of [this mitigating condition] an applicant must present\nevidence showing either a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good\nfaith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term\n\u201cgood faith\u201d. However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good faith \u201crequires a\nshowing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and\nadherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more that show that he\nor she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit\nof [this mitigating condition]. (internal citations omitted).\n9\nunreliable employment. He acted reasonably under these circumstances in 2001. Since\ndefaulting on these debts, Applicant has acted responsibly towards his finances. From\nAugust 2001 through August 2005, Applicant lived within his limited resources,\nmanaging his monthly expenses without incurring any new credit card debt.  During this\ntime, he lacked extra funds to pay his old, overdue credit card debts. He did incur\nadditional educational debt while in law school, which he now timely pays. He has\nchanged both his attitude and behavior about his finances. He does not accumulate\nunnecessary debt; rather, he pays his bills every month, including his significant\neducational debt. He lives conservatively and has developed financial goals for\nhimself.14\nThe four large, unpaid credit card debts in SOR allegations 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g\nare barred by the Statute of Limitations under state law.  When Applicant contracted\n15\nwith the credit card companies, he agreed to repay the monies paid to his creditors by\nthe credit card companies. He acknowledged this contract at the hearing. When he\nstopped making the monthly payments on his credit cards, he breached his contract\nwith the credit card companies. At this point, the credit card companies had the right to\nfile a civil suit for breach of contract for monies due and owing and seek a judgment\nagainst him for the monies due and owing. None of the credit card companies exercised\nits right to file a civil action and obtain a judgment, which is good for many years in most\njurisdictions. In so choosing, the credit card companies allowed their legal rights to\nexpire under the applicable Statute of Limitations. \nThe Appeal Board has held that debts eliminated by the Statute of Limitations or\nbankruptcy do not reflect a good faith effort to pay past due debts.  I agree. The Appeal\n16\nBoard has also held that absent an explicit act of Congress, the government is not\n\nThe Appeal Board has cited several cases indicating federal agencies need not give full faith and credit to\n17\nstate legislatures and court decisions as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738. See ISCR Case No. 04-05712 at 8-10\n(App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006). The cases cited in this case are distinguished in a separate opinion. Id. at 18-20.\nFor example, Congress has determinated that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) must collect unpaid taxes\n18\nwithin a specific period of time. Under federal law, the IRS must prepare and file an assessment of income\ntax it believes due within three years after the tax return is filed. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(a). Once an\nassessment is complete, it has 60 days to give notice to the person liable and a demand for payment of the\ntax due. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6303(a). Once the notice and demand are made, a lien in favor of the United States\nautomatically arises. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321. The IRS must file a levy or institute court proceedings within 10\nyears after the tax assessment to collect the tax lien. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2602(a)(1); United States v. Galletti,\n541 U.S. 114, 119 (2004). The running of the statute of limitations is tolled during a bankruptcy proceeding,\nsee United States v. Doe, 438 F.Supp.2d (S.D. Ohio 2006), by agreements (made before Dec. 20, 2000), see\nUnited States v. Ryals, 480 F.3d 1101, 1106(11th Cir. 2007), or while an offer in compromise (made on or\nafter Dec. 31, 1999) is pending. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6404(a) provides for abatement of an assessment when it is\nuncollectible. This is just one of many federal statutes which provide a specific time for parties to file an action\nfor claims.\n10\nbound by state law in carrying out its functions and responsibilities.  Thus, concerning\n17\nthe use of Statutes of Limitations or bankruptcy to show good faith effort, the Appeal\nBoard has said:\nThe fact that Applicant may be insulated from collection actions with\nrespect to a number of her debts due to the running of her state\u2019s statue of\nlimitations is of little mitigative value. The Board has previously noted that\nreliance on a statute of limitations does not constitute a good faith effort to\nresolve financial difficulties. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App.\nBd. Jul. 20, 2005); See ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 2-3 (App. Bd. March\n27, 2003). \nIn light of this view, the Appeal Board considers legally unenforceable, unpaid debt as\n\u201ccontinuing and ongoing\u201d even after a creditor is barred by a Statute of Limitations from\ncollecting the unpaid debt. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008). I\nrespectfully disagree with the Appeal Board\u2019s characterization of legally unenforceable,\nunpaid debt.\nThe United States Congress and all 50 state legislatures have enacted statutes\nof limitations for various civil claims and even criminal actions.  By so doing, Congress\n18\nand the state legislature made an active determination that the government, individuals\nand corporations must exercise their legal rights within a specific period of time. If not,\neach waives its right to seek recovery of their losses or claims. A State Court of Appeals\nsuccinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of\nlimitations:\nStatutes of Limitations embody important public policy considerations in\nthat they stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by\ngiving security and stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy\nconsideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law\n\nThe Appeal Board gives little weight to the Statute of Limitations, a fundamental part of the American Legal\n19\nsystem.\nApplicant did not argue that he was waiting for the Statute of Limitations to run on these debts, although by\n20\nthe time he graduated from law school, he clearly understood the debts would be barred by these statutes at\nsome point in time. He did indicate that he was waiting for the old debts to drop from his credit report, a factor\nwhich helps improves his credit worthiness, but has no impact on his security worthiness or the ability of the\ncreditors to collect these debts under state law. \nI note that had the creditors timely sought obtain a judgment against, the creditor had the burden of\nproving the actual debts owed. If it could not produce reliable and accurate documentation of the debts owed\nby  Applicant, the courts would dismiss the action for  lack of sufficient evidence to establish the actual debt\nowed as listed on the credit report. A state court would not view a listing of a debt on a credit report as\nconclusive proof that a debt is owed.\n11\nto promote and achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of\nlimitations provide potential defendants with certainty that after a set\nperiod of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on\ntheir rights.  Statutes of Limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial\nsystem.19\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted). By operation of law, Applicant\u2019s creditors cannot\nseek to recover any of his unpaid debts as the debts are no longer due and owing. \nApplicant did not file for bankruptcy in 2001, a legal method to eliminate unpaid\ndebt, whether it is current or old. Had he filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and the court\ndischarged these debts, the SOR debts would be less significant because the debts\nwould have been eliminated through a different legally acceptable method. The issue of\nhis security worthiness would focus on how he had managed his income and expenses\nafter the bankruptcy court discharged his debts. Applicant decided not to pay his debts,\ninitially intending to pay his credit cards when he returned to full-time stable\nemployment. Over the next four years, Applicant did not work full-time either because\nhe could not find a job or because he was in school full-time. As a student, he worked in\nthe summers, which limited his earnings in a year. During these four years, he managed\nhis limited resources and lived within his monthly income. He did not incur new unpaid\ncredit card debt, nor did he make payments on his outstanding debts as he lacked\nsufficient income. When he returned to full-time, steady work in 2005, his creditors were\nbarred from collecting his unpaid debts under the applicable Statute of Limitations,\nanother legally acceptable method for eliminating old, unpaid debt.  The legal effect of\n20\na bankruptcy discharge or the Statute of Limitations is the same - legal  liability for\npayment of old, unpaid debts is gone.\nUnder relevant state law, all the creditors for the debts listed in the SOR are\nbarred from collecting these unpaid debts. Thus, Applicant does not legally owe this\nmoney and the creditors know this. Applicant\u2019s collection barred, unpaid debts are\nsignificant. The issue in this case is whether these old, unpaid debts create a security\n\nIn any other legal venue, these debts can not be used to harm an individual.\n21\nIf Applicant has stopped using drugs or consuming alcohol to excess seven years ago, and he had\n22\nestablished a track record for responsible behavior in his daily life, he would have mitigated any security\nconcerns the government would have about his past use of drugs and alcohol, particularly if this conduct\noccurred when he was young and foolish. In alcohol and drug cases, an Applicant may mitigate his young and\nfoolish conduct by demonstrating he has matured and is acting as a responsible adult. The same maturity and\nchange in behavior should be a relevant factor in financial cases. \n12\nrisk, not whether the debts are collectible or not. For purposes of security worthiness,\nApplicant cannot be pressured, coerced, or exploited to reveal classified information\nbecause of his old, unpaid and past due debts. However, his past conduct concerning\nthe resolution of these debts is relevant. When he decided to stop paying the credit card\ndebts in 2001, Applicant intended to start paying his debts once he obtained steady\nemployment. He did not anticipate it would be more than four years before he would\nagain work full-time. For most new law school graduates, full-time employment does not\nequal a high paying salary. He currently earns a reasonable income, but not excessive\nincome given the high cost of where he lives. He is not employed in a high paying legal\njob and must prioritize the payment of his expenses. His income pays his current school\ndebts and living expenses, which are his top priorities. He does not want to fall behind in\nhis financial obligations as in the past. \nSince defaulting on his debts seven years ago, Applicant has not incurred any\nnew and unpaid credit card debt. He has accrued significant educational debt, which he\ntimely pays each month and has for several years. He has a seven-year track record for\nliving within his monthly income. He does not live extravagantly and manages his\nincome responsibly. I recognize that he has not made any effort to pay these old debts,\nwhich are no longer listed on his credit reports and are not legally collectible because\nthe debts are barred by the Statute of Limitations. Given his fiscal management for the\nlast seven years and the lack of new, unpaid credit card debts, the legal effect of the\nStatute of Limitations is a factor I must consider in making my decision, although it is not\n the only or deciding factor in my decision.  His failure to pay these time barred debts,\n21\nwhich occurred as a result of circumstances beyond his control seven years ago, does\nnot reflect on his current reliability and trustworthiness because he has demonstrated\nfiscal responsibility for the last seven years and did prior to losing two jobs in less than a\nyear. Except for his lack of ability to pay these debts in the past, Applicant has acted in\na fiscally responsible manner with his income and payment of his expenses. Based on a\nreview of all the facts in this case, his old, unpaid credit card debts are not sufficient to\nraise a security concern. I find that he has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns\nunder Guideline F.  (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \n22\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \n\n13\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Monte Alan Rich, Esq. \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on April 3, 2007.\nOn June 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006.\nFebruary 9, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 21, 2008 and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on October 20, 2008.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 7, 2008, for a hearing on November 21,\n2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered five exhibits (Exhs 1-5) that were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted one exhibit (Exh. A) that\nwas admitted without objection. He testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 4, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to\nkeep the record open for 30 days to submit additional evidence. Three additional\ndocuments (Exhs. B - D) were submitted and accepted in evidence without objection\n.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor since July 2006\nworking as a senior network technician. He was honorably discharged from the Army as\na private first class in 1997 after four years of active duty (Tr. 14). He had debts that\nraised questions about his continued military service. He filed bankruptcy to prevent his\ndischarge. However, the Army revoked his security clearance because of the delinquent\nfinancial accounts. The revocation resulted in ineligibility to do the job for which he was\ntrained so he left the service. The skills he learned in the Army are those that he has\nused in his civilian employment since his discharge. The debts arose during his\nmarriage when his wife accumulated debts of which he was unaware both during the\nmarriage and sometime thereafter. The marriage was terminated by separation in 1997\nand divorce in 2001.\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all 15 of the financial allegations relating to\napproximately $13,000 in delinquent debts ranging in size from $64 to $2,700 (SOR \u00b6\n1.a.-1.- 1.o.). They arise from medical bills, credit cards, telephone bills, and student\nloans. None of the debts have been paid. One debt for $2,500 (SOR \u00b6 1.g.) from an\napartment rental is in dispute (Tr. 47) but no evidence was offered to show how it was\nbeing disputed. After his discharge from the Army, he was employed by a major telecom\ncorporation until 2000. He was laid off when that industry encountered financial\nproblems. He was largely unemployed in 2001 and 2002 except for unemployment\ncompensation, a few part time jobs, and withdrawals from his 401k account from his\nformer employer. His total income for 2002 was $22,000 (Exh. A). The current debts at\nissue arose during those periods of unemployment and under-employment in 2001 and\n2002 (Tr. 36). He was then living alone, so to lessen his living expenses, he lived with\nhis sister. \nIn March, 2003 he was employed by another telecom until May, 2006. He was\nunemployed for a two month period until he was hired by the predecessor corporation of\nhis present employer. During the three year period of this employment between 2003\nand 2006 when he was not married, he managed his current income without incurring\nadditional debts. He also stated that he contacted creditors to attempt to resolve the\ndebts (Tr. 24). The holders of the larger debts insisted on lump sum payments that he\ncould not pay. No explanation was given for failure to resolve any of the smaller debts. \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s annual salary from his present employment began at $45,000 and is\nnow approximately $54,000. He has a 401(k) account valued at $4,000 from which he\ntook a loan of $1,500 to move to the state where he now resides. He re-married in 2006.\nHe has three children from his first marriage and his wife has six from hers. Two of the\nchildren and one grandchild live with them. The grandchild\u2019s mother is serving with the\nmilitary in Iraq. While they have a large number of children, most are mature and not\nliving at home.\nIn a financial statement (Exh. 2) filed in response to interrogatories in this matter,\nApplicant indicated that he had negative cash flow of $371 per month. Since he filed\nthat statement he has moved to another state with lower living costs and had an\nincrease in his salary. Thus the negative figure does not appear to be accurate although\nan alternate figure was not submitted. His wife is seeking employment which, if\nsuccessful, also will have a positive effect on their income. \nAt the hearing in this matter, Applicant indicated his intention to file bankruptcy\nfor his debts. In the post hearing submission he submitted his Chapter 7 bankruptcy\npetition and other related documents. He also submitted a letter from his lawyer\noutlining the reasons for the filing and the advice he had received from his lawyer and a\nbankruptcy counsel regarding his qualification for bankruptcy, and his decision to file\nunder Chapter 7 (Exhs. B - D). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \"a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.\u201d Applicant accumulated the delinquent debts cited in the SOR several\nyears ago and has not made payments to the creditors even though he was earning a\nsalary for over two years that made some payments possible. Thus, the evidence clearly\nraises these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of mitigating conditions (MC) that could\nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(e) the\nsecurity concern may be mitigated when the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute\nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt that is the cause of the problem, and provides\n\n5\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue. He disputes one debt but provided no documentation of the\ndispute. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Most of Applicant=s financial\nproblems arose over six years ago but very little has been done to resolve them. Thus,\nthe debts are considered to be recent and ongoing. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b) the disqualifying condition could be mitigated if the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control through\nloss of employment, separation or divorce, and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances. In this matter, it appears that his first group of debts during his\nmilitary service was related to his separation and divorce or at least was part of the\ncause of the divorce. However those debts are not at issue in this matter. The debts at\nissue here arose eight years ago during the nearly two years of unemployment and\nunderemployment. That could be grounds for mitigation but there is inadequate evidence\nthat he acted responsibly from the time he obtained employment in 2003. None of the\ndebts have been settled or paid during that time. No evidence was offered to show proof\nof any discussions, correspondence, or negotiation with any creditor.\nEvidence that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is\na potentially mitigating condition under AG & 20(c). Applicant is receiving counseling but\nit is related to filing for bankruptcy which, if successful, will result in the elimination of his\ndebts. \nAG & 20(d) could apply if the evidence shows the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. While it not necessary that\nall of the delinquent debts be resolved for mitigation to apply, it is necessary that a\nsignificant portion of the debts be settled or paid. Since none of the debts, even two of\nunder $100, have been resolved or even successfully negotiated, I conclude that\nmitigating conditions do not apply. \nApplicant has not been sufficiently diligent in pursuing the problem and now seeks\nto resolve all the delinquent debts through Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Even if bankruptcy is\nfiled or discharged, I must assess the overall history of financial problems (ISCR Case\n98-0445 April 2, 1999). This bankruptcy will be Applicant\u2019s second in the last twelve\nyears. While bankruptcy may place him on a sound financial footing for the future, it is\npremature to grant a security clearance at this time before sufficient time has passed to\nsee if he can manage his finances to remain out of debt. The mitigating conditions are\nnot applicable.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the\nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an\noverall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and\nthe whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwith questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nat this time. I recognize his present expressed intent to resolve these financial issues to\nkeep a security clearance. However, these delinquent debts have been extant for several\nyears, and although he has been employed at a reasonable salary for over five years in\ntwo jobs, none of the listed debts has been paid or settled. Applicant has not mitigated\nthe security concerns arising from these financial considerations. Applicant was\nimpressive in his testimony about his family history and work experience, there is no\nreason that he should not receive a security clearance at some future time but It is\npremature at this time to grant one. \n                          Formal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.- 1.q: Against Applicant\nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is \ngranted. \n \nOn October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline G. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 13 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 2, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 5, 2008, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on January 8, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 3, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nthrough 3. Applicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and two \nwitnesses testified on her behalf. She offered Exhibits (AE) A-G. Department Counsel \ndid not object and they were admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non January 26, 2009.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR except 1.b, which she denied. \nThe admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old, married since 1991, and the mother of three children, \ntwin 10-year-olds and a 12-year-old. She graduated from college with an electrical \nengineering degree in 1988.1  \n \n \nApplicant drank beer in college to the same degree as most other college \nstudents. After graduating from college she drank alcohol casually. After she married \nshe and her husband enjoyed wine tastings and drank wine. Her husband later began \ndrinking scotch. She drank some scotch, but it was not until after her mother-n-law \nmoved in with their family and introduced her to vodka did she begin increasing her \nalcohol consumption.2 \n \n \nDuring 2001 Applicant had a series of stressful events take place in her life. She \nhad previously had a wonderful relationship with her mother-in-law, but when she \nneeded a place to live and came to live with Applicant and her family the relationship \nbecame strained. During this time Applicant\u2019s father was diagnosed with cancer and \ndied nine months later. Applicant also had a long time beloved pet die. These events \nwere in addition to the anxiety she felt after the September 11, 2001, terrorist \nbombings.3  \n \n \nApplicant, her mother-in-law, and husband would have a cocktail/vodka each \nevening after the children were put to bed. Her husband and mother-in-law would get \ntired after consuming the vodka and go to bed. The alcohol tended to energize \nApplicant. Applicant became concerned about her drinking during this time and asked \nher husband and mother-in-law if her drinking was becoming a concern. Both assured \nher she did not have a drinking problem.4  \n \n \nFrom 2001 to 2006, Applicant\u2019s drinking progressed and vodka was her drink of \nchoice. By 2006 she found herself drinking vodka daily and she began hiding her \n \n1 Tr. 23-24. \n \n2 Tr. 24-25. \n \n3 Tr. 25-26. \n \n4 Tr. 26-28. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \ndrinking from her husband. Applicant had a great deal of anxiety in her life. She was \nactive in her children\u2019s school and community. She was struggling with the possibility \nthat she might be an alcoholic. She never drank at work or had any absences from work \ndue to her alcohol consumption. She researched alcohol treatment facilities and \nprograms during this time.5  \n \n \nIn 2006 Applicant\u2019s daughter graduated from 5th grade and Applicant felt \noverwhelmed by her emotions and was worried that if she did not get a handle on her \ndrinking she would be going down a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d She and her husband discussed \nher drinking and the next day she made the decision that she had to take action \nimmediately. On June 29, 2006, she told her husband about her daily alcohol \nconsumption and she entered a treatment program the next day. Her husband fully \nsupported her and went with her to the \u201cintake\u201d processing.6  \n \n \nApplicant selected an intensive outpatient program that requires abstinence. It is \nan eight-week program with 28 sessions spread out over the weeks with the sessions \nlasting three hours. After completion of the program, it is recommended that the patient \nattend at least 70 aftercare sessions to ensure long term recovery. Applicant attended \nmore than 70 sessions. The sessions were once a week for two hours, meeting with 10 \nto 12 other people along with an addiction counselor. Also part of the aftercare \ntreatment is to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), which she did. Applicant consistently \nattended her group sessions that were located at a significant distance from her house. \nShe liked the \u201chome group\u201d she participated in and was comfortable there. Applicant \nparticipated with her \u201chome group\u201d from June 2006 to July 2008.7 \n \nOn September 17, 2007, Applicant was taking care of her neighbor\u2019s dog and \nwas in their house. She noticed a bottle of vodka. She put some of the vodka in her soft \ndrink and drank it. She felt so badly that she immediately contacted her AA sponsor and \nthe alcohol treatment facility. She reenrolled for another ten sessions of the outpatient \nprogram for four weeks. Applicant admitted that prior to her relapse from about July \n2007 to September 2007 she had lost regular contact with her AA sponsor. She felt her \nAA sponsor was too strict and demanding. On the day of her relapse she told her \nsponsor that she was ready to listen to her and asked her to take her back. Her sponsor \ntold her she was glad to have her back.8  \n \nApplicant began attending AA in July 2006 as part of her intensive outpatient \ntreatment requirement. She continued to attend through 2007 and after her relapse in \nSeptember 2007 she increased her attendance to three times a week. In the middle of \n2008, Applicant admitted although she still attended AA the frequency had diminished \n \n5 Tr. 22-31, 57-62. \n \n6 Id. \n \n7 Tr. 31-35, 65-68. \n \n8 Tr. 35-45, 68-75. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \ndue to complacency. On August 13, 2008, while cleaning the garage, Applicant found a \nbottle with a small amount of vodka in it. She drank it. She called her sponsor right away \nand told her of her relapse. She also contacted her treatment facility. She resumed \nattending AA three times a week.9  \n \nApplicant admitted that one of the difficulties she had was when she changed \n\u201chome groups.\u201d She was originally in a group that she felt very comfortable with and the \nmembers were all recovering alcoholics. She switched \u201chome groups\u201d to find one closer \nto her residence and was very unhappy. The group was transitory and had many \nmembers with other addictions. She struggled with participating in this group and was \nemotionally distraught about it. She eventually realized this \u201chome group\u201d was not \nworking for her.10  \n \nAnother part of the intensive outpatient treatment program was for the patient to \ntake Antabuse. Applicant used it during her treatment and has it at home in her \u201ctool \nbox.\u201d The last time she took it was August 2008 after her relapse. She said she took it \n\u201cjust in case\u201d for a period of a few weeks.11  \n \n \n \nSince her August 2008 relapse she has found an AA \u201chome group\u201d and has \nmade a \u201cservice commitment\u201d to that group. This is a group that she meets with at least \nonce a week and she is accountable to the members of this group. She is active in the \ngroup beyond showing up once a week. Making a \u201cservice commitment\u201d to the group is \na significant milestone in her recovery. She has taken on the responsibility for the set up \nof the meeting. She is accountable to each \u201chome group\u201d members for remaining sober. \nShe attends her AA \u201chome group\u201d weekly. She also attends other AA meetings \nthroughout the week. Her \u201chome group\u201d does not have a \u201ccheck the box\u201d sign in sheet, \nfor those who need to show they are attending due to court orders. This group is \ncommitted to long term sobriety.12  \n \n \nApplicant stated she has been completely through the AA 12-step program twice \nand has started the program again. She is now on steps 6-7 for the third time. She \nstated her sobriety is a life-long commitment and she practices the AA principles in all of \nher affairs. Each time she goes through the 12-step program she learns something \nnew.13  \n \n \nApplicant revealed that she comes from a family of alcoholics, which is what \nmade her suspicious that she might be one too. She confirmed that many of her family \n \n9 Tr. 35-45, 70-75. \n \n10 Tr. 41-45. \n \n11 Tr. 47, 81-84. \n \n12 Tr. 41-45. \n \n13 Tr. 68-79. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nare dead and she believed that although their death certificates did not list alcoholism \nas the cause of death, she is convinced it was a significant contributing factor.14  \n \nApplicant has a strong relationship with her sponsor. Applicant and her sponsor \nemail each other on a daily basis, they talk on the phone, and they have attended AA \nretreats. Applicant has attended four AA retreats.15  \n \n \nApplicant forcefully and credibly testified she would go to any lengths to protect \nher sobriety, including redefining her relationship with God, even if it meant doing things \ndifferently than how she was raised religiously. Applicant stated she is not ashamed of \nher alcoholism except if she did nothing about it.16 \n \n \nApplicant sees a counselor on a weekly basis to help her with dealing with \noverwhelming emotional issues and anxiety. She is on prescribed anti-anxiety and \nantidepressant medication. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law no longer lives with her and her \nhusband is very supportive of her sobriety. As a show of respect and solidarity her \nhusband also refrains from alcohol consumption. There is no alcohol in the house and \nthey do not serve it to guests. He attends a regular monthly poker game and brings ice \ntea to drink to show his support for his wife. Applicant\u2019s children know she is an \nalcoholic. Her husband has sat down with each child individually to discuss his wife\u2019s \nalcoholism and answered any questions or concerns they may have. Her family \nunderstands that sobriety is her first priority. Applicant\u2019s close friends know of her \nalcoholism and all of her family is aware of it. Applicant has an AA bumper sticker on \nher car.17  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sponsor testified on her behalf. She has participated as Applicant\u2019s \nsponsor since October 2006. She is not a therapist, but rather also a recovering \nalcoholic. She has been a sponsor to about 6-7 people in the past, but presently she is \nsponsoring only Applicant. She and Applicant have gone through the 12-step study. \nThey have a close relationship, have gone on retreats together, meet once a week, and \nare in contact frequently. She confirmed that when Applicant relapsed she was \ncontacted by Applicant immediately. She also testified that she believes Applicant will \ngo to any lengths for her recovery and to stay sober. Her sponsor also confirmed that \nApplicant is totally willing and committed to her sobriety. She believes Applicant was \nstruggling for a period with her identity as an alcoholic, but has since surrendered and \naccepted her alcoholism. She believes Applicant understands that her sobriety has to \ncome first. She also confirmed that Applicant has strong family support and her \nhusband is an advocate for her recovery.18  \n \n14 Tr. 51. \n \n15 Tr. 65-79. \n \n16 Tr. 44-45. \n \n17 Tr. 47-50, 79-81, 85-104. \n \n18 Tr. 50-79. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nAnother witness testified on behalf of Applicant. This witness is also a recovering \nalcoholic who met Applicant at one of the AA meetings. They shared a room on a 3-day \nAA retreat and got to know each other. She testified that they shared a great deal and \npart of the AA creed is to live an open and honest life, one of integrity and to examine \none\u2019s motives. She believes Applicant is committed to her sobriety. They talk to each \nother frequently and support each other.19 \n \n \nApplicant provided a letter from her mental health counselor who stated she has \nbeen treating her since February 2007.20 She meets with her approximately once a \nweek. She confirmed that Applicant has shown good improvement in her coping skills \nand developed a better insight about her triggers for relapse on alcohol use. She has \nmade significant progress toward improved self esteem, confidence and anxiety \nmanagement. She confirmed that in addition to individual counseling, Applicant has \nbeen actively engaged in AA meetings and has developed healthy interpersonal \nrelationships within the program which is a good prognostic indicator of commitment \nand success. Her counselor commented on Applicant\u2019s brief relapse in August 2008 \nand that she was quick to respond to it. She increased her frequency of AA meeting, \nestablished a service position at her regular meeting, and also requested Antabuse as \nan additional tool. The counselor also noted that Applicant has consistently shown a \ncommitment to treating her dependence on alcohol through her actions and behavior. \nSpecifically she stated: \n \nShe demonstrates a high motivation for exploring all necessary options \nincluding medication treatment. She is also open to therapeutic \nrecommendations I suggest. Her actions demonstrate a dedication and a \ndesire to protect her abstinence and have resulted in an established \npattern of abstinence over the last three years. Based on her behavior, I \nbelieve [Applicant] to be reliable and trustworthy both personally and \nprofessionally.21 \n \nApplicant works about 30 hours a week. She is a committed volunteer at her \nchildren\u2019s schools and their athletic teams. She teaches religious education at her \nchurch. She has been a Girl Scout leader for eight years. She also serves as a foster \ncare giver for a horse rescue organization and is presently caring for a horse. She also \nadopts feral cats and has then neutered or spayed. She volunteers with the Salvation \nArmy through a \u201cDress for Success\u201d service project. Applicant provided character letters \nfrom those serving with her in her volunteer projects. They are aware of her alcoholism \nand attest that she has not demonstrated irresponsible conduct, but rather to the \n \n \n19 Tr. 105-112. \n \n20 AE D. Her mental health professional is a psychiatric nurse practitioner. She has conducted \ninterviews to determine psychiatric diagnosis and makes recommendations for treatment. She is licensed \nto prescribe medication as well as offer counseling services. She also has extensive experience with the \ntreatment of substance abuse disorders.  \n \n21 AE D. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \ncontrary she is a committed and responsible volunteer who they respect and admire.22 \nApplicant also provided copies of her performance appraisals from her employer which \nreflects her consistently outstanding performance.23 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n \n22 AE A, B, C, and G. \n \n23 Tr. 113-117; AE E and F. \n\n \n8 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 including: \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; and  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g. physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; and \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program. \n \nApplicant was drinking everyday and hiding it from her husband. Due to her own \nconcern for her welfare Applicant referred herself for treatment to an alcohol treatment \nprogram. She admitted she was diagnosed by a qualified medical professional as \nalcohol dependent. She successfully completed the program, but had a relapse when \nshe consumed a small amount of alcohol in August 2008. I find all of the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 including: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser\u201d); and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with a treatment recommendation, such as \nparticipation in meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization \nand has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofession or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a \nrecognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nApplicant referred herself for alcohol treatment because she was concerned about her \nalcohol consumption due to her family history. Applicant acknowledges she is an \nalcoholic. She has not had any alcohol-related incidents. She successfully completed \nthe extensive program, completed after-care beyond what was required or \nrecommended. She participates in AA beyond just attending meetings, but rather has \nmade a service commitment to her \u201chome group\u201d to which she is accountable. She has \na sponsor that she is committed to and who is committed to her. She attends AA \nretreats. She has strong family support. Her family and friends know she is an alcoholic. \nShe readily admitted she had a relapse and immediately took control of the situation by \ngoing back to her treatment facility and attending a refresher, reengaging her sponsor, \nand renewing her commitment to AA.  \n \n \nApplicant has not had any alcohol-related incidents that have prompted her to \nseek treatment. Rather she recognized she had an alcohol problem and committed her \nlife to on-going treatment of that problem, through her commitment to abstinence, her \nconstant reflection through repeatedly working through the 12-step AA program, her \ndaily contact with her sponsor, and her weekly treatment with her counselor. Applicant\u2019s \ncommitment to an alcohol-free life is impressive. She does not just say the right words \nshe follows through with her commitment with action. Applicant did not enroll in a \ntreatment program because she had trouble at work or she had an alcohol-related \noffense, but rather she did it for herself and her family. Her testimony was completely \nhonest, including her comments about her mistakes. She made no attempt to minimize \nor justify her actions. She is completely devoted to her sobriety and recognizes when \nshe needs help from others.  \n \n \nI find mitigating condition (a) applies because Applicant confronted her \nalcoholism and has taking profound and monumental steps to ensure it does not \nbecome an adverse issue in her life. I find because of her actions, it does not cast doubt \non her reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. I also find (b) applies because of \nher acknowledged alcoholism and the steps she has taken to remain abstinent. I find (d) \napplies because of her treatment she has completed and her commitment to AA. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s mental health professional does not appear part of a recognized \n\n \n10 \n \n \nalcohol treatment program, I find her credentials comply with the spirit, if not the letter of \nthe mitigating condition. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 42-year-old \nacknowledged alcoholic. She referred herself for treatment before her alcoholism took \nover her life. She completed treatment and aftercare and regularly attends AA. She is \ntotally committed to her sobriety, despite having short relapses. Applicant is aware of \nthe importance of her sobriety for her self preservation and for her family. She has the \nactive support of her family, friends, and sponsors. She never once wavered in taking \nresponsibility for sobriety and has a committed awareness of all that she must do to stay \nsober. Applicant is an alcoholic, but is also a committed mother, wife, employee, friend, \nand perennial volunteer. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions \nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns arising under the \nguideline for Alcohol Consumption. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department  Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations.   His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on August 1, \n2007. On March 27, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn April 15, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested that his \ncase be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 2, 2008. The FORM contained documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 7.  By letter dated June 3, 2008, a copy of the FORM was \nforwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or \nobjections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the file on June 9, 2008.  His \nresponse was due on July 9, 2008. He submitted three additional documents within the \nrequired time period.  Department Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s submissions. \nOn July 2, 2008, the case was assigned to me for a decision. After reviewing Applicant\u2019s \nsubmissions, I marked them as Applicant\u2019s exhibits (Ex.) A, B, and C and admitted them \nto the record in this case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 62 years old. He and his wife have been married since 1969.  Since \n1997, Applicant has been employed as a test technician by a defense contractor.  He \nhas held a security clearance since 1997. (Item 5.) \n \n \nThe SOR contains 28 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.ab.) The 28 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR \ntotal $76,179. (Item 1.)  Of the 28 allegations of financial delinquency in the SOR, 23 \nwere identified and listed on Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report of March 11, 2008, and five \nwere identified and listed on his credit bureau report of August 23, 2007. (Item 6; Item \n7.) In his Answer to the SOR, dated April 15, 2008, Applicant admitted 27 of the \nallegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.q. and \u00b6\u00b6 1.s. through 1.ab.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nadmitted herein as findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegation at SOR \u00b61.r. and presented a photocopy of the \nface of a personal check in the amount of $1,716.38, dated October 8, 2007, and made \nout to the alleged creditor. He also asserted that the allegation he admitted at \u00b61.n. was \na duplicate of the allegation he admitted at \u00b6 1.e. Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report of \nAugust 23, 2007, lists two accounts with the same creditor for SOR \u00b61.e. and SOR \u00b61.n. \nThe account numbers for the two debts are not the same and do not match. The debt \nalleged at \u00b61.e was referred for collection in June 2004; the debt identified at \u00b6 1.n. was \nreferred for collection in October 2006. (Item 3; Item 7.)  \n \n \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated he had contacted a representative \nof the creditor identified at SOR \u00b6 1.l. and had made an offer to settle the account. He \nfurther stated that the creditor had responded with a counter offer.  He did not indicate \nwhether he and the creditor had reached a settlement agreement. (Ex. A.) \n \n \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant also provided a statement from the creditor \nidentified at \u00b61. z. showing he had paid the past due debt alleged in the SOR and, as of \nApril 11, 2008, his account with that creditor was paid in full. (Ex. B.)  Also in response \nto the FORM, Applicant provided a document which purported to show that a debt of \n$50, alleged at SOR \u00b61.m. as in collection status since July 2004, had been satisfied.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHowever, the document did not show the debt had been satisfied but, instead, showed \na balance due of $30. (Ex. C.) \n \n \nThirteen of Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts were placed for collection in 2004, \nand three of his delinquent accounts were identified as bad debts in 2004. (Item 1, \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.o., 1.p., 1.q., 1.v., 1.ab.)   \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he had applied for credit counseling \nwith his credit union. He further stated that because the credit counselors at the credit \nunion had a heavy work load, they were unable to schedule him for credit counseling \nuntil late in May 2008. Applicant stated that the credit union credit counselors had \nreferred him to an alternative credit counseling service.  In his response to the FORM, \nApplicant reported he had completed one credit counseling session with the alternative \ncredit counseling service.  (Item 4; Ex. A.)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant provided credible documentation to corroborate his \nassertion that one of his debts had been satisfied. In his response to the FORM, \nApplicant asserted he had satisfied a debt for $56, alleged at \u00b6 1.z., that was allegedly \n120 days past due. His Ex. B corroborated Appellant\u2019s assertion that the account was \nsatisfied. The SOR allegation at \u00b6 1.z. is concluded for Applicant. \n \nHowever, as Applicant\u2019s 27 remaining delinquencies demonstrate, he \naccumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unwilling or unable to satisfy his \ncreditors over a considerable period of time. This evidence is sufficient to raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).  \n \nThe financial considerations guideline also includes examples of conditions that \ncould mitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F \n\n \n5 \n \n \nmitigating conditions could apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies. Unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so \nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. (AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be \nmitigated if the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control, such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances \nthat might be applicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control (AG \u00b6 20(c), or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 (d)) Finally, an \napplicant can offer in mitigation documentary evidence to establish that he or she has a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of a past due debt and has taken action to \nresolve the issue. (AG \u00b6 20(e).)   \n \nMany of Applicant=s financial delinquencies arose in calendar year 2004 and \nhave not been satisfied. He offered no explanation for the significant debt which \ncontinues to the present day, a situation that raises concerns about his judgment and \nreliability.   \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied responsibility for the debt alleged at \n\u00b61.r.  As evidence of payment, he offered a photocopy of the face of a personal check \nmade out to the creditor.  He failed to provide evidence that the check was received and \nnegotiated by the creditor. He also failed to provide evidence from the creditor that the \ndebt was satisfied. \n \nApplicant asserted that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. duplicates and repeats the \ndebt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.n.  Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report of August 23, 2007, lists two \naccounts with the same creditor for SOR \u00b61.e. and SOR \u00b61.n. The account numbers for \nthe two debts are not the same and do not match. Applicant provided no documentation \nto corroborate his assertion that the debt alleged at \u00b61.e. was a duplicate of the debt \nalleged at \u00b61.n.  Additionally, Applicant, in his response to the FORM, asserted that Ex. \nC established satisfaction of the debt alleged at \u00b6 1.m., a debt for $50 that had been \nplaced for collection in 2004. However, Applicant\u2019s Ex. C was a request for payment \nfrom the creditor for $30 and failed to establish that the debt of $50 had been satisfied. \n \nApplicant has been steadily employed with his current employer for \napproximately 11 years.  During that time, Applicant has not contacted the majority of \nhis creditors to arrange payment plans or to initiate settlement.  He sought credit \ncounseling only recently, and, in his response to the FORM, he noted he had attended \none session of credit counseling. I conclude that that none of the financial \nconsiderations mitigating conditions fully apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Appellant is a mature person with a \nlifetime of financial experience. He accumulated over $70,000 in delinquent debt and \nfailed to arrange payment or satisfaction of the majority of those debts over a period of \nyears. He offered no information that his financial delinquencies resulted from \ncircumstances beyond his control. Applicant\u2019s unwillingness to address his financial \ndelinquencies suggests that they will continue and likely recur.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.y.: Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.z.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.aa. and 1.ab.: Against Applicant \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Applicant is 53 and separated. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment. Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is financially overextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant denied all of the allegations under this guideline. The Applicant and his wife were married for 20 years at the time of their separation in July 2001. A formal separation agreement has not been entered into between the parties since that date. (Transcript at 68-81.) The Applicant filed for divorce in June 2006 and no decree of divorce had been entered into as of the date of the hearing. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.) When the Applicant and his wife separated, they took out a second mortgage, which allowed them to pay off all the debts that were owing at that time. Since 2001, the Applicant\u2019s wife has run up debts that were joint debts because the Applicant\u2019s name was still on the account, even though he had no knowledge of the debt.

On April 9, 2008, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed Answers to the SOR on May 1 and May 22, 2008, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on June 4, 2008.  I received the case assignment on June 4, 2008.  DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on June 11, 2008, setting the hearing for June 27, 2008. The\nApplicant requested a continuance and, after showing good cause, it was granted.  An\n\n2\namended notice of hearing was issued on June 27, 2008.  The hearing was convened\non July 10, 2008.  \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called two additional witnesses,\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H, without objection. The Applicant\nrequested that the record remain open for the submission of additional documents.  The\nrecord was left open until July 31, 2008, for the receipt of additional matters.  The\nApplicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I in a timely fashion, and it was received without\nobjection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on July 22, 2008.  The record\nclosed on July 31, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 53 and separated.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his\nemployment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is financially\noverextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds.  The\nApplicant denied all of the allegations under this guideline.\nThe Applicant and his wife were married for 20 years at the time of their\nseparation in July 2001.  A formal separation agreement has not been entered into\nbetween the parties since that date.  (Transcript at 68-81.)  The Applicant filed for\ndivorce in June 2006 and no decree of divorce had been entered into as of the date of\nthe hearing.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)  When the Applicant and his wife separated, they\ntook out a second mortgage, which allowed them to pay off all the debts that were\nowing at that time.  Since 2001, the Applicant\u2019s wife has run up debts that were joint\ndebts because the Applicant\u2019s name was still on the account, even though he had no\nknowledge of the debt.  The Applicant did not discover the extent of his wife\u2019s conduct\nuntil 2006.  (Transcript at 50.)\nAbout a year after he separated from his wife, the Applicant moved in with his\ngirlfriend.  In 2003 one of her grandchildren was diagnosed with a serious and\npotentially fatal illness.  The Applicant financially assisted his girlfriend\u2019s family with\nexpenses during this time.  This situation exacerbated his own financial condition, as\nthese expenses forced him to make choices concerning what bills to pay.  (Transcript at\n50-51.)\nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $2,793.00\nfor a credit card.  The Applicant successfully paid this debt for a negotiated amount\n\n3\n($1,397.00) on February 27, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 6 at 2; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C;\nTranscript at 50.)  \nSubparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $14,000.00\nto a creditor.  This debt is related to a spa that was purchased to help his girlfriend\u2019s\ngrandson.  The Applicant has been making payments on this account since May 2004.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I at 2-30.)  As of the date of the hearing he had paid at least\n$9,303.00 on this account. The Applicant testified that he contacted this creditor by\ntelephone and they indicated he would be current on his payments once he made the\n$700.00 payment shown in Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I at 3.  (Transcript at 51-55.)\nSubparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant denies that he owes $9,700.00 on a credit card\ndebt.  He has consistently stated that this debt was run up by his wife after the date of\nthe separation, and is therefore her separate debt.  (Transcript at 55-59.)  In a letter to\nDOHA dated May 2, 2008, Applicant\u2019s attorney confirms this account.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit E at 1.)  The Applicant submitted a copy of the proposed stipulated judgment in\nhis divorce case, in which his wife takes responsibility for this debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nI at 37-38.)\nSubparagraph 1.d.  The Applicant denies that he owes $17,067.00 on a credit\ncard debt.  He has consistently stated that this debt was run up by his wife after the date\nof the separation, and is therefore her separate debt.  (Transcript at 55-59.)  In a letter\nto DOHA dated May 2, 2008, Applicant\u2019s attorney confirms this account.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit E at 1.)  The Applicant submitted a copy of the proposed stipulated judgment in\nhis divorce case, in which his wife takes responsibility for this debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nI at 37-38.)\nSubparagraph 1.e.  The Applicant testified, and the record confirms, that this\ndebt and the one set forth in Subparagraph 1.g., below, are the same.  (Transcript at\n59.)\nSubparagraph 1.f.  The Applicant denies that he owes $13,239.00 on a credit\ncard debt.  He has consistently stated that this debt was run up by his wife after the date\nof the separation, and is therefore her separate debt.  (Transcript at 62.)  In a letter to\nDOHA dated May 2, 2008, Applicant\u2019s attorney confirms this account.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit E at 2.)  The Applicant submitted a copy of the proposed stipulated judgment in\nhis divorce case, in which his wife takes responsibility for this debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nI at 37-38.)\nSubparagraph 1.g.  The Applicant admits that he owed $8,778.00 on a credit\ncard debt.  The Applicant has been making payments on this account since January\n2005, consistently since October 2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I at 2-30.)  As of the date of\nthe hearing he had paid at least $5,548.00 on this account.  On July 11, 2008, the\nApplicant paid this debt in full by making a $7,475.14 payment.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I at\n31.)\n\n4\nSubparagraph 1.h.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $570.00\nfor a credit card.  The Applicant successfully paid this debt for a negotiated amount\n($418.78) on April 21, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 6 at 2; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G;\nTranscript at 62.)  \nSubparagraph 1.i.  The Applicant denies that he owes $3,900.00 on a credit card\ndebt.  He has consistently stated that this debt was run up by his wife after the date of\nthe separation, and is therefore her separate debt.  (Transcript at 63.)  In a letter to\nDOHA dated May 2, 2008, Applicant\u2019s attorney confirms this account.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit E at 2.)  The Applicant submitted a copy of the proposed stipulated judgment in\nhis divorce case, in which his wife takes responsibility for this debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nI at 37-38.)\nAs of the date the record closed, the Applicant had paid approximately\n$24,141.78 towards the four debts in the SOR that he admits are his.  The Applicant\ntestified that he will pay all of his financial obligations.  (Transcript at 82-84.)  He\nunderstands that he still has a legal responsibility for those debts which he maintains\nare his wife\u2019s, even if they were incurred without his knowledge.  (Transcript at 76-78.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant has worked in the Defense industry for over 30 years.  The entire\ntime he has had a security clearance.  \nA co-worker, and the Applicant\u2019s girlfriend, both testified on the Applicant\u2019s\nbehalf.  The co-worker once was an employee the Applicant supervised, but who is now\na supervisor on his own account, has known the Applicant since 2001.  He describes\nthe Applicant as a person of \u201cintegrity,\u201d \u201cvery fair,\u201d and \u201ctrustworthy.\u201d  (Transcript at 30-\n37.)\nThe Applicant also submitted his evaluations for the past several years, as well\nas work related awards and commendations.  The documents show that he is a highly\nrespected and successful employee, consistently rated as an \u201cExceptional\u201d or \u201cHigh\u201d\ncontributor.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.) \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n5\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security concerns.\nThe Applicant admits that he owed the debts set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b.,\n1.g. and 1.h.  The other subparagraphs he denied either as a duplicate debt, or that\nthey were his wife\u2019s debts, incurred after their separation, and her responsibility.  The\nevidence is sufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying condition, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) states that it may be mitigating if \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. . . . unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.\u201d  Finally, \u00b6 20(e) applies where, \u201cthe individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debts which is the cause of\nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d\n The Applicant separated from his wife in 2001.  At that time his debt situation\nwas fine.  She subsequently incurred debts without his knowledge, but which are\ncurrently his legal responsibility.  They are in the midst of a protracted divorce and the\nApplicant and his counsel represent that they will make sure that these debts are paid\nas part of the divorce.  As described at length above, the Applicant has been paying his\nown indebtedness, albeit slowly, for years.  That was because of his girlfriend\u2019s\ngrandson\u2019s illness and the financial impacts of it.  I find the behavior occurred under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns\nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence raises this\npotentially mitigating condition.\n \n\n7\nAG \u00b620(c) applies if \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control.\u201d  Evidence that Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts@ is also mitigating under \u00b620(d).\nThe Applicant has been able to pay his current bills for several years, and has paid a\nsubstantial amount of money towards the arrearage.  Three of the four debts he admits\nto in the SOR have been completely paid off.  I conclude these potentially mitigating\nconditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b62(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b62(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant got into financial\ndifficulty because of his separation from his wife, and because of the health problems of\nhis girlfriend\u2019s family.  He has a plan to pay all of his debts and is fulfilling it.  He has\nbehaved reasonably and appropriately in trying to resolve his debts, thereby AG \u00b6\n2(a)(6) applies.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little\nto no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that the\nlikelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.  He is currently eligible for a\nsecurity clearance.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 46-year-old associate for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant married her first husband (H1) in September 1992 (see ex. 6). She and H1 filed for divorce in December 1996 (finalized in September 1998). Applicant and H continued to cohabit after they determined to file for divorce. They needed their joint income to cover their mortgage and continued to live in their home while they endeavored to sell it (see ex. 6). Their home was appraised at the time at $40,000.00 below the balance owed on their mortgage (about $101,000.00). Because their lender would not approve a short sale, they could not avert a default on their mortgage. Their mortgage, in turn, was foreclosed in April 1997. At public auction in July 1997, their property was sold for more than the loan value of the property (leaving no potential deficiency balance). After the foreclosure, Applicant and H1 moved into a townhouse to be closer to their respective jobs (ex. 6). Applicant vacated the townhouse in October 1997 (see ex. 6). Applicant\u2019s divorce decree with H1 provided for each spouse to take full responsibility for their respective car payments (see ex. 6). When H1's car was later repossessed, Applicant agreed to repay one-half of the deficiency balance (estimated to be $6,950.00) and satisfied her share of the debt. ",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 4, 2008, and elected to have her case\ndecided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on May 15, 2008.  Applicant did not submit any information in\nresponse to the FORM.  The case was assigned to me July 21, 2008.\nSeptember 25, 2008\n\n2\nProcedural Issues\nDepartment Counsel requests that official notice be taken of the Equifax Training\nBrochure (ex. 15) included in the FORM.  There being no objections from Applicant, and\ngood cause being shown, Department Counsel\u2019s request is granted.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) petitioned for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy relief in September 2006 (dismissed in December 2006), (b) petitioned for\nChapter 13 bankruptcy relief in November 2006 (dismissed in January 2007, \u00a9)\npetitioned for Chapter 13 relief in February 2007 (dismissed in April 2007), and (d)\nincurred five delinquent debts exceeding $120,000.00. These allegations are framed by\nsubparagraphs 1.b through1.I (subparagraph 1.a is missing).  For her answer to the\nSOR, Applicant denied each of the allegations without explanation.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old associate for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married her first husband (H1) in September 1992 (see ex. 6). She and\nH1 filed for divorce in December 1996 (finalized in September 1998).  Applicant and H\ncontinued to cohabit after they determined to file for divorce.  They needed their joint\nincome to cover their mortgage and continued to live in their home while they\nendeavored to sell it (see ex. 6).  Their home was appraised at the time at $40,000.00\nbelow the balance owed on their mortgage (about $101,000.00).  Because their lender\nwould not approve a short sale, they could not avert a default on their mortgage.  Their\nmortgage, in turn, was foreclosed in April 1997.  At public auction in July 1997, their\nproperty was sold for more than the loan value of the property (leaving no potential\ndeficiency balance).  After the foreclosure, Applicant and H1 moved into a townhouse to\nbe closer to their respective jobs (ex. 6).  Applicant vacated the townhouse in October\n1997 (see ex. 6).\n Applicant\u2019s divorce decree with H1 provided for each spouse to take full\nresponsibility for their respective car payments (see ex. 6). When H1's car was later\nrepossessed, Applicant agreed to repay one-half of the deficiency balance (estimated to\nbe $6,950.00) and satisfied her share of the debt. H1 never paid his share of the\nremaining debt, according to Applicant,  and the lender, in turn, looked to Applicant for\nthe deficiency (see ex. 6).\nApplicant remarried in February 2004 (ex. 4).  In October 2007.  Applicant and\nher husband (H2) have no children from this marriage. \n\n3\nExperiencing unemployment and associated income shortages, Appellant\npetitioned for Chapter 13 relief on four separate occasions between April 2006 and\nFebruary 2007 (see exs. 11 and 13).  Before filing her first petition, Applicant sought\nand obtained financial counseling (see ex. 8).  Appellant\u2019s bankruptcy schedules report\n$27,835.00 in personal property and $340,397.00 in real property.  Reported liabilities\ninclude $37,653.00 in secured claims and $5,952.00 in unsecured claims (see ex. 7).\nEach of her Chapter 13 petitions was dismissed.  \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports lists each of the dismissed Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nfilings and delinquent debts covered in the SOR (see exs. 11, 12 and 13).  Her credit\nreports include a fourth Chapter 13 petition (filed in April 2006 and dismissed in August\n2006) that was not listed in the SOR. \nApplicant provided no documentation in her behalf to support any further\nprogress in the resolution of her debts.  She provided no endorsements or performance\nevaluations.  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.  Adjudication Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18.\n\n4\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nFollowing their divorce in 1996, Applicant and her husband encountered financial\nsetbacks that resulted in the foreclosure of their home, repossession of her husband\u2019s\nvehicle, defaults in their other debts, and a series of unsuccessful Chapter 13 petitions\n(four in all between April 2006 and February 2007).  Applicant has not provided any\ndocumentation of her repayment efforts. Absent documented discharge or payment\ninitiatives with her listed creditors,  these debts raise security significant concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual appellant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\ndelinquent debts and her inability to successfully address them warrants the application\nof two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial considerations:\nDC  \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not\n\n5\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d  These disqualifying conditions cover the core concern of\nAG \u00b6 18: poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, which, both individually and collectively, can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to safely occupy a position of trust.  \nApplicant\u2019s accumulated debts are attributable in part to set backs associated with\nher divorce, foreclosure of her home, unemployment and other considerations not\nexplained.  Based on her very limited accounts of her financial set backs, partial\napplication of MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is warranted here.  \nAt this time, none of Applicant\u2019s covered debts are documented to have been\npaid, disputed, or settled.  They exceed $120,000.00 in the aggregate and represent a\nconsiderable debt load based on her current income sources.  While her financial\ncounseling and unsuccessful Chapter 13 efforts represent some positive steps to resolve\nher financial difficulties, she provides no evidence of any follow-through in addressing\nher outstanding debts.  Her dismissed petitions and still unsatisfied debts preclude the\nassignment of any significant mitigation weight to her efforts to date. \nWithout more documented information to demonstrate Applicant is addressing her\nsignificant debt accumulation, she cannot mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial responsibilities,\nwhich include the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial stability in a\nperson cleared for access to classified information is required precisely to inspire trust\nand confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of a clearance\nholder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and influence,\njudgment and trust concerns are important concerns as well.\nUse of a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt repayment efforts is insufficient to enable\nher to surmount security concerns independent of the express disqualifying conditions\ncovered by AG \u00b6 18.  Without more exhibited repayment and work-out efforts to\ndemonstrate progress in resolving her debts, it is difficult to draw convincing conclusions\nabout her overall trustworthiness based on factors not covered in the mitigation\nconditions of the guideline for financial considerations. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance of\na \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d in the management of an applicant\u2019s finances, which\ncertainly includes evidence of actual debt reduction through repayments. See ISCR\nCase No. 05-01920, at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007).  True, an applicant\u2019s good-faith debt\nrepayment does not require that she demonstrate repayment of each and every listed\ndebt.  All that is required is that the applicant demonstrate that she developed a plan to\nresolve her debts and taken significant actions to implement the plan.  See ISCR Case\n\n6\nNo. 07-16013, at 2 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-09684, at 2 (App. Bd.\nJuly 6, 2006). \nApplicant fails to meet  Appeal Board requirements for repayment progress with\nher listed creditors.  Absent some tangible form of payments and/or repayment plans on\nher listed debts, safe predictive judgments about her finances cannot be made at this\ntime.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\nunsatisfied debts and overall presentation of payment histories, Applicant does not\nmitigate security concerns related to her still outstanding debts.  Unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.b through1.i.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT   \nSub-paras. 1.b through 1.I:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

On June 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security \nconcerns for alcohol consumption, financial considerations, personal conduct, and \ncriminal conduct under Guidelines G, F, E, and J, respectively. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on \nAugust 5, 2008. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 25, 2008.  Applicant admitted \nthe three factual allegations under Guideline G but denied that there was a security \nconcern.  He denied three and admitted two factual allegations under Guideline E, and \ndenied there was a security concern under this guideline.  The criminal conduct factual \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nallegations under Guideline J arose both from the actions associated with the alcohol \nconsumption offenses as well as the personal conduct allegations for a false or \ninaccurate security clearance application.  Applicant admitted the factual allegations as \nnoted for his responses to Guidelines G and E, but denied there was a security concern \nunder Guideline J.  He admitted the four factual allegations under Guideline F, but \ndenied there was a security concern.  He requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge.   \n \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 28, 2008, and the case \nwas assigned to me on October 16, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October \n21, 2008, for a hearing on November 5, 2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \nThe government offered 13 exhibits, marked government exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through \n13, which were received without objection.  Applicant and one Applicant witness \ntestified on his behalf.  The record was left open until November 19, 2008, for Applicant \nto submit supporting documents.  Applicant timely submitted four documents, marked \nas Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through D.  These documents were admitted into the \nrecord without objection (Gov. Ex 14).  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non November 12, 2008.  Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and has been a material control planner for a defense \ncontractor for almost three years.  His supervisor hired Applicant for his position in \n2006.  He stated Applicant is conscientious and dependable and has great potential for \nadvancement. He is a significant contributor to his company's mission.  Everyone \nApplicant deals with is complimentary of his performance and the support he provides \nthem (App. Ex. D, Letter, dated November 19, 2008).  Applicant is married with two \nchildren.  He has attended college and is a few credits short of receiving his degree \n(Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated June 7, 2007). \n \nApplicant admits he was arrested for driving while intoxicated and while on a \nrevoked /suspended driver's license in November 2000.  He had left a graduation party \nat a relative's house before he was stopped by police.   \n \nApplicant was convicted of driving while intoxicated in February 2001, sentenced \nto a suspended jail term, his license was suspended for 12 months, and he was \nrequired to attend an Alcohol Safety Awareness program.  He failed to complete the \nprogram and was ordered on July 3, 2001 to show cause why he failed to comply with \nthe program (Gov. Ex. 3, Case Information, dated June 4, 2008; Gov. Ex. 4, Case \nInformation, dated November 15, 2000; Gov. Ex. 13, Interrogatories, dated August 17, \n2007 at 2).   \n \nApplicant admitted that he was again arrested for driving while intoxicated \n(second offense) and driving with a revoked/suspended driver's license in May 2001.  \nHe was sentenced to a jail term which was suspended except for ten days, his license \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwas suspended for 36 months, and he was again required to attend the Alcohol Safety \nAwareness Program.  The show cause order of July 3, 2001 also covered his failure to \nattend this course as ordered (Gov. Ex. 5, Case Information, dated May 24, 2001).  \n \n Applicant admitted he was arrested and convicted in July 2006 for driving while \nintoxicated (third offense) and driving after forfeiture of his license (Gov. Ex. 7, Case \nInformation, dated July 21. 2006).  A friend called Applicant and told him he was moving \nfrom the area and wanted to have a last drink with him.  Applicant drove to meet the \nfriend and had two beers.  He was arrested on his way home for driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol.  His wife had to post his bail and pick up their car.  Applicant did \nnot have a license at the time.  Applicant stated he was tired and is not much of an \nalcohol drinker which was the reason he was determined by the police to be intoxicated.  \nApplicant admitted he made a conscious decision to drive even though his license had \nbeen revoked (Tr. 28-29, 44-46; Gov. Ex. 13, Interrogatories, dated August 17, 2007 \nat1-2).   \n \nApplicant denied that his three convictions for driving while intoxicated were a \nsecurity concern based on alcohol consumption.  Applicant's attorney from the 2006 \noffense told him that his convictions were for traffic offenses and were not criminal.  \nHowever, since Applicant received jail sentences he feels the offense were criminal.  \nApplicant did attend some Alcoholic Anonymous meetings before and after his 2006 \nconviction.  He stopped attending meetings some time in 2007.  He did see a counselor \nconcerning alcohol abuse after his earlier convictions.  He has not seen a counselor \nsince the 2006 incident.  His last drink of alcohol was the night of the 2006 incident.  He \ndoes not consider himself an alcohol abuser (Tr. 30-31, 35-38).  Applicant did not \ninitially complete the required Alcohol Safety Awareness Program.  He missed a class \nand was ordered back to court.  He eventually completed the course (Tr. 42-43). \n \nApplicant admitted that he was arrested and convicted for speeding and driving \non a suspended driver's license in April 2002.  He was sentenced to a 90-day jail term, \nof which 80 days was suspended (Gov. Ex. 6, Case Information, dated April 29, 2002).  \nHe admitted he was arrested and convicted for speeding and driving on a \nrevoked/suspended driver's license in March 2005 and sentenced to 180 days, in jail of \nwhich 160 days was suspended and paid a $200 fine (Gov. Ex. 9, Case Information, \ndated March 31, 2005).   \n \nApplicant denied he was charged with disorderly conduct in August 2003 (Gov. \nEx. 8, Case Information, dated August 11, 2003).  Applicant stated that he was exiting a \nrestaurant with friends when a police officer, who was a distance from the restaurant, \ntold the group they were being loud, boisterous, and disorderly.  Applicant was charged \nwith disorderly conduct.  At his court hearing, Applicant and the police officer testified.  \nApplicant informed the judge he was leaving the restaurant with friends and they were \nhaving a conversation.  The judge entered a finding of not guilty.  He did not believe he \nneeded to note the offense on the security clearance application since he was found not \nguilty (Tr. 31-32).   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant denied falsifying his security clearance application by failing to disclose \nall of the driving while intoxicated offenses and the traffic offenses in response to \nquestions concerning his police record.  Applicant listed his 2000 and 2006 driving while \nintoxicated offense in response to questions on his security clearance applicant.  He \nfailed to list his 2003 driving while intoxicated offense or his other driving offenses of \nspeeding and driving on a suspended or revoked license.  Applicant stated it was an \noversight on his part to not include the information in response to the question.  He \ncompleted the form a number of times but it kept getting lost in the system and he had \nto redo the form.  This process may have accounted for his failure to list the offenses.  \nHe knew the government would be able to examine his record and learn about the \noffenses so there was no reason not to list them.  His failure to list the offenses was not \nintentional.  It did not surprise him that he failed to list the offense because he tends to \nforget bad things that happened to him. (Tr. 32-34).  He did list his alcohol counseling \nas a result of the driving while intoxicated incidents.  He denied that his failure to \ncompletely list all of his offenses amounted to a security concern for personal conduct.   \n \nApplicant admitted that as a result of an automobile accident judgments were \nplaced against him for $10,317 by the insurance company of the other vehicle involved \nin the accident (Gov. Ex. 12, Judgment, dated march 31, 2004), and for $5,642 from the \nrental car agency for the car he was driving (Gov. Ex. 11, Judgment, dated June 4, \n2002).  Applicant has not paid the judgments.  He has spoken to representative of both \ncreditors stating his intent to pay the judgments.  However, he has not been able to \nmake any payments on the debts (Tr. 39-40, 46-49).  \n \nApplicant also admitted that he was indebted to one bank on two different credit \ncards for $4,330, and $3,334 (Tr. 49-50; Gov. Ex. 10, Credit Report, dated June 27, \n2007).  Applicant's wife now handles the family finances (Tr. 40-41, 49-50).  She \ntestified that she and Applicant have been married for over two years and have two \nyoung children.  She has known Applicant since they were college students.  She \nherself has had a security clearance for over 13 years with access to sensitive \ncompartmented information.  She understands the need for financial responsibility for \nsecurity clearance purposes.  The family has three credit cards with the same bank with \na total balance of approximately $7,025.  The couple has a total of six credit cards with \na combined balance of approximately $14,000.  Most of the credit card debt was \naccumulated by Appellant before they were married.  She believes he accumulated the \ndebts because he received the cards as a college student and used them to purchase \nitems.  She and her husband have a budget and part of the budget is to pay on the \ncards to keep them current (App. Ex. C, Budget, undated).  They are current with \npayments on all credit cards (Tr. 55-61; App. Ex. A, Statement, dated November 6, \n2008; App. Ex B. Letter, dated October 28, 2008).  Applicant denied that these debts \ncaused a security concern for financial considerations (See answer to SOR, dated July \n23, 2008). \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption is a security concern because it often leads to \nthe exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21)  Appellant\u2019s \nthree arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol raise Alcohol Consumption \nDisqualifying Conditions (AC DC) \u00b6 22(a) \"alcohol-related incidents away from work, \nsuch as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed \nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\"   \n \n \nI considered Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC) \u00b6 23(a) \"so \nmuch time has passed or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\" and determine that it \ndoes not apply.  There were three arrests in a six year period so his incidents of alcohol-\nrelated driving are frequent.  The last incident was only two yeas ago so it is recent.  \nThere were no unusual circumstances causing the offense.  Applicant willing drank \nalcohol and drove his car afterward.   \n \n \nI also considered AC MC \u00b6 23(b) \"the individual acknowledges his or her \nalcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of action taken to overcome \nthis problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser)\", and determined that it does not apply.  Applicant \nstated he no longer drinks alcohol.  He attended alcohol-related counseling for awhile \nbut ceased attending over a year ago.  He has not actively participated in counsel since \ncompletion of court order counseling in 2004.  His only positive sign has been his \nmarriage and the birth of his children.   \n \n \nI also considered AC MC \u00b6 23(c) \"the individual is a current employee who is  \nparticipating in  a counseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment \nand relapse, and is making satisfactory progress\"; and AC MC \u00b6 23(d) \"the individual \nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along \nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program\".  \nAppellant has had some counseling and attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous.  He has \nnot attended these counseling sessions since shortly after the 2006 alcohol-related \nincident.  Appellant has not presented information to meet his burden that his past \nalcohol use does not reflect now on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \nAppellant has not mitigated security concerns for alcohol consumption. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s incomplete answers to a \nquestion on his security clearance application concerning his police record raises a \nsecurity concern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) \n\"the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, to determine security eligibility or trustworthiness\". \n \n \nAppellant denied intentional falsification.  In response to questions on the \nsecurity clearance application, Applicant listed two of his three alcohol-related driving \nincidents and the alcohol counseling he attended as a result of these offenses.  He \nfailed to list one of the driving while intoxicated offense and some other traffic offenses.  \nApplicant testified that he completed his security clearance application a number of \ntimes and it was an oversight on his part not to list all of the offenses.  A security \nconcern may arise for an omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any \nwritten document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security \nclearance.  But every omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement is not a \nfalsification.  A falsification must be deliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done \nknowingly and willfully.  Since Applicant listed the two driving while intoxicated offenses \nand his alcohol counseling, the available information shows his failure to list all of the \noffenses was not knowing and willful.  Applicant established he did not deliberately fail \nto provide full information on the security clearance application with intent to deceive.  I \nfind for Appellant as to Personal Conduct pertaining to falsification of the security \nclearance application.  Since there is no intention to deceive, there is no violation of \nfederal law and no criminal conduct.  I also find for Applicant as to the part of the \ncriminal conduct security concern based on falsification of the security clearance \napplication. \n \n \nIn addition, Applicant\u2019s two driving on a revoked/suspended driver's license and \nspeeding offenses are a pattern of misconduct raising security concerns under PC DC \n16(c) \"credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, \nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protect information\"; PC DC 16(d) \"credible adverse information that \nis not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for \nan adverse determination, but which when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulation or other \ncharacteristics indicting the person may not properly safeguard protected information; \nand PC DC \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing, . .\"  Since he was found not guilty of the disorderly conduct \ncharges, I have not considered that offense as a part of the pattern of misconduct.  \n \n \nIn regard to this issue, I considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC \nMC) \u00b6 17(c) \"the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\", PC MC \u00b6 19(d) \"the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\"; and PC MC \u00b6 17(e) \"the \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation or duress\".  Applicant has a pattern of driving an automobile while his \nlicense is revoked or suspended.  His driving decisions were irresponsible indicating he \nwould act irresponsibly towards protecting classified information.  Driving while your \ndriver's license is revoked or suspended is not minor, particularly when it happens more \nthan once and driving while intoxicated is involved.   \n \n \nApplicant states that since he is now married and the father of two children, he \nhas taken positive steps to change his behavior.  However, he was married in 2006 \nwhen the latest instance of his driving without a license happened.  He has not \npresented any information to show any course of conduct that changes this behavior.  \nHis wife credibly testified that she has known him for over 13 years and she has seen a \nchange in his attitude since their marriage over two years ago.  While this is positive \ninformation, he last driving without a license offense happened after they were married \nand she had to bail him out and retrieve their car.  His actions were not caused by \nmarital issues but by his own irresponsible conduct.  I find against Applicant as to \nPersonal Conduct.   \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 30)  Appellant\u2019s convictions for driving \nwhile intoxicated and two driving on a suspended/revoked driver's license raises \nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) \"a single serious crime or \n\n \n9 \n \n \nmultiple lesser offenses\", and CD DC \u00b6 31(c) \"allegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted\". \n \nAppellant has raised by his testimony Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions \n(CC MC) \u00b6 32(a) \"so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\"; and CC MC \n\u00b6 32(d) \"there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement\".  There was at least one criminal offense a year from 2000 to 2006.  The \nlast offense was the driving while intoxicated offense in July 2006.  All of the offenses \nhappened because Applicant made a decision to drive after drinking alcohol or to drive \nknowing that his license was revoked or suspended.  The offenses did not happen \nunder unusual or unique circumstances.  Similar criminal incidents are likely to recur \nbecause his driver's license is still suspended and he could decide to drink and drive or \njust drive without having a license.  Applicant stated he has matured and no longer \ndrinks alcohol.  However, he is not involved in any counseling or alcohol prevention \nprogram.  Applicant has not presented sufficient information to mitigate security \nconcerns for criminal conduct.   \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Applicant admitted, and credit reports confirm, that he has delinquent debts \nfor two unpaid judgments from an automobile accident and two delinquent credit card \ndebts to a bank.  These delinquent debts and unpaid judgments are a security concern \nraising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) \"inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\", and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) \"a history of not meeting financial \nobligations\".   \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) \"the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\" applies.  The judgments were \nentered against Applicant in 2002 and 2004, and he has not made any payments.  \nApplicant talked to the creditors for the damage from the automobile accident but he \nhas not followed through on his promises to pay.  The judgments are still outstanding \nand current debts, and cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  While the credit cards are being paid and are current because of the \nfinancial management of Applicant's wife, the debts did not happen long and are only \ncurrent because of his wife's actions.  The credit card debt can likely recur even though \nthey are now current because of is wife's action in handling the family finances. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\" does not apply.  The judgments arose from \nan automobile accident.  Applicant is liable for the damage to the rental car he was \ndriving and for the damage to the other vehicle.  The accident was not beyond his \ncontrol.  Applicant presented no reasons for his failure to pay the debts except he does \nnot have the funds to do so.  This is not a reason beyond his control.  He has not acted \nreasonably under the circumstances.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\" applies to the credit cards only and not to \nthe judgments.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the \ndebts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a good-faith effort to repay.  A \nsystematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  Applicant and his wife have \nthe ability to pay the credit cad debts, have shown a strong desire to pay them, and \nhave shown a good effort to pay them.  Applicant's wife has established their budget \nand payments on the credit cards to keep them current.  However, no plan was \npresented to show how or when the judgments would be paid.  Applicant has not acted \nresponsibly towards the judgments and has not established his good-faith efforts to \nresolve the judgments.  He has not presented sufficient information to mitigated security \nconcerns for his financial situation. \n \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n11 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that Applicant is a \ngood employee and a conscientious and dependable worker held in high regard by this \nsupervisors and peers.  I considered Applicant has been married for over two years and \nhas two young children.  His wife holds a security clearance and is well aware of the \nrequirements to continue to hold a clearance.  His wife and family are a positive \ninfluence in his life.  I considered that he did not deliberately provide incomplete \ninformation on his security clearance application.  I considered that Applicant stated he \nno longer drinks alcohol, but he has not presented any information concerning present \ncounseling for alcohol abuse or present attendance at any alcohol prevention programs.  \nHis last alcohol-related incident is recent, only two years ago after he had the positive \ninfluence of being married.  Sufficient time of no alcohol-related incidents has not \npassed since 2006 to mitigate alcohol consumption issues given that he has a series of \nalcohol-related incidents starting in 2000.  He has two judgments of long standing that \nhe has not taken any action to resolve or pay.  He has had at least one criminal conduct \noffense a year from 2000 to 2006.  His actions indicate poor self control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.  Overall, on balance the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations, personal \nconduct, alcohol consumption, and criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline J: \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On February 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 11, 2009.

Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd.

DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 24, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on May 28, 2009. The government offered 15 exhibits (GE) 1 through 15,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf. He submitted five exhibits (AE) A through E, which were received and\nadmitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on May 28, 2009. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 5, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.s of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a\nand 2.b of the SOR.  He also provided additional information to support his request for\n1\neligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 31 years old, works as technician for a Department of Defense\ncontractor. He began working for this contractor in August 2005. Applicant\u2019s supervisors\nand managers describe him as an excellent employee, who is dependable, reliable and\nhonest.

He did not work for three or four\nmonths. His current employer offered him a job in July 2005. He moved, with his family,\nto the east coast at a significant cost, which he paid.5\nApplicant completed a financial statement on August 1, 2008. His personal\nfinancial statement showed a net monthly income of $5,226. With the loss of his wife\u2019s\nmonthly income and his travel pay, his current net monthly income is $3,200. He has\nincurred a net monthly income loss of $2,000. Applicant listed his monthly expenses at\n$3,850 on his personal financial statement. He no longer pays child care expenses, so\nhis net monthly expenses now total about $3,550. He acknowledged that he does not\nhave enough money each month to pay his expenses. Applicant will complete his truck\npayments by the end of 2009. He anticipates applying that $500 a month to debt\npayment.  \n6\nThe SOR lists numerous debts, which are listed at least once on each credit\nreport and sometimes more than once because the debt is under other creditor\u2019s\nnames. After reviewing the credit reports dated July 12, 2007, July 29, 2008, August 8,\n2008, January 17, 2009, February 25, 2009,  and the SOR, I have compiled a list of the\ntotal debts owed, excluding any duplicate entries.

His stepmother helped him\ndevelop a budget and suggested that he pay some of his smaller debts, which he has\ndone.  He does not want to file for bankruptcy as a way to resolve his debts. He knows\n8\nhe needs to improve his credit by paying his debts. 9\nWhen he completed his e-QIP, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the following\nquestions:\nSection 28. Your Financial Delinquencies\na. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\n\nId. at 14, 36-37, 69, 76-77, 79, 80-83.\n10\nId.; GE 5 (Interview summary); GE 10 (SF-86, dated April 2000) at 10; GE 13 (SF-86, dated December 2001)\n11\nat 9.\n5\nb. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\nApplicant acknowledges that he knew he was 90 days past due on his truck\npayments and had two other unpaid debts at the time he completed his security\nclearance application. He did not know about most of his debts as he was not receiving\nany letters from creditors. He admitted that he did not start his e-QIP until near the end\nof  the 30 days in which he had to complete it. Because he had little time to complete\nhis e-QIP, he could not obtain his credit report and complete all the information on his\ndebts. He states that after calling his security officer and explaining his problem, the\nsecurity officer told him to answer \u201cno\u201d to these questions and advised that he could\nprovide information to the investigator. The employer\u2019s assistant facility security officer\ndenied providing this instruction to Applicant, but had no recall of a telephone call from\nApplicant on this issue.  \n10\nApplicant met with the investigator. He states that he gave his credit report to the\ninvestigator. The investigator\u2019s report indicates that the investigator reviewed\nApplicant\u2019s debts with him during the interview. The report does not reflect the source of\nthe information about Applicant\u2019s debts or who provided the information. However, the\ninvestigator noted that Applicant planned to request his credit report to address certain\ndebts about which Applicant was unclear. When he completed his SF-86 in 2001,\nApplicant identified existing financial problems, but did not in his SF-86 completed 18\nmonths earlier in 2000.11\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n6\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not raised in this case.\n12\n7\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts and has been unable to pay\nmany of these debts for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant has a\nlong history of accumulating debts, many of which remain unpaid. His debts are old and\nrecent, and did not occur under unusual circumstances. This mitigating condition does\nnot apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\u2019s wife lost her\njob in January 2009 and remains unemployed. He no longer travels for his employer.\nThe loss of her income and his travel pay has reduced their net monthly income.\nApplicant currently pays his monthly bills, but without his wife\u2019s income he cannot pay\nhis old debts. He acts responsibly by paying his monthly expenses and by making an\neffort to keep these expenses current. This mitigating condition has partial applicability\nin this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant met with a financial counselor once. With the help of\nhis stepmother, he developed a budget and paid some of his small debts. His current\nexpenses are under control, but he has not resolved many of the debts listed in the\nSOR. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions have some applicability.12\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n13\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\nUnder AG \u00b6 16, the following conditions could raise a security concern in this\ncase and may be disqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted a material fact from his SF-86 when he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to the questions about debts currently delinquent over 90 days and debts\ndelinquent over 180 days in the last seven years. This information is material to the\nevaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his honesty.\nIn his response and at the hearing, Applicant strongly denies, however, that he had an\nintent to hide information about his finances. When a falsification allegation is\ncontroverted, the government has the burden of proving the omission was deliberate.\nProof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the\nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred.  For DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s\n13\nomission, concealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate.\nApplicant denied intentionally leaving out information about his past due debts\nand current financial problems. At the time he completed his e-QIP, Applicant had\nknowledge of some past due debts and he has so admitted. Because Applicant knew he\nowed debts, the government has established that Applicant intentionally hid his debt\nproblems. The disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a)  applies.\nI have reviewed the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and find that none are\napplicable in this case. He has not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under\nGuideline E. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n9\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nserved honorably in the Army and is highly respected by his supervisors for his work.\nHe is an excellent and reliable employee. He paid a few small debts. However, since his\nwife lost her job in January 2009, household income has declined significantly. While\nroutine monthly bills are paid, Applicant has no resources to repay his past debts until\nhe completes his payments on his truck or his wife returns to work. The issue is not\nsimply whether all his debts are paidBit is whether his financial circumstances raise\nconcerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. At this time, the amount of his\nunpaid debts raises security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) In addition, his failure to be\nforthright about his finances when completing his e-QIP, raises a security concern.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On December 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 29, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February \n6, 2009. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on February 10, 2009. \nThe case was delayed because Applicant works at a remote location and was not \navailable until July 2009. The case was transferred to me on June 1, 2009. On June 18, \n2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for July 13, 2009. The \ncase was heard on that date. The Government offered three exhibits which were \nAugust 12, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadmitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 3 without objection. Applicant and his wife \ntestified and offered seven exhibits which were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - G. \nThe record was held open until July 27, 2009 to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments.  Applicant timely submitted a two-page document that was admitted as AE \nH. Department Counsel\u2019s comments pertaining to the document are marked as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I. The transcript was received on July 30, 2009. Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations. \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance. He has been employed with the defense contractor since \nOctober 2004.  Prior to this position, he served on active duty in the United States Air \nForce, retiring as a Master Sergeant after 22 years of honorable service. He has held a \nSECRET clearance for 26 years. He is married and has two sons, ages 20 and 23. (Tr \nat 4-5, 8, 27; Gov 1) \n   \nOn July 12, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). (Gov 1) A subsequent background investigation \nconfirmed that Applicant had the following delinquent accounts:  a $7,607 credit card \naccount placed for collection in May 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 2, 6, 19; Gov 3 at 2); a \n$4,757 credit card account that was placed for collection in April 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov \n2 at 2, 19; Gov 3 at 2); a $19,490 second mortgage foreclosure that was charged off in \nApril 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 2 at 2, 10-18, 20); and a $7,891 credit card \naccount that was placed for collection in May 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 2, 7, 20; Gov 3 \nat 2).  \n \nApplicant works at an isolated location in the northern hemisphere. He works for \nten weeks and then is off for five weeks. (Tr at 5) His wife handles the household \nfinances.  In 1994, Applicant and his wife purchased a home while he was still on active \nduty. They lived in the house until September 2006, when they moved into a new home \nthey had built. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that all of her friends were building new homes \nand had no problems selling their homes prior to moving into the new homes. She \ncontacted Applicant in early 2006 to ask if they could build a new home. Applicant told \nher that he had no problem with building a new home as long as they sold their current  \nhome. The home they were building would not be ready for six months so Applicant\u2019s \nwife thought that they would have no trouble selling their old home. (Tr at 22-25; Gov 2 \nat 2) \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant and his wife moved into their new home. Their old \nhome did not sell. They became responsible for two mortgages. They attempted to rent \nout their old home but were unable to find renters. They paid both mortgages for a \nperiod of six months, occasionally charging the mortgage payments on their credit \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncards. In March 2007, they could no longer afford to make the mortgage payments. In \nFebruary 2008, their old home was foreclosed. The home had two mortgages. (Tr at 25, \n32-34, 46; Gov 2 at 5) \n  \nAround late December 2006, Applicant\u2019s oldest son was arrested. He was \nincarcerated and his bond was initially set at $100,000. It was subsequently reduced to \n$75,000, but they had to pay ten percent of the bond to get him out of jail. He was \narrested again in June 2007. His bond was set at $10,000 and Applicant had to pay \n$1,000 to get him out of jail. His son went into a rehabilitation facility. He was \ninvoluntarily released from the rehabilitation facility and got into further trouble, and is \ncurrently in jail. Applicant and his wife have spent about $12,000 in bail money for their \nson\u2019s arrests. (Tr at 25-27) Their youngest son attends college. They provide him \nmoney for expenses such as books. (Tr at 27) \n \nApplicant and his wife were unable to keep up with their finances as a result of \nbeing responsible for two mortgages and the expenses paid related to their son\u2019s \nrepeated criminal problems. Applicant\u2019s wife does not work. (Tr at 34, 46; Gov 2 at 5) \n \nApplicant has been working on resolving his delinquent debts for at least a year. \nIn December 2008, he consulted with a judge advocate about how to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. The status of the delinquent debts are: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, $7,607 delinquent credit card account placed for collection: In \nJanuary 2009, Applicant agreed to pay the collection agency $100 a month. Timely \npayments have been made in accordance with the agreement. (Tr at 16, 21-22, 32; AE \nA; AE H) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, $4,757 credit card account placed for collection: In September 2008, \nApplicant originally agreed to pay $100 a month towards this account. The account was \nsold to another collection agency. Applicant agreed to pay $150.96 per month for 36 \nmonths towards this account. Timely payments have been made in accordance with the \nagreement.

However, the \npersonal financial statement did not include his debt payments towards SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, and 1.d. The total amount paid towards these three debts each month is $495, \nleaving an excess of $508 each month. (Tr at 37; Gov 2 at 4)  \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and FC DC \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  \nApplicant recently accumulated four delinquent accounts, an approximate total balance \nof $39,745.   \n \nThe government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following Financial Considerations \nMitigating Conditions (FC MC) potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. While Applicant \nhas been making payments towards each of his delinquent accounts, only one account \nwas resolved at the close of the record. The debts became delinquent over the past few \nyears, so they are recent. FC MC \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were \nthe result of a downturn in the real estate market. He and his wife were unable to sell \ntheir older home which made them responsible for two mortgages after their new home \nwas built. However, Applicant\u2019s decision to buy a new home was within his control. His \noldest son\u2019s repeated criminal arrests created additional expenses for the family.    \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant and his wife were \nunable to pay both mortgages. They attempted to rent out their older home but were \nunsuccessful. Their largest debt, the $19,000 second mortgage, was cancelled by the \nbank. Over the past year, Applicant has been actively attempting to resolve his \nremaining delinquent accounts. He did so while living thousands of miles away from his \nfamily. Overall, FC MC \u00b6 20 (b) applies.     \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) applies. In December 2008, Applicant consulted with a judge advocate as to \nhow to resolve his delinquent accounts. He entered into repayment plans for each of his \nremaining delinquent accounts. He is capable of meeting the terms of these repayment \nagreements and his expenses.  He is working to resolve these accounts. \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. Applicant\u2019s largest debt, the $19,000 \nsecond mortgage has been cancelled. He entered into repayment agreements with the \nother debts, and has been making timely payments towards these accounts for more \nthan six months. He and his wife have proactively monitored their credit report. They \nvolunteered during the hearing that they discovered one more delinquent account. They \nentered into a repayment agreement with that account. Applicant is making a good-faith \neffort to resolve his accounts.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s 22 years of \nactive duty service in the United States Air Force. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were a \nresult of being responsible for two mortgages because he and his wife were not able to \nsell their older home. His oldest son\u2019s criminal problems placed an additional financial \nburden on the family finances during the same period of time that they were having \nproblems with paying the mortgage. Applicant has focused on resolving his delinquent \naccounts for the past year. The bank cancelled the largest debt related to the second \nmortgage. Applicant entered into payment agreements and is making payments towards \nhis remaining delinquent accounts. Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised \nunder financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 24, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline G\n\n2\n(Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On August 29, 2008, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge Joseph Testan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence, and whether the Judge erred in his evaluation\nof the Guideline G mitigating conditions.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant began consuming alcohol\nin college in the 1990s, drinking once or twice a week and becoming intoxicated once or twice a\nmonth.  Following college, his alcohol consumption increased.  By July 2006 he was consuming six\nalcoholic beverages a day.  This continued until March 20, 2007, when he drank to the point of semi-\nconsciousness.  He consulted a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with \u201calcoholism\u201d and prescribed\na drug.  Applicant no longer takes the drug, as he states he has stopped craving alcohol.  In 2003,\nApplicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.  He was fined $375.00 and his\nlicense was suspended for six months.  Applicant attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings regularly.\nIn the Analysis portion of his decision, the Judge stated that he had considered the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the entire record.  He noted that, following college\ngraduation, Applicant \u201cincreased the frequency of his excessive alcohol consumption to the point\nthat by July 2006, he was consuming six alcoholic beverages on a daily basis.  This daily abuse\noccurred long after his serious alcohol-related driving incident in 2003 . . . These facts, together with\nhis diagnosis of \u2018alcoholism,\u2019 suggest that [A]pplicant\u2019s alcohol problem is severe, and will require\na significant period of abstinence\u2013much longer than the approximately 15 months of abstinence he\nhas to date\u2013to safely conclude his abuse of alcohol . . . is unlikely to recur.\u201d  Decision at 5.  \nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole.  The Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings of security concern are supported by substantial record evidence.  See  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d)  Applicant\ncontends that the Judge did not assign sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence, such as\n\u201cchanges in behavior supportive of sobriety\u201d and his stated intention never to use alcohol again.\nHowever, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record unless he specifically\nstates otherwise.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  \u201cAn applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d  See  ISCR Case\nNo. 07-10454 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2008).  Furthermore, Applicant chose to have the case decided\nupon the written record, with the result that his credibility could not be evaluated in the context of\na hearing.  See ISCR Case No. 08-00899 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2008). \nThe Judge has drawn a rational connection between the facts found and his ultimate adverse\nsecurity clearance decision.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See also\n\n3\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The\nJudge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with national security to grant [A]pplicant eligibility\nfor a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.

In his SOR Response, applicant stated the following about\nthis drug use:\nDuring [April and May 2007] I attended some parties and was offered the\nuse of these particular substances. At the time, I was new to my 12 step\nrecovery program (AA) and did not understand the implications of trying\nother \u201cexperiments.\u201d I quickly realized through my own interpretations and\nmy support group that this is not an alternative to alcohol. That my\n\u201cexperimentation\u201d should be stopped immediately, and that is what I did. I\nno longer have relations with those who use illegal substances and do not\nattend parties where there is use.\nDuring an interview with an OPM investigator in November 2007, applicant stated\nhe attended AA meetings weekly. In a February 2008 response to interrogatories sent\nto him by DOHA, and in his response to the FORM, applicant stated he attends AA\ndaily. He further stated in his response to the FORM that he does not intend to consume\nalcohol or use illegal drugs in the future.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n\n3\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H:  Drug Involvement\nThe security concern for drug involvement is set forth in Paragraph 24 of the\nAG, and is as follows:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nParagraph 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 25.a., \u201cany drug abuse\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is applicable.\nParagraph 26 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. Under Paragraph 26.a., it may be mitigating if \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\n\nThe diagnosis of \u201calcoholism\u201d was reported by applicant. It is reasonable to assume that the psychiatrist\u2019s\n2\nactual diagnosis was alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.\n4\ngood judgment.\u201d Under Paragraph 26.b., it may be mitigating if there is \u201ca demonstrated\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\u201d such as \u201cdisassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts,\u201d and \u201can appropriate period of abstinence.\u201d Applicant used\nthese drugs shortly after he stopped drinking. He realized he made a big mistake,\nstopped all use, stopped attending parties where drugs are used, and stopped\nassociating with drug users. Given these facts, his one year of abstinence, and his\ncredibly stated intention not to use illegal drugs in the future, both mitigating conditions\nare applicable.\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in Paragraph 21 of the\nAG, and is as follows:\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise a security concern. Under\nParagraph 22.a., \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 22.c., \u201chabitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 22.d., \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional\n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s history of consuming alcohol to excess in\ngeneral, and his alcohol-related driving conviction in 2003 and March 20, 2007 drinking\nepisode in particular, require application of the first two disqualifying conditions. The fact\nhe was diagnosed with \u201calcoholism\u201d by a psychiatrist requires application of the last\ndisqualifying condition.2\nParagraph 23 of the AG sets out potentially mitigating conditions. I have carefully\nreviewed them and conclude the only one applicable is 23.b: \u201cthe individual\nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if\nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\n\n5\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant began abusing alcohol\nwhile in college when he was relatively young. Had it ended when he graduated in 1998,\nhis alcohol consumption would have no current security significance. But it didn\u2019t.\nApplicant not only continued to abuse alcohol, he actually increased the frequency of\nhis excessive alcohol consumption to the point that by July 2006, he was consuming six\nalcoholic beverages on a daily basis. This daily abuse occurred long after his serious\nalcohol-related driving incident in 2003, and lasted for many months. These facts,\ntogether with his diagnosis of \u201calcoholism,\u201d suggest that applicant\u2019s alcohol problem is\nsevere, and will require a significant period of abstinence - much longer than the\napproximately 15 months of abstinence he has to date - to safely conclude his abuse of\nalcohol, and the poor judgment associated with it, is unlikely to recur. Accordingly,\nGuideline G is found against him.\nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use certainly reflects poorly on his judgment. Fortunately,\nhe realized relatively quickly that he was making a big mistake by trying to trade one\naddiction for another. He has taken credible actions to ensure he will not repeat the\nconduct, and given his one year of abstinence, it appears his actions have worked.\nBecause I conclude he is unlikely to abuse illegal drugs in the future, Guideline H is\nfound for applicant.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  FOR APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on August 14, 2006. On April 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 16, 2008\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 24, 2008, and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR on April 25, \n2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 30, 2008, and I received \nthe case assignment on June 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 4, \n2008, scheduling the case for July 2, 2008. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant did not offer any exhibits, and testified on his own \nbehalf. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 14, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a Request for Administrative Notice (Exhibit (Ex.) \nI(A)), requesting that I take administrative notice of the summary of facts contained in \nEx. I(A) as well as those facts in Exs. I through X. Without objection from Applicant, I \ntook administrative notice of the documents offered by Department Counsel, which \npertain to Lebanon. (Tr. 18-20).  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to \nLebanon were derived from Exs. I(A), and I through X, are contained infra under the \nsubheading \u201cLebanon\u201d of this decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old junior accountant/analyst, who has been employed by \na defense contractor since June 2004. Tr. 26-27. He is a first time applicant for a \nsecurity clearance and is applying for a clearance as an employment requirement. Tr. \n86-88.  \n \nApplicant was born in February 1967 in Sierra Leone to Lebanese parents. As \nsuch, he derived his Lebanese citizenship from his parents. GE 1. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) Until \nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1986, he lived in Sierra Leone and Lebanon. In \nAugust 1986 at age 19, he immigrated to the U.S. to attend school and has continuously \n\n \n3\nlived in the U.S. since then. Tr. 29-36. From November 1987 to October 1991, Applicant \nwas married to his first wife, a U.S. citizen by birth. That marriage ended by divorce. In \nJanuary 1992, he married his second and current wife, also a U.S. citizen by birth. \nApplicant and his wife have three sons, ages ten, eight, and seven. GE 1. His wife is \nemployed as a pharmacist technician. Tr. 78-79. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in March 1997, and was issued his U.S. passport in May 1998.

GE 1, Tr. 25-26. \n \nIn addition to his wife and three sons, Applicant has three family members living \nin the U.S., his mother, two sisters, and a half brother. His mother was born in Lebanon \nin June 1948 and is 60 years old. His first sister was born in Sierra Leone in June 1968 \nand is 40 years old. She is a citizen of Lebanon. His second sister was born in Sierra \nLeone in October 1972 and is 35 years old. She is a citizen of Lebanon. His half brother \nwas born in Sierra Leone in January 1957 and is 51 years old. He is a citizen of \nLebanon. Applicant\u2019s mother, two sisters, and half brother are U.S. resident aliens \n(green card holders). (SOR \u00b6 2.a., 2.b.) GE 1, GE 2. Applicant\u2019s father was born in \nLebanon in January 1924 and was the proprietor of his privately owned textile store. His \nfather spent most of his working life in Sierra Leone, and was assisted by his wife \n(Applicant\u2019s mother) in the family business. In 1994, his father returned to Lebanon. \nDuring a visit to the U.S. in 2001, Applicant\u2019s father passed. To honor his father\u2019s \nwishes, Applicant\u2019s family interned his remains in Lebanon. Tr. 38-40, 44-45, 72-73. \n \nBefore Applicant became a U.S. citizen, he held a Lebanese passport, which he \ncontinues to maintain. He renewed his Lebanese passport, most recently in July 2004.

Applicant does not believe he could \nrenounce his Lebanese citizenship nor is he wiling to give up his Lebanese passport. \nHis purpose in keeping his Lebanese passport is ease of travel to visit his father\u2019s \ngravesite in Lebanon. Tr. 88-91. \n \nApplicant has three family members living in Lebanon, two half sisters and one \nhalf brother. His first half sister was born in February 1954 in Sierra Leone and is 54 \nyears old. His second half sister was born in April 1955 in Sierra Leone and is 53 years \nold. His half brother was born in Sierra Leone in January 1958 and is 50 years old. His \ntwo half sisters and half brother are resident citizens of Lebanon. (SOR \u00b6 2.c.) Two of \nhis other half sisters who lived in Lebanon are deceased. None of his siblings are \nemployed by or associated with the Lebanese government. Applicant described them as \napolitical and more focused on day to day survival. Tr. 68-70. \n \nApplicant \u201cmaintain[s] phone contacts mainly with [his] half-sisters once every \nfour to six weeks.\u201d He is not \u201con best terms\u201d with his half brother. He keeps in touch with \nhis half brother vicariously through his half sisters. GE 2, Tr. 50-51, 62-63.

Tr. 57, 79-80. \n \nApplicant has traveled to Lebanon at least three times since 1999. The first visit \nwas in November/December 1999 and was prompted after his father broke his hip. He \nwas accompanied by his wife and first born son who was one year old at the time. The \nsecond visit occurred in June 2001/July 2001, for the specific purpose of returning his \nfather\u2019s remains to Lebanon and ensuring that he was buried according to his wishes. \nTr. 43-44. The third visit was in April 2003/May 2003 for a family visit. (SOR \u00b6 2.d.) He \nhas no current plans to visit Lebanon. GE 1, GE 2, Tr. 43-46. Applicant has various \nother relatives living in Lebanon who he visited or saw during his visits to Lebanon, \nespecially during his 2003 visit. Tr. 48-49. Applicant used his Lebanese passport during \nall three of his visits. Tr. 58-59. \n \nApplicant and his wife own a condominium in a state where they used to live. \nApplicant and his family currently live in a rental apartment. He has an 401k through his \nemployer, a term life insurance policy, and estimates he has \u201cabout $300\u201d in his bank \naccounts. Applicant stated he earns an annual salary of $39,000 per year and his wife \nearns the same for a total joint income of $78,000. He is registered to vote in the U.S. \nand exercises all rights of U.S. citizenship. Tr. 80-85. \n \nLebanon1 \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Lebanon became independent \nin November 1943.  Its history since independence Ahas been marked by periods of \npolitical turmoil interspersed with prosperity.@  Since independence in 1943, Lebanon=s \nAnational policy has been determined largely by a relatively restricted group of traditional \nregional and sectarian leaders,@ and sectarianism is Aa key element of Lebanese \npolitical life.@  Furthermore, ALebanese political institutions often play a secondary role to \nhighly confessionalized personality-based politics.@ \n \nIn April 1975, full-scale civil war broke out in Lebanon, and it did not end until \n1991.  Although Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy, civil war precluded the effective \nexercise of political rights from the mid-1970s until 1992.  During the period 1992 to \n2005, post-war reconstruction in Lebanon has included social and political instability, \neconomic uncertainty, and problems with basic infrastructure, violent clashes between \nIsraeli \nmilitary \nforces \nand \nHezbollah, \nand \npolitical \nassassinations. \nPolitical \nassassinations also occurred in 2006 and 2007. \n \nAlthough Lebanon is a parliamentary republic, it has some human rights \nproblems, including: Lebanese security forces Aarbitrarily arrested and detained \nindividuals@ and Ainstances of arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life, torture, and other \nabuse.@  Lebanese law does not specifically prohibit torture, and security forces have \nabused detainees and used torture in some instances.  Although Lebanese law requires \n \n1 The contents of the Lebanon section are taken in whole or in part from Exs. I(A), I through X. \n\n \n5\njudicial warrants before arrests, except in situations involving immediate pursuit, the \ngovernment had arbitrarily arrested and detained persons.  Many provisions of the law \nconcerning the rights of persons arrested and detained are not observed in practice, \nand security forces continue the practice of arbitrary arrest and detention.  Although the \nlaw prohibits it, Lebanese authorities Afrequently interfered with the privacy of persons \nregarded as enemies of the government.@  Furthermore, A[m]ilitias and non-Lebanese \nforces operating outside the area of [Lebanon=s] central government authority frequently \nviolated citizens= privacy rights@ and A[v]arious factions used informer networks and \nmonitoring of telephones to obtain information regarding their perceived adversaries.@ \n \nALebanon=s foreign policy has been heavily influenced by neighboring Syria, \nwhich has also long influenced Lebanon=s internal polices as well.@ Syria maintained \ntroops in Lebanon from 1976 to 2005.  Even after the last Syrian troops were withdrawn \nfrom Lebanon, Syria maintained intelligence assets in Lebanon, and A Syrian influence \nin Lebanese politics remains strong.@  Syria has been designated by the United States \nas a Astate sponsor of terrorism,@ and has Acontinued to undermine Lebanon=s \nsovereignty and security through its proxies.@  On May 9, 2008, the Secretary of State \ncondemned the use of violence by illegitimate armed groups in Lebanon, and stated \nthat the legitimate authority of the Lebanese government and the institutions of the \nLebanese state were being undermined by Hezbollah and its allies, backed by Syria \nand Iran. \n \nHezbollah, a ALebanese-based radical Shia group [which] takes its ideological \ninspiration from the Iranian revolution and the teachings of the late Ayatollah Khomeini,@ \nis a U.S.-designated AForeign Terrorist Organization,@ and is described by the U.S. \nDepartment of State as Athe most technically capable terrorist group in the world.@  The \nLebanese government recognizes Hezbollah as a Alegitimate >resistance group= and \npolitical party,@ and until recently, Hezbollah was represented by elected members of \nthe Lebanese Parliament and on Lebanon=s cabinet.  AHezbollah is closely allied with \nIran and often acts at its behest,@ and Ahas helped Syria advance its political objectives \nin the region.@  Hezbollah also Aprovides support to several Palestinian terrorist \norganizations@ and Ais known to have been involved in numerous anti-U.S. and anti-\nIsraeli terrorist attacks.@   \n \nAmericans have been the targets of numerous terrorist attacks in Lebanon, and \nthe perpetrators of many of those attacks are still present in Lebanon and retain the \nability to act.  Furthermore, Palestinian groups hostile to the Lebanese government and \nthe United States operate largely autonomously inside refugee camps in different areas \nof Lebanon.  AIn addition to being subject to general Lebanese law, U.S. citizens who \nalso possess Lebanese nationality may be subject to other laws that impose special \nobligations on them as Lebanese citizens.@ \n \nA Travel Warning issued by the U.S. Department of State in May 2008 alerts \nAmerican citizens to Asecurity threats and ongoing political violence in Lebanon.@  The \nU.S. Department of State Acontinues to urge that Americans avoid all travel to \nLebanon,@ and that AAmericans who live and work in Lebanon presently should \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                     \nunderstand that they are accepting risks in remaining and carefully consider those \nrisks.@ \n \nOn May 7, 2008, Hezbollah militants blocked the road to Rafiq Hariri International \nAirport. The action rendered the airport inaccessible and travelers were unable to enter \nor leave the country via commercial air carriers. Armed Hezbollah and other opposition \nmembers proceeded to enter areas of Lebanon not traditionally under their control \nresulting in heavy fighting and a number of casualties. While there is now full access to \nthe airport and widespread hostilities have subsided, the United States is concerned \nabout Hezbollah\u2019s willingness to use violence to achieve political ends with little or no \nwarning.  \n \nThe threat of anti-Western terrorist activity exists in Lebanon; groups such as Al-\nQaeda and Jund al-Sham are present in the country and have issued statements calling \nfor attacks against Western interests in the past. There have been cases involving the \nattempted illegal export of U.S. restricted, dual use technology to Hezbollah.  In August \n2005, an individual pleaded guilty to attempting to illegally  export military night-vision \nequipment and infrared aiming devices to Hezbollah.  In November 2007, an individual \npleaded guilty to attempting to provide night vision goggles, a thermal imaging device, \nand two global positioning modules to a person in Lebanon who was purchasing \nequipment for Hezbollah. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.2 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \n2  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                     \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d3 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 9, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 sets out one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n \n3  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport. \n \n \nApplicant applied for a Lebanese passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. He \nmaintains his Lebanese passport primarily for ease of travel to visit his father\u2019s gravesite \nin Lebanon. He renewed his Lebanese passport in 2004 and it will not expire until 2009. \nHe used his Lebanese passport in lieu of his U.S. passport during visits to Lebanon in \n1999, 2001, and 2003. He understands maintaining his Lebanese citizenship and \nLebanese passport is at odds with DoD security policy. \n \n \nThree Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 11 are potentially \nmitigating to this disqualifying condition: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and  \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nHad Applicant complied with the mitigating conditions supra, especially AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n11(b) and 11(e), he could well have mitigated this concern. Having chosen to maintain \nhis Lebanese citizenship and his Lebanese passport for future travel to Lebanon \nprecludes application of these mitigating conditions. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 6, the Government\u2019s concern is:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                     \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.4 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with his two half sisters and to a lesser extent \nhis half brother living in Lebanon. Applicant feels it is important to maintain these \ncontacts. He also maintains his Lebanese citizenship and passport for ease of travel to \nLebanon especially for purposes of future visits to his father\u2019s gravesite. Applicant \nvisited Lebanon in 1999, 2001, and 2003. These contacts create a risk of foreign \npressure or attempted exploitation because there is always the possibility that \nindividuals adverse to the U.S. may exploit the opportunity to obtain information about \nthe United States. His connection to his family members also creates a potential conflict \nof interest because his relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern \nabout his desire to help them by providing sensitive or classified information.  \n \nThese close family connections create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation because of the existence of terrorists or terrorism within \nLebanon. These terrorist activities are at odds with the U.S. and U.S. interests. His \nconnections to his Lebanese family also create a potential conflict of interest because \nhis relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his possible \ndesire to help his family by providing sensitive information. In short, his connections with \nhis family members in Lebanon create a \u201cheightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n4  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that only mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient \nrelationship and loyalty to the United States, that he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States\u2019 interests. He has lived in the United \nStates for approximately 22 years. He is a naturalized U.S. citizen and all of his financial \nand business interests are in the United States. Applicant has established himself as an \nAmerican citizen and embarked on a successful career. He has a track record of diligent \nlabor as an employee of his company. Although this mitigating condition is partially \napplicable, it is insufficient to overcome the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nHe has contacts and close relationships with his two half sisters in Lebanon and \nto a lesser extent with his half brother. He remains in frequent contact with his family \nmembers in Lebanon. Applicant also has a strong bond with his late father as \ndemonstrated by his desire to maintain his Lebanese citizenship and passport for ease \nof travel to visit his gravesite.  \n \nGuidelines \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply. Applicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely \n[he] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of [his \nLebanese family] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d His frequent contacts and close \nrelationships with his Lebanese relatives could potentially force him to choose between \nthe United States and Lebanon. He did not meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle \nlikelihood that [his relationships with his Lebanese family members] could create a risk \nfor foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nThe nature of Lebanon\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nactivities within its border, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that Applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The \nrisk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has \nan authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country and/or factions within the country is known to conduct \nintelligence operations against the United States. The hostility of certain factions within \nLebanon to the United States places a \u201cvery heavy burden of persuasion\u201d on Applicant \nto demonstrate that his immediate family members in Lebanon do not pose a security \nrisk and he will not be placed into a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to \nthe United States and his Lebanese family members. With its adversarial stance and its \nnegative human rights record, it is likely that Lebanon and/or factions within Lebanon \nwould target any citizen in an attempt to gather classified or sensitive information from \nthe United States. \n \nThere is no evidence that the Lebanese government or any faction within \nLebanon has approached any of his Lebanese family for any reason, and in particular, \nhas not approached them recently about Applicant. There is no evidence that his family \nliving in Lebanon currently engages in activities which would bring attention to \nthemselves or that they are even aware of her work.  \n \nNotwithstanding, Foreign Influence mitigating conditions cannot be applied in this \ncase, and the security concerns cannot be fully mitigated because there is no reason for \nLebanon to contact his relatives about Applicant until he receives access to classified \ninformation. Even taking for granted that his Lebanese family members currently have \nlow-key non-controversial lifestyles, and that the Lebanese government and/or factions \nwithin Lebanon have not contacted them about Applicant in the past, such factors are \ninsufficient to mitigate the security concerns because of the nature of such entities and \nits relationship to the United States. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nApplicant averred his loyalty to the United States, that he considers himself to be \nan American, and his desire to continue his present work. Applicant has lived in the U.S. \nfor 22 years and has been a naturalized citizen for 11 years. When he became a U.S. \ncitizen, he swore allegiance to the United States. His mother, two sisters and one half \nbrother are U.S. permanent residents.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement about his loyalty to the United States is credible, and there \nis no reason to believe that he would take any action which could cause potential harm \nto his U.S. family or to this country. He has the respect and trust of his employer. There \nis no evidence that he has revealed to his family in Lebanon the nature of his work or \nabout applying for a security clearance.   \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant traveled to Lebanon on three separate occasions in \n1999, 2001, and 2003. He has family members, two half sisters and one half brother, \nwho are resident citizens of Lebanon. Applicant and his family enjoy a close \nrelationship. Applicant has strong ties of affection and/or obligation to his Lebanese \nfamily members. Because his family members live in Lebanon, they are vulnerable to \ncoercion or exploitation by Lebanon and/or factions within Lebanon.  \n \n \nNumerous circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. \nFor example, the threat of anti-Western terrorist activity exists in Lebanon with groups \nsuch as Al-Qaeda and Jund al-Sham present in the country and have issued statements \ncalling for attacks against Western interests. There have been cases involving the \nattempted illegal export of U.S. restricted, dual use technology to Hezbollah. Lebanon \nand/or factions within Lebanon are currently in an adversarial position with respect to \nthe United States. Applicant spent the first 19 years of his life in Lebanon and Sierra \nLeone, which can arguably be referred to as his formative years. He has family \nmembers who are Lebanese citizens living in Lebanon, and he remains in touch with \nthose relatives through frequent and non-casual direct and vicarious contact. These \ncontacts create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because there is \nalways the possibility that Lebanese agents and/or terrorists may attempt to use \nApplicant\u2019s family members living in Lebanon to obtain information about the United \nStates.  \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference and foreign influence. The evidence \nleaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nFor reasons discussed supra, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the \nconcerns arising from his foreign preference and foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph1.a. \u2013 1.c.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a. \u2013 2.d.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J.

He is married with three children, ages seven, five, and an infant less than a year old.1 The SOR lists 14 debts totaling approximately $17,817. Applicant admitted to owing all the debts. He attributed his financial difficulties to being laid off work for about two months in 2001, and then his wife was also laid off her job. He was a stay-at-home parent while his wife worked from about October 2005 through December 2006. The cost of day care was so high that it was better financially for him to stay home. His wife was again laid off in June 2008, and she has not yet returned to work.2 Applicant indicated that he plans on contacting an attorney and filing for bankruptcy, but he has not done anything yet. He accepted that he could be denied his security clearance based upon his finances and stated that he would reapply if that occurred after he brought his finances in order. He has not received any financial counseling. He does not have a complete grasp of his financial situation because his wife handles their finances.3 Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), certified as true on June 27, 2007.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nOn April 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 28, 2008, and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On June 18, 2008, Applicant \nchanged his request to a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was \nAugust 26, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nassigned to me on July 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 17, 2008. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on August 12, 2008. The Government offered \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf but did not submit any documentary evidence. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 21, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since about January 2007. He attended community college. He is \nmarried with three children, ages seven, five, and an infant less than a year old.1  \n \n \nThe SOR lists 14 debts totaling approximately $17,817. Applicant admitted to \nowing all the debts. He attributed his financial difficulties to being laid off work for about \ntwo months in 2001, and then his wife was also laid off her job. He was a stay-at-home \nparent while his wife worked from about October 2005 through December 2006. The \ncost of day care was so high that it was better financially for him to stay home. His wife \nwas again laid off in June 2008, and she has not yet returned to work.2 \n \n \nApplicant indicated that he plans on contacting an attorney and filing for \nbankruptcy, but he has not done anything yet. He accepted that he could be denied his \nsecurity clearance based upon his finances and stated that he would reapply if that \noccurred after he brought his finances in order. He has not received any financial \ncounseling. He does not have a complete grasp of his financial situation because his \nwife handles their finances.3 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), \ncertified as true on June 27, 2007. Question 28a asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you \nbeen over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Question 28b asked, \u201cAre you currently \nover 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d He answered \u201cNo\u201d to both questions.4 \nApplicant denied intentionally falsifying the SF 86: \n \nI knew my credit would be run during the course of this investigation and \nhad no intention of hiding my delinquencies. When I filled out the \nquestionnaire I thought the question asked if I had been delinquent in the \nlast 90 or 180 days in the present. I had been working very hard not to \naccrue any further debt so I answered \u201cno.\u201d5  \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 22; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 19-20, 23-26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n3 Tr. at 20-26; GE 1. \n \n4 GE 1. \n \n5 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant fully discussed his finances when he was questioned for his \nbackground investigation and when he responded to interrogatories. He was open, \nhonest, and candid about them in his testimony at the hearing. His criminal record is \nclean.6 After considering all the evidence, I find there is insufficient evidence for a \nfinding that Applicant intentionally falsified his Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions as alleged in the SOR.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 15-17; GE 2. \n \n\n \n4 \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of these \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant still owes the debts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nHe attributed his financial difficulties to his and his wife\u2019s unemployment. That could \nqualify under AG \u00b6 20(b) as conditions that were largely beyond his control. To be fully \napplicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant and his wife were unemployed in 2001. He voluntarily did not \nwork for about 14 months in 2005 and 2006, choosing to be a stay-at-home father while \nhis wife worked. His wife was laid off again in June 2006. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient information about what, if any, actions he took to resolve his finances when he \nand his wife were not involuntarily unemployed, for a finding that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling and his financial problems are \nnot resolved or under control. There is no evidence of a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors. He may file bankruptcy in the future, but his debts currently remain \nunresolved. He has not disputed any of the debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), (d), and (e) are not \napplicable.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following mitigating condition is potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n \n6 \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n \nApplicant omitted some information from his Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions; however, there is insufficient evidence to find that it was a deliberate \nomission. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a clean criminal \nrecord. He did not intentionally falsify his SF 86. His finances, however, are in disarray \nand remain a security concern. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nEdward W.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Applicant is 39 and single, though she is in a long-term relationship with the father of her children. She is employed by a defense contractor as a security administrator and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant submits that most of these debts occurred during periods of unemployment and underemployment between 1994 and 2004. The Applicant lived in State A until 1994. At that time she and her partner moved to State B, in order to improve their employment prospects, and because she was going to have a baby. They lived in State B until 2001, but their financial situation was always difficult. In 2001, the Applicant moved back to State A, where her partner subsequently joined her. She has lived in State A since that time. (Government Exhibit 5 at 8.) Since October 2004 the Applicant has been employed by her current employer, first as a temporary employee and, since March 2006, full time.

On August 6, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guidelines F, J and E concerning the Applicant.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on October 7, 2008, and requested a\nhearing.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 30, 2008.  The\ncase was assigned to another administrative judge on November 3, 2008.  I received\nthe case assignment on December 18, 2008.  DOHA issued notices of hearing on\nNovember 10, 2008, and January 8, 2009.  I convened the hearing as scheduled on\n\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit K was received on April 7, 2009.  The exhibit consists of documents that, through no fault of the\n1\nApplicant\u2019s, should have been attached to Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.  Since the addition of Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K is a strictly\nministerial act, the date the record closed does not change.\n2\nFebruary 5, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which\nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through I, also without objection.  The Applicant asked that the\nrecord remain open and, on February 23, 2009, she submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J,\nalso without objection.   DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on February 11,\n1\n2009.  The record closed on February 23, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 39 and single, though she is in a long-term relationship with the\nfather of her children.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a security\nadministrator and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her\nemployment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \nThe Applicant submits that most of these debts occurred during periods of\nunemployment and underemployment between 1994 and 2004.  The Applicant lived in\nState A until 1994.  At that time she and her partner moved to State B, in order to\nimprove their employment prospects, and because she was going to have a baby.  They\nlived in State B until 2001, but their financial situation was always difficult.  In 2001, the\nApplicant moved back to State A, where her partner subsequently joined her.  She has\nlived in State A since that time.

(Transcript at 78-79; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I at 11.)\n1.uu.  The Applicant admitted that she was indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $1,221.00.  She testified that the debt was paid, disputed to the credit\nreporting agencies and it was removed.  (Transcript at 78-80; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I at 11\nand Exhibit J at 8.)\n1.vv.  The Applicant denied owing a collection agency $3,502.00 for a past due\naccount to a bank.  She submitted evidence that a settlement had been made on this\naccount and she had paid this debt in 2007.  (Transcript at 80-81; Government Exhibit 5\nat 22.)\n1.ww., 1.xx and 1.yy.  The Applicant admits owing her current employer\u2019s dining\nfacility $454.00 for three returned checks that she cashed in 2004.  She submitted\nevidence showing she has paid approximately $221.00 towards this delinquency.\n(Transcript at 81-82; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J at 6-7.)\n1.zz.  The Applicant testified and provided evidence to show that her disposable\nincome has dropped a considerable amount since April 2008.  The garnishment\ndiscussed in 1.a., above, began in April 2008 and takes over $600.00 per month.  In\naddition, her partner was unemployed for a considerable period in 2008, and only in\nOctober 2008 did he begin working again.  She submitted a financial statement showing\nthat her disposable income was $81.42 per month as of February 2009.  (Transcript at\n81-88; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K at 4.)\n1.aaa. and 3.g.  The Applicant admitted that she had written numerous over the\nyears knowing that she did not have the funds to cover them.  This conduct began in\nState B in the 1990s, but continued after she returned to State A, as set forth under\n1.ww., 1.xx and 1.yy., above.\nIn discussing her conduct, the Applicant stated:\nYes.  I did write checks deliberately.  I mean, this was during the\ntime frame that I had moved to [State B].  I had a small - - my oldest was\nvery young.  I mean, I was - -I left pregnant and - - and we - - I left and\nthere was some Unemployment, not very much, maybe 250, if not less\nthan that, a week and - - \u2018cause I was a part-time student or part-time\nemployee and a full-time student and - - and my domestic partner, my\nchild\u2019s father, did not have a job at the time when we left and he was also\nunemployed.  So in order to my way of  - - I was just wanting to make\nends meet and buy diapers for my child, food for my child and, you know -\n- so I knew there was no funds there or not enough and I would write \u2018em\nout to either supermarkets - - basically, most of these were supermarkets\nof all - - you know, throughout [City] really, I mean, just buying what I\n\n8\nneeded as food and necessities for me and my children, so on, so - -\n(Transcript at 90-91.)\nAs a result of her history of bad check writing, the Applicant was placed on a Bad\nCheck Program in State B.  She stated that, for about a year, she had to make\npayments and restitution to the victims.  (Transcript at 91; Government Exhibit 5 at 8.)\nThe Applicant further testified that the three bad checks she wrote to her employer in\n2004 were the last ones that she has written.  (Transcript at 92-93.)\n1.bbb., 1.ccc. and 1.ddd.  These three allegations will be discussed under\nParagraph 2, below. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she has engaged in criminal conduct.  The Applicant admits all of\nthe allegations under this paragraph of the SOR.\n2.a., 1.bbb. and 3.h.  The Applicant moved to State B in early 1996.  Due to\nhaving a vehicle repossessed for non-payment, the Applicant did not have a vehicle.\nShe testified:\nI rented a mini-van and I was making payments, it was coming out\nof our credit card, but I  - - I no longer had funds or the availability to\ncontinue paying it.  So, at that time, I kept the van for maybe over 30 days\nand that\u2019s - - and it wasn\u2019t returned, so that\u2019s why it was considered a\nfelony larceny, I guess.  (Transcript at 94.)\nShe was eventually arrested for this offense and required to pay restitution to the\nrental car company.  The amount she paid was approximately $10,000.00.  (Transcript\nat 94-95.)\n2.b., 1.ccc. and 3.i.  The Applicant, also in 1996, used an intermediary to open a\nbank account in the other person\u2019s name.  The Applicant would knowingly write bad\nchecks on this account and withdraw money from ATM machines knowing there was\ninsufficient money in the account.\nThe Applicant was eventually arrested and charged with four counts of Forgery\nand one of Fraud, all felonies.  She plead guilty and was sentenced to two years\nprobation, six months of financial counseling and paid restitution of at least $3,000.00.\nHer probation was terminated early and the charge reduced to a misdemeanor.\n(Transcript at 95-96; Government Exhibit 5 at 10, 16-17.)\n2.c., 1.ddd. and 3.j.  The Applicant was arrested in 2003 for misdemeanor theft.\nIn this incident, she used a procurement card provided by her employer to buy personal\nitems.  She plead guilty and sentenced to three years informal probation, pay restitution\n\n9\nof approximately $300.00 and fined.  (Transcript at 96-97; Government Exhibit 5 at 17-\n18.) \n2.d.  This subparagraph states that the incidents described in subparagraphs 3.a.\nthrough 3.f., below, amount to criminal conduct.  Specifically, that they are cognizable\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she has engaged in conduct which shows questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  The\nApplicant admitted allegations 3.d., 3.e., 3.f., 3.g., 3.h., 3.i., and 3.j.  Those admissions\nare deemed findings of fact.\n3.a.  The Applicant filled out her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nPurposes (e-QIP) on November 1, 2006.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  Question 27.d. asks\nwhether, in the last seven years, she had any judgments against her which had not\nbeen paid.  The Applicant admitted the judgement set forth in subparagraph 1.c.  She\ndid not admit the three other judgments set forth in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.dd.\nThis was a false answer to a relevant question regarding the Applicant\u2019s financial\nsituation.  The Applicant had no good response as to why she did not admit these\nadditional judgments.  Her main argument was that she knew the Government would\npull a credit report on her and then she would answer questions.  (Transcript at 97-101.)\n3.b.  Question 27.d.2. of Government Exhibit 1 asks the Applicant to provide\ndetails for the judgment set forth in subparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant stated that the\njudgment had been paid.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D seems to indicate that the judgment was\npaid in 2008.  The Applicant testified that, in reality, this judgment was paid before 2006,\nbut she did not request a letter about it until 2008.  That argument, under the\ncircumstances of this case, is credible and worthy of belief.  (Transcript at 101-103.)\nThis subparagraph is found for the Applicant.\n3.c.  Question 28.a. of Government Exhibit 1 asks the Applicant whether, within\nthe last seven years, she had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts.  She\nstated, \u201cYes,\u201d and discussed a vehicle loan that had been brought current.  She did not\nstate any of the numerous delinquent debts described under Paragraph 1, above.  This\nanswer was, therefore, false.  The Applicant stated that she did not have a copy of her\ncredit report, and did not know what kind of debts were on there.  (Transcript at 103-\n104.)\n3.d.  Question 28.b. of Government Exhibit 1 asks the Applicant whether she was\ncurrently more than 90 days delinquent on any of her debts.  She did not state any of\nthe numerous delinquent debts described under Paragraph 1, above.  This answer was,\ntherefore, false.  (Transcript at 104-105.)\n\n10\n3.e.  Question 23.a. of Government Exhibit 1 asks the Applicant whether she had\never been charged with any felony offense.  She answered, No.\u201d  This answer was false\nbecause the Applicant had been charged and convicted of felonies as set forth in\nsubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.  She testified that she had been advised by another person\nin the security department to only go back seven years on her questionnaire.\n(Transcript at 105-106.)\n3.f.  In 2003, as stated above under subparagraph 2.c., the Applicant misused a\nprocurement card from her employer.  She subsequently was laid off from the job.  In\nher questionnaire, Government Exhibit 1, at question 22, concerning this employment,\nshe states that she, \u201cLeft a job by mutual agreement following allegations of\nmisconduct.\u201d\nThe Applicant filled out interrogatories in 2008.  The Applicant described the\nsame incident as follows at question 11, \u201cDue to the incident [at] [place of employment] I\nwasn\u2019t fired, it was due to the budget crisis in [State A].  If I had been fired I wouldn\u2019t\nhave been able to collect unemployment.  Unemployment benefits were collected for 1\nyear.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 5 at 6.)\nThe Applicant testified at length about this incident.  (Transcript at 106-111.)\nBased on my analysis of all the available evidence, I find that the Applicant did not\nintend to deceive the Government as to why she was dismissed from this job.  Her\nanswer on Government Exhibit 1 put the Government on notice that this was an area\nthat needed investigation.  This subparagraph is found for the Applicant.\nMitigation\nThe Applicant\u2019s supervisor submitted a letter on her behalf.  The supervisor\nstates, \u201cI have found [the Applicant] to be intelligent, capable, dedicated, and\npersonable woman.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)\nThe Applicant submitted her job evaluations.  They show that she \u201cConsistently\nMeets Expectations.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B and Exhibit C.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\n\n11\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\n\n12\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by her own admission, had over $44,512.13 in past\ndue debts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily between about 1994 and 2004.  However, she only\nbegan paying the debts in 2006, and only when her employer suggested that she do so.\nWhile she has made strides in paying her indebtedness, the fact that she had so many\nbad debts, for so long, and did nothing to pay them until a little over two years ago, is\nstill troubling.  This mitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn . . .), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  The Applicant argues that many of these debts\ncame from unemployment or underemployment.  However, there is evidence that she\nwillfully ignored her responsibilities and, as described in subparagraphs 1.bbb., 1.ccc.\nand 1.ddd., was not afraid to act criminally if she felt it necessary.  I cannot find, under\nthese particular facts, that the Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances.\nThe Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off her creditors.  The\nevidence shows that she has paid off approximately $27,149.52 of her indebtedness to\n26 creditors.  She continues to owe approximately $17,362.31, to 18 creditors.  AG \u00b6\n20(d) is arguably applicable.\nAG \u00b6 20(c) states that it may be mitigating where, \u201cthere are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  The Applicant last act of passing a\nbad check occurred in 2004.  Her past due indebtedness appears to all predate 2004.\nShe is slowly paying her past due indebtedness.  This mitigating condition is arguably\napplicable.\nI have weighed the Applicant\u2019s conduct prior to 2004 against her actions in\npaying many of her accounts in the last two years.  In addition, I have looked at the\ncircumstances in which she allowed this conduct to occur, particularly writing bad\n\n13\nchecks, opening a bank account under a false name and stealing a car because she felt\nshe needed to for her child.  The record evidence shows little remorse or understanding\non the part of the Applicant about why her conduct was inappropriate.  While she is\npaying her debts off, and is to be commended for that, I find that it is still too soon, given\nthe other circumstances of this case, to find that this conduct may not recur in the\nfuture.  Paragraph 1 is found against the Applicant.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30:      \nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant was involved in several criminal incidents over the years.  What is\nstriking about them is that they all related to financial crimes.  AG \u00b6 31(a) applies to this\ncase, stating that a disqualifying condition is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 33.(a) stated that it may be mitigating where, \u201cso much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d  The last criminal incident occurred in\n2003, when she misused an employer\u2019s procurement card.  However, repeatedly the\nApplicant has shown a proclivity towards illegal acts when pressured financially.  I see\nlittle indication that her personality has changed to the point that she would avoid such\nconduct again.  This mitigating condition is not applicable.\nI find little, if any, remorse or understanding of what she did, and why it is wrong.\nAG \u00b6 33.(d) is not currently applicable.  Under the particular circumstances of this case,\nat this point in time, using the clearly consistent standard, I must find this paragraph\nagainst the Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n14\nAG \u00b6 16(a) states that it may be disqualifying where an Applicant engages in the\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d  \nThe Applicant\u2019s e-QIP is riddled with false and misleading answers.  She argues\nthat it was either the result of her taking bad advice (that she only had to go back seven\nyears on her questionnaire) or that she did not have all the information (not telling the\nGovernment that she had over 30 bad debts).  The Applicant works in the security\ndepartment, and knew or should have known that her answers were, at the very least,\nmisleading.  Under other circumstances, the Applicant\u2019s false answers could have been\nseen as mistakes.  However, the Applicant has little credibility.  As shown above, she is\nnot adverse to using fraud or theft to her advantage.  None of the mitigating conditions\napply.  Based on the record, I find the Applicant intentionally falsified her answers as set\nforth in subparagraphs 3.a., 3.c., 3.d., and 3.e.  \nSubparagraphs 3.g., 3.h., 3.i., and 3.j., state that conduct of the Applicant which\nis specifically discussed under Paragraphs 1 and 2, above, are also cognizable under\nthis paragraph.  The personal conduct described here is sufficient to justify denial of\nsecurity clearance under this paragraph as well.  AG \u00b6 16.(c) applies: \nCredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information.\nBased on all of the information set forth above, Paragraph 3 is found against the\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\n\n15\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), all of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct, financial, criminal, and personal, is frequent and relatively recent.\nBased on the state of the record, I cannot find that there have been permanent\nbehavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the present time, I cannot find\nthat there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6\n2(a)(8)), or that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her\nFinancial Considerations, Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Government's\nStatement of Reasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n16\nSubparagraph 1.r.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.aa.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.bb.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.cc.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.dd.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ee.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ff..:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.gg.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.hh.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ii.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.jj.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.kk.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ll.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.mm.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.nn.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.oo.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.pp.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.qq.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.rr.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ss.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.tt.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.uu.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.vv.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ww.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.xx.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.yy.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.zz.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.aaa.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.bbb.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ccc.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ddd.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n17\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.f.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

In \n1997, Applicant moved to the United Kingdom at the behest of his company. In 2004, he \nbecame a citizen of the United Kingdom. Between 2004 and 2007, he voted in a U.K. \nelection, used U.K. medical benefits, and obtained a U.K. passport. When he learned \nthese preferences for the United Kingdom raised a serious security concern, he gave \nhis U.K. passport to his security manager, and renounced his U.K. citizenship. He now \nlives in the United States, and participates in U.S. elections. He has substantial \ninvestments in the United States and relatively minimal investments in Spain and the \nUnited Kingdom. Foreign preference security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 18, 2008, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (e-QIP \nversion) (hereinafter SF-86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On March 10, 2009, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto him, alleging security concerns under Guideline C, Foreign Preference (GE 5). The \nSeptember 16, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                             \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 26, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge (GE 6). On May 13, 2009, Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed. On May 15, 2009, the case was assigned to me. On May 19, \n2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice setting the hearing for June 9, 2009 (GE 4). The \nhearing was held on June 9, 2009, as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel \noffered three exhibits (GE 1-3) (Transcript (Tr.) 20), and Applicant offered six exhibits \n(Tr. 22-24; AE A-F). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-3 (Tr. 20-21), and \nAE A-F (Tr. 22-24). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and the \nhearing notice (GE 4-6). On June 17, 2009, I received the hearing transcript. I granted \nseveral post-hearing delays to give Applicant time to divest himself of his property and \nbank accounts in the United Kingdom and to renounce his U.K. citizenship (Tr. 116, \n143, 145). On August 14, 2009, Department Counsel provided AE G-S to me, and \nindicated there was no objection to admission of AE G-S into evidence. On August 15, \n2009, I admitted AE G-S into evidence and closed the record that same day. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nApplicant and Department Counsel did not object to me taking administrative \nnotice of some facts about the relationship between the United States and the United \nKingdom (Tr. 117). See the United Kingdom section of the Findings of Fact of this \ndecision, infra, for the facts administratively noticed. The information administratively \nnoticed is from \u201cBackground Note: United Kingdom,\u201d (March 2009), from the U.S. \nDepartment of State website. The documents from the Department of State website \npertaining to the United Kingdom are labeled Hearing Exhibit I and attached to \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice in ISCR \nproceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types \nof facts for administrative notice).  \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in his response to the SOR with \nexplanations (GE 6). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of \nfact.   \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old engineer employed by a large government contractor \n(Tr. 6, 25). The same government contractor has employed him for 32 years (Tr. 25). \nHe advises and assists about 50 engineers (Tr. 27). He earned a master\u2019s degree in \nelectronic engineering in 1977 (Tr. 6). Applicant has held a Secret clearance since the \nlate 1970s (Tr. 7, 45). When necessary, he has also held a Top Secret clearance and \naccess to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) (Tr. 45). In 1985, his SCI access \nwas revoked because of his mother\u2019s connections to Spain (Tr. 46). He does not have \nany children (Tr. 115). \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen at birth (Tr. 26). When he was nine, he and his \nfamily moved to Spain (Tr. 27, 28). When he was 11, he moved to England (Tr. 27, 28). \nHe lived in England until he was 18 (Tr. 28). In England, he attended an American \ncurriculum school, and his classmates were all Americans (Tr. 28). Around 1973, he \nreturned to the United States. He attended college in the United States and earned his \nbachelor and master\u2019s degrees (Tr. 29). He has never served in the U.S. military (GE 1). \nApplicant has two brothers, who were both born in the United States (Tr. 86). One of his \nbrothers has dual U.K. and U.S. citizenship (Tr. 86). Both of his brothers currently live in \nthe United States (Tr. 115). All of his aunts, uncles, and cousins on his father\u2019s side of \nthe family live in the United States (Tr. 115). \n \nIn 1997, Applicant moved back to England on behalf of his corporate employer \n(Tr. 30). Approximately every two years, his employer asked him to extend his stay in \nEngland, and Applicant agreed to do so (Tr. 31). Every couple of years, Applicant \nrenewed his U.K. work permit, and his company paid the renewal fees (Tr. 60-61). In \n2007, Applicant moved back to the United States (Tr. 31).      \n \nApplicant married in 1991 and divorced in 2000 (Tr. 33; GE 1). His former spouse \nwas a U.S. citizen (GE 1). He is not currently married. Applicant owns a rental property \nin the United States that he purchased in 1989 (Tr. 33). His U.S. property does not have \na mortgage and is worth about $350,000 (Tr. 34). Applicant has several U.S. \ninvestments in mutual fund-type and brokerage-type accounts (Tr. 35). His net worth is \nabout $3.5 million (Tr. 36). At his hearing, Applicant estimated 85 percent of his net \nworth was invested in the United States (Tr. 36). Because he did not need the money \nthat was in his foreign accounts, he did not withdrawals any funds from them (Tr. 112). \nHe offered to close the foreign accounts upon request (Tr. 112). Applicant has traveled \nthroughout Europe on several occasions and to Africa (Tr. 57-59).  \n \n \n1The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses or locations \nin order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information. \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                             \nIn the 1940\u2019s, Applicant\u2019s mother moved to the United States from Spain (Tr. \n108). His mother\u2019s brother also came to the United States and married a U.S. citizen \n(Tr. 109). His mother\u2019s brother\u2019s children were born in the United States (Tr. 109).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and mother moved to Spain in 2000 or 2001 (Tr. 63). His \nmother died in 2002. His father is an 87-year-old, blind, U.S. citizen (Tr. 63-65; GE 1). \nHis father once owned three properties in the United States; however, his father \nsubsequently sold his U.S. properties (Tr. 87). Applicant\u2019s father was probably allowed \nto remain in Spain because of his mother\u2019s Spanish citizenship (Tr. 69). \n \nForeign preference and the United Kingdom \n \nApplicant sought citizenship in the United Kingdom in 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Tr. 47, \n53-56). When he applied for U.K. citizenship, he did not know his security clearance \nwas still in effect because he had not actually had access to classified information for \nabout eight years (Tr. 97, 132-133). He applied for the U.K. passport because it would \nfacilitate travel throughout Europe (Tr. 62; AE B). He applied for U.K. citizenship \nbecause his friends recommended that he essentially become a citizen of Europe (Tr. \n99-100; AE B). Another factor was he noted that his father\u2019s life in Spain was very \ncomfortable under the circumstances (Tr. 101). Applicant was considering retiring in \nEurope (Tr. 81). He did not remember the specifics of the ceremony where his U.K. \ncitizenship was approved (Tr. 56). On June 16, 2009, Applicant paid a $765 fee and \nfiled to renounce his U.K. citizenship (AE G, H). On June 23, 2009, the U.K. embassy \nacknowledged receipt of his application to renounce his citizenship (AE I). On August 7, \n2009, a representative of the U.K. government informed Applicant that he ceased to be \na U.K. citizen effective August 7, 2009 (AE S).  \n \nOn May 26, 2005, Applicant\u2019s U.K. passport was issued, and it is scheduled to \nexpire on May 26, 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Tr. 47-48; GE 2). He kept the security office \ninformed about applying for a U.K. passport, and he was ready to relinquish his U.K. \npassport if it was deemed to cause a security problem (Tr. 68). He brought his U.K. \npassport to a meeting with an investigator in case the investigator wanted to keep it; \nhowever, the investigator did not ask for it (Tr. 98). He offered to relinquish his U.K. \npassport; however, no one specifically told him that it was very important for him to \nrelinquish his U.K. passport (Tr. 135-136). He used the U.K. passport to enter the \nUnited Kingdom (Tr. 83). He did not exclusively use his U.K. passport for his foreign \ntravel. For example, he used his U.S. passport to travel in Africa after receiving his U.K. \npassport, and to enter the United States (Tr. 83-85). On May 19, 2009, Applicant \nsurrendered his U.K. passport to his facility security officer (Tr. 48, 96; AE A). \n   \nIn May 2005, Applicant voted in a U.K. election (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Tr. 72-74). He made \nan effort to vote in U.S. elections while he lived in the U.K.; however, the U.S. absentee \nballots arrived too late for him to vote (Tr. 74-76). Since returning to the U.S. in 2007, \nApplicant has not voted in any U.K. elections, and he has voted in a U.S. election (Tr. \n76).  \n \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant received healthcare benefits funded by the U.K. government (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d; Tr. 65-66, 76-77). The healthcare benefits in the U.K. are available to all and are \nnot limited to those holding U.K. citizenship (Tr. 67, 140-141).  \n \nSince September 2002, Applicant has co-owned a house in the United Kingdom \nthat he inherited (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Tr. 85). His share of the U.K. home was one sixth (Tr. 36). \nWhen there is a tenant in the property, the monthly rent is about $5,600 (Tr. 42). He \npaid an annual income tax to the United Kingdom on the rent derived from the property \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e; Tr. 78-79). However, the U.K. taxes paid were subsequently refunded (Tr. \n87). He is attempting to ensure his foreign tax paid was accurately and appropriately \nreflected on his U.S. tax return (Tr. 79). Since approximately 1997, Applicant maintained \ntwo bank accounts in the United Kingdom with an estimated $10,000 in his bank \naccounts (SOR \u00b6 1.h; Tr. 37-38). After his hearing, he closed his bank accounts in the \nUnited Kingdom (AE G). He wanted to sell his real estate interests in the United \nKingdom; however, he was not able to do so. His family members, who also own a \nshare of the properties, would not consent to a sale while the real estate market is in \nrecession (AE G).   \n \nApplicant said he has always been willing to renounce his U.K. citizenship upon \nrequest of security officials (Tr. 96-99). He investigated the process for renouncing his \nU.K. citizenship (Tr. 114). He does not intend to live permanently in the United Kingdom \n(Tr. 103). He has not purchased property in the United Kingdom (Tr. 103-104). He is \nlooking into purchasing real estate in the United States (Tr. 105). \n \nForeign preference and Spain \n  \nSince September 2002, Applicant has co-owned a condominium (condo) in Spain \nvalued at about $150,000 that he inherited (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g; Tr. 36-38, 85). His \nfather lives in the condo (Tr. 37). Some tax was withheld from his bank statement and \nApplicant is researching whether he can get a refund (Tr. 88-89). Since approximately \n2002, Applicant maintained two bank accounts in Spain with a current estimated \nbalance of $110,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.i; Tr. 37-38). He has a part ownership in a time share \n(similar to a hotel room) in Spain (Tr. 37). He has never used the time-share property \n(Tr. 90). After his hearing, Applicant closed his bank accounts in Spain (AE G). He \nwanted to sell his real estate interests in Spain; however, he was not able to do so. His \nfamily members, who also own a share of the properties, would not consent to a sale \nwhile the real estate market is in recession (AE G).   \n   \nCharacter evidence \n \nApplicant provided several character statements from friends, colleagues and a \nsupervisor (AE C-F). Some have known Applicant for many years. They emphasize his \nloyalty to the United States, dedication, integrity, trustworthiness, and professionalism. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                             \nUnited Kingdom \n \n \n \nThe United Kingdom has a lengthy democratic tradition, and follows the rule of \nlaw. It is a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The \nUnited Kingdom is a nuclear power and a permanent member of the United Nations\u2019 \nSecurity Council. The State Department succinctly summarizes the national security \nrelationship between the United States and the United Kingdom: \n \nThe United Kingdom stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States \nfollowing the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., and its \nmilitary forces are part of the coalition force in Afghanistan. The U.K. force \nin Afghanistan stood at 8,300 as of March 1, 2009. U.K. forces are \nprimarily based in the Helmand region, where they are on the front line in \nthe war against continued Taliban operations. In addition, the U.K. has \ncontributed more than \u00a3510 million (approximately $723.4 million) to \nAfghan reconstruction\u2014the second-largest donor after the United States. \nThe U.K. was the United States\u2019 main coalition partner in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and continues to have troops deployed in Iraq to help stabilize \nand rebuild the country.  \n \n   \nThe United Kingdom is one of the United States\u2019 closest allies. The two countries \nwere allies in two World Wars, the Korean War, the Cold War, and the first Persian Gulf \nWar. This close relationship is enhanced by common language, ideals, and democratic \npractices. In addition to being an important trading partner, the United States and the \nUnited Kingdom share the world\u2019s largest foreign direct investment partnership. In 2007, \nthe United Kingdom\u2019s investment in the United States totaled $411 billion and sustained \nmore than one million U.S. jobs. In 2007, the United States\u2019 investment in the United \nKingdom totaled $399 billion.        \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                             \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude Guideline C (Foreign Preference) is the relevant security concern with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                             \nForeign Preference \n \nAG \u00b6 9 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about foreign preference, stating, \n\u201cwhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country \nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d Conditions under AG \u00b6 \n10 that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case include: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests \nin another country; \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and  \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election. \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen by virtue of his birth in the United States. His \nparents took him to the United Kingdom and Spain when he was a minor. After \ncompletion of his secondary education, Applicant returned to the United States and \nearned his bachelor and master\u2019s degrees. In 1997, he returned to the United Kingdom \nat the behest of his government contractor employer. In 2004, he became a U.K. citizen. \nHis residency in the U.K. was one factor that supported the United Kingdom\u2019s decision \nto grant him U.K. citizenship. He lived in the U.K. from 2004 to 2007, and received the \nbenefits and performed the obligations of a U.K. citizen. For example, he voted in a U.K. \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                             \nelection, received U.K. medical benefits, and obtained and used a U.K. passport. \nDisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1), 10(a)(3), 10(a)(4), and 10(a)(7) apply. \nThe decision to become a U.K. citizen as a mature adult and U.S. citizen, as well as \nstatements necessarily made in connection with obtaining U.K. citizenship, establish AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 10(b) and 10(d).  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 11, conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n  \nApplicant exercised the rights, privileges, and obligations of U.K. citizenship from \n2004 to 2007. Applicant moved back to the United States in 2007. On May 19, 2009, \nApplicant surrendered his U.K. passport to his facility security officer. In June 2009, \nApplicant applied to renounce his U.K. citizenship. On August 7, 2009, an agent of the \nU.K. government informed Applicant that he ceased to be a U.K. citizen effective August \n7, 2009. Applicant divested himself of his bank accounts in Spain and the United \nKingdom. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and 11(e) apply. Foreign preference security concerns are more \nfully mitigated under the Whole Person Concept, infra. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline C in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThe security concern relating to Spain is mitigated. Applicant\u2019s connections to \nSpain relate to his elderly father living in a condo in Spain, and Applicant\u2019s part \nownership of that condo as well as his part ownership of a time-share property in Spain. \nApplicant attempted to divest himself of his property in Spain; however, he was not able \nto do so because of objections from his family members, who are co-owners. Applicant \nis not a citizen of Spain, and his connections to Spain are limited. Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to the United States are relatively strong, and the evidence of foreign \nconnections or preferences relating to Spain is very limited.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United Kingdom, and the attributes of foreign \npreference relating to the United Kingdom raised a bona fide security concern. He \nobtained and used a U.K. passport, became a U.K. citizen in 2004, and enjoyed the \nattributes and obligations of U.K. citizenship from 2004 to 2007. He received medical \nbenefits from the U.K. government and voted in a U.K. election. However, once he \nlearned that his actions relating to the United Kingdom raised a security concern, he \nacted decisively to cut those ties to the United Kingdom. He surrendered his U.K. \npassport to his facility security officer, renounced his U.K. citizenship, and closed his \nU.K. bank accounts.    \n \nA Guideline C decision concerning the United Kingdom does not require \nconsideration of the geopolitical situations in the United Kingdom, or the dangers \nexisting or not existing in the United Kingdom.2 The relationship between the United \nStates and the United Kingdom is especially close in the area of national security. From \nthe time when the United States joined the allies in  World War I in 1916 to the present \ntime, the United Kingdom has been one of the United States\u2019 closest military and \ndiplomatic allies. Through many of those years, the United States and the United \nKingdom confronted the Soviet Union and its satellite countries in Central Europe as \npart of NATO. Thousands of U.K. military personnel have trained in the United States, \nand fought along with U.S. military personnel over more than nine decades. Currently, \nU.K. and U.S. military personnel serve together under combat conditions in Afghanistan \nand Iraq. The U.S. operates bases in the U.K. This very close relationship is one of \n \n2 See Generally ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of \ninsufficient discussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion for \nGuideline B case). There are no Appeal Board decisions that require a similar analysis of geopolitical \nmatters. \n  \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nmutual trust, where highly classified information is routinely shared between the United \nKingdom and the United States. It is extraordinarily unlikely that officials of the United \nKingdom government would ask Applicant to compromise classified information.      \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States is stronger than his relationship \nwith the United Kingdom or any other foreign country. He was born in the United States. \nHe asserts citizenship in one country, the United States. His father and siblings are U.S. \ncitizens. Applicant has chosen to live in the United States. The United States has \nprovided his post-secondary education. He pays taxes to the United States. He owns \nreal estate in the United States and has about 3.5 million dollars invested in U.S. \ncompanies. Both of his siblings live in the United States. He has worked for more than \n30 years for a U.S. defense contractor, contributing to the national defense of the United \nStates. He recently voted in a U.S. election. I am confident he would inform security \nauthorities of any attempt to obtain classified information from him.  \n \nApplicant provided statements from friends, colleagues and supervisors. His \ncharacter \nreferences \nevidence \nhis \ndedication, \nresponsibility, \ntrustworthiness, \nprofessionalism, reliability, and integrity. Although the possibility of attempted \nexploitation of Applicant is very low, Applicant\u2019s strong connections to the United States \nand especially to his U.S. defense-related employment establish \u201csuch deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d   \n \nAfter weighing the evidence of his connections to and preference for the United \nKingdom, Spain, and the United States, and all the facts in this decision, I conclude \nApplicant has carried his burden of mitigating the foreign preference security concerns. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, all the evidence in this decision, and my interpretation of my responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:    \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.i:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n3See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

On May 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 6, 2008, and requested a \nhearing. DOHA initially assigned the case to another administrative judge and on July 2, \nSeptember 16, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n2008, reassigned it to me. On July 15, 2008, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing and the \ncase was heard on July 29, 2008, as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 5 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits \n(AE) A through G into evidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left \nthe record open until August 14, 2008, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit \nadditional information. On that day, Applicant submitted eight exhibits that were marked \nas AE H through O, and admitted into the record without objection by the Government. \nOn August 22, 2008, she submitted additional exhibits that I incorporated into AE J and \nAE M without objection from Department Counsel. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on August 15, 2008.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations, except those \ncontained in \u00b6\u00b6 1a, 1.b and 1.m. Her admissions are incorporated into the following \nfindings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and unmarried. From 1969 to 1988, she taught \nelementary education. In 1989, she began a position with Electronic Data Systems \nwhere she worked until September 1999 when she was required to retire. In 2000, she \nwithdrew $30,000 from her Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and used credit cards \nfor living expenses. (Tr. 44).   \n \n \nOver the course of the next four years, Applicant had several low paying retail \njobs, including a courier job she started in early spring of 2002. In October 2003, she \nfound another position as a technical writer and earned a $44,000 salary. She was in \nthat position until December 2005 when she was laid off. She then collected \nunemployment compensation for a couple months before finding another retail position \nat $10.50 per hour. In July 2007, she obtained her current position as a technical writer \nfor a federal contractor. Her annual salary is $41,000. (GE 1; Tr. 50).  \n \n \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to periods of under-employment and \nsome unemployment after her retirement. She believes the current tax liabilities are for \nthe years 2000 and 2001, and include the taxes that arose subsequent to the \nwithdrawal of monies from her retirement fund, in addition to penalties and interest for \nthe last several years.1 (Tr. 84-85). After she retired, she sought financial counseling to \nlearn if there were steps she could take to live frugally and manage her finances. (Tr. \n75). In March 2008, she completed a set of Financial Interrogatories regarding her \ndelinquent debts. She also prepared a budget with the assistance of a debt \nconsolidation company with which she was working to repay one debt. According to that \nbudget, her net monthly income was $2,400 and expenses were $1,939, leaving $565 \navailable for debt repayment. (GE 2). While testifying, she indicated that her net monthly \n                                            \n1In 2000, she had a tax liability of $5,276, of which $3,000 is related to her retirement withdrawal. \nThere is no evidence indicating what Applicant\u2019s tax liability was for 2001, a year in which she was \nunemployed. \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nincome is $2,400, and her expenses are about $2,000, leaving a remainder of $400. \nShe submitted a budget, post-hearing, listing her expenses as $2,680, excluding taxes, \nhealth insurance and a 401(k) contribution, and including $300 for debt repayment and \na $400 payment to her attorney. Based on that budget, it appears that her expenses \nexceed her income by $280. (AE O).   \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 16 debts, totaling $262,000, several of which are duplicates, \nand includes an $113,740 foreclosure. The status of those debts is as follows: \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1. a alleges a $598 tax lien filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \non February 12, 2007. (GE 4). The year of the tax liability appears to be 2006. \nShe presented an April 2008 letter to the IRS requesting that her refund for \n2007 be applied to her tax liability for 2006. (AE H). On June 4, 2008, \nApplicant hired a lawyer to resolve all tax matters alleged in the SOR. (AE F; \nTr. 53). It remains unresolved. \n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1. b alleges a $598 tax lien filed by the IRS on March 12, 2007. It does \nnot appear to be a duplicate of the above, as it has a different identification \nnumber. (GE 4). It is unresolved. \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a $42,742 tax lien filed by the IRS on September 10, 2007. \n(GE 3). It is unresolved. \n \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges another $42,742 tax lien filed by the IRS on September 12, \n2007, and has a different serial number from the one filed on September 10, \n2007. (GE 3). It is unresolved. \n \n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a $3,431 debt owed to a credit card company. As of March \n2008, she began paying $69 monthly per a debt repayment plan. (GE 2; Tr. \n55). \n \n6. SOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a $117 debt owed to a collection agency for a telephone \nbill. After contacting the creditor on August 7, 2008, she learned that this debt \nand the following debt are the same. She intended to mail a $418 payment on \nAugust 31, 2008, to resolve this debt. (AE N).  \n \n7. SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a $441 debt owed to a telephone company as mentioned \nabove. She is resolving it with a $418 payment. (AE N). \n \n8. SOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a $5,020 debt owed on an automobile loan. She will \nresolve it after the tax matters are cleared up. (Tr. 58). It remains unresolved. \n \n9. SOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a $9,177 debt owed to a creditor. The balance on the \naccount is $16,048. (AE J). She previously paid on the account from April \n2004 to December 2005, until she lost her job. (Tr. 26). This is the same debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o, as identified by the same account numbers.  (Tr. 61; \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nGE 5 at 10 & 12). She telephoned the law firm handling the account and \nrequested written confirmation that this debt is a duplicate of the one alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.o. (AE J). She paid $200 on June 1, 2008, to the firm handling the \naccount. (AE G). This account is being resolved. \n \n10.  SOR \u00b6 1.j alleges a $47 debt owed to a creditor. Applicant telephoned the \ncreditor on August 6, 2008, and confirmed that is the same debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.l and \u00b6 1.n.  She paid it on August 19, 2008. (AE M).  \n \n11.  SOR \u00b6 1.k alleges a $21,065 debt owed to a collection agency. It is the same \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p. (AE L). It is unresolved. \n \n12.  SOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a $119 debt. It is the same debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j and \u00b6 \n1.n. This debt was paid on August 19, 2008. (AE M). \n \n13. SOR \u00b6 1.m alleges an $113,740 debt for a mortgage on her former residence \nthat went into foreclosure in 2003. Applicant stated this was resolved upon \nthe sale of her house. (Tr. 29; AE K). An October 2007 CBR confirms that. It \nstates, \u201cForeclosure redeemed; Status: closed.\u201d (GE 5). However, an April \n2008 CRB, lists the account as open. (GE 4). Based on her testimony, and \nthe October 2007 CBR, this debt appears to be resolved.2  \n \n14.  SOR \u00b6 1.n. alleges a $56 debt. This is the same debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j \nand \u00b6 1.l.  It is paid. (AE M). \n \n15. SOR \u00b6 1.o alleges a $10,510 debt owed to a credit card company. This is the \nsame debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i as identified by the account numbers in a \nCBR.  (Tr. 61; GE 5 at 10 & 12). She paid $200 on this account in June 2008. \n \n16. SOR \u00b6 1.p alleges an $11,411 debt owed to a credit card company. It is a \nduplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. (AE L). It remains unresolved. \n \n \nIn summary, all of the debts listed above, except two, are being addressed, but \nnot necessarily resolved. Applicant hired a lawyer in June 2008 to handle the four tax \nliens, listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. They remain unresolved. She resolved her mortgage, \nlisted in \u00b6 1.m. She is paying two debts, one alleged in \u00b6 1.e, and another listed in both \n\u00b6 1.i and \u00b6 1.o. At the end of August 2008, she was going to pay the debt listed in \u00b6 1. f \nand \u00b6 1.g. She paid one debt listed in \u00b6 1.j, \u00b6 1.l, and \u00b6 1.n.  The $5,020 debt alleged in \n\u00b6 1.h, and a debt alleged under both \u00b6 1.k for $21,065 and \u00b6 1.p for $11,411 are \nunresolved. \n  \n                                            \n2 There is no evidence that the mortgage company sought a judgment against Applicant for \nunpaid monies. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nApplicant was very candid and credible during her presentation. She operates on \na very tight budget. She no longer uses credit cards, but instead relies on a debit card. \n(Tr. 81). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and the \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and maybe \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant began accumulating a significant amount of delinquent debt after she \nretired and withdrew $30,000 from her IRA in 2000, and began using credit cards for \nliving expenses. Those debts continued to accrue through 2001, and included the \nforeclosure on her home in 2003. Many of the debts remain unresolved. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these two potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose in 2000 and continue into 2008. Because \nthe problems have been ongoing for almost eight years, AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot apply. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) has some application. Applicant\u2019s debts began accumulating as a result of several \nyears of under-employment and a short period of unemployment. Those circumstances \nwere outside of her control. She did not present any substantive evidence that she \nattempted to manage the debts during those difficult periods or subsequent to them. \nThus, I find this potentially mitigating condition has limited application.  \n \nApplicant presented evidence that she obtained credit counseling in 2000. She \nhas resolved several debts and is trying to resolve other debts. Based on her recently \nsubmitted budget, it is not clear that her monthly income can accommodate her monthly \nexpenses and indicates that her financial obligations are not yet under control, as \nrequired under AG \u00b6 20(c). Hence, this mitigating condition has limited application.  \n \nApplicant sought professional assistance for the resolution of the four tax liens, \nalleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d of the SOR. However, she has no knowledge of the \ncurrent status of those liens since employing the lawyer in June. She resolved the \nmortgage allegation. She paid one debt, and intended to pay another debt at the end of \nAugust (which I believe she would have done). She is making monthly payments on two \ndebts. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) should be given some consideration for her good-faith \nefforts to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f and 1.g, 1.i and 1.o, 1.m, and 1.j, \n1.l, and 1.n. \n \nThe evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 20(e) and AG \u00b6 20(f).   \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 59-year-old woman \nwith a long work history, who started experiencing financial difficulties in 2000 after she \nretired and decided to withdraw monies from her retirement funds and use credit cards \nfor living expenses. She then remained unemployed for about two years before finding \nemployment. She then held, for periods of time, low paying jobs outside of her \nexpertise, further exacerbating her financial problems. Prior to 2000, she had not \nexperienced financial difficulties. \n \nApplicant credibly acknowledged her debts and expressed a desire to resolve \nthem. However, she did not take steps to address the majority of the debts until the last \nmonth or so, despite learning in March 2008 that the Government had concerns about \nher financial obligations. After receiving the May 2008 SOR, she called a lawyer in June \n2008 to investigate her unpaid taxes from 2000 and 2001. As of the hearing date, she \ndid not have any information as to the status of the liens. While all of her recent efforts \nare having a positive effect in resolving her outstanding obligations, the fact that she \nwaited several years to address them, in particular her taxes, raises questions about her \njudgment and reliability. At this time, there is at least $43,000 in unpaid taxes and \n$16,000 to $26,000 of unresolved credit card debt. The Appeal Board noted in ISCR \nCase No. 06-12930, \u201cthat an applicant is not required to show that she has completely \npaid off her indebtedness, only that she has established a reasonable plan to resolve \nher debts and has taken \u2018significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 ISCR Case No.04-\n09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul.6, 2006).\u2019\u201d In this case, Applicant has not yet established a \nplan to resolve all of her debts that have been known to her and outstanding for several \nyears. For these reasons, I am concerned that similar financial problems will recur in the \nfuture.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1d: \n Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on May 18, 2007. On \nMarch 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and E \n(Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 2, 2008; answered it on April \n15, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on April 17, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 21, 2008, \nand the case was assigned to me on May 8, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nMay 12, 2008, scheduling the hearing for May 29, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) \nA through I, which were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to \nkeep the record open until June 13, 2008 to enable him to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. Applicant timely submitted AX J through O, and they were \nadmitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX J through O is \nattached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June \n5, 2008. The record closed on June 13, 2008. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 5, a personal subject interview extracted from a \nreport of investigation, without calling an authenticating witness as required by the \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. I explained the authentication requirement to Applicant, and he \nwaived it (Tr. 27-29).  Accordingly, I admitted GX 5.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, \n1.f, and 2.a. At the hearing, he denied the allegation of falsifying his security clearance \napplication alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a (Tr. 16). His admissions in his answer to the SOR and \nat the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old configuration and data management analyst for a \ndefense contractor. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) from July 1996 to July \n2001. He held a clearance while in the USMC, but he does not currently have a \nclearance (Tr. 9).  \n \nApplicant was employed as a radar technician for a private company from July \n2001 to December 2002. He has been self-employed as a digital media developer from \nJanuary 2003 to the present. He began working for his current employer in November \n2005. He had a brief period, from May to July 2007, when he had no income except for \nhis USMC disability pay. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose while he was in college and working part time \n(Tr. 52; GX 5). He attended a community college from May 2003 to December 2004, \nand completed the requirements for a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration at a \nlocal university in May 2007 (AX H). He received certification from the Institute of \nCertified Professional Managers in February 2008 (AX I).

He intends to enroll \n\n \n3 \n \n \nin graduate school in January 2009 to obtain a master\u2019s degree in business \nadministration (Tr. 8). \n \nApplicant purchased a new 2005 Nissan Altima while in school, despite his \nreduced income. The purchase was necessitated when his old 1999 Ford became \ninoperable and required expensive repairs. He was still making payments on the old car \nand could not afford a second car loan. After researching the market and consulting with \nknowledgeable family members, he concluded he could obtain a more favorable loan by \ntrading in his old car and purchasing a new car (Tr. 80-83). His car payments are \ncurrent, and this debt is not among the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager and mentor in the leadership development program \ndescribes him as mature, trustworthy, highly ethical, reliable, responsible, and a strong \nleader (AX G). His roommate and coworker for the past six months considers him \ntrustworthy, responsible, very capable, and highly motivated. He also describes him as \ndevoted to his family and attentive to his financial obligations (AX K). Two of his \nsupervisors wrote letters of recommendation supporting his application for graduate \nschool. One commented that Applicant was \u201cthe most promising individual [he has] \nworked with\u201d in the leadership development program (AX M). The other commented on \nhis maturity, poise, problem-solving skills, and leadership (AX N). \n \n \nThe debt for telephone service alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a arose while Applicant was \non active duty in the USMC. When he was contacted by a collection agency, he did not \nremember the debt because it was so old, and he disputed it. Since the debt was so old \nand for such a small amount, the collection agency decided not to pursue its collection \nefforts any further (Tr. 41; AX A). \n \n \nThe delinquent telephone bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b arose when Applicant moved \nout of an apartment because of roommate problems, but the telephone was not \ndisconnected. Applicant has settled the debt (Tr. 42; AX B; AX L). \n \n \nApplicant was married in February 1998, separated in 2002, and divorced in \nAugust 2005. They had two cars, both in Applicant\u2019s name. When they separated, his \nex-wife agreed to take possession of one car and make the payments. She was unable \nto make the payments and unable to refinance the car in her name. In 2003 Applicant \nand his ex-wife agreed to let the car be repossessed, resulting in the delinquent debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c (Tr. 43-46; AX C). Applicant contacted the creditor shortly after the \nrepossession and was informed he could settle the debt for about $6,000. He was in \nschool, had limited income, and could not afford to pay the entire debt (Tr. 67-68). In \nJanuary 2008, Applicant contacted the creditor and requested that a monthly payment \nplan be established for the debt (GX 4). When he did not receive a response, he called \nthe creditor, who told him that he could make voluntary partial payments if he wished, \nbut they would not establish a formal payment plan (Tr. 63). Applicant had made no \npartial payments as of the date the record closed. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d arose when Applicant leased an apartment after \nhis divorce and shared it with a friend. Applicant moved out before the end of the lease \nand agreed to allow his roommate to continue living in the apartment. The friend \ndamaged the apartment and departed without cleaning it. The debt represents the cost \nof repairs and cleaning. Applicant has negotiated a payment plan for this debt and made \ntwo payments in May 2008, one for $200 and one for $253 (Tr. 46-48); AX E). The \ncollection agency has informed Applicant that it will compromise the amount due and \nsettle the debt for about $1,600, if he continues to make regular payments (Tr. 90).  \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e arose from Applicant\u2019s purchase of a vacuum \ncleaner from a door-to-door salesman while he was still in the USMC (GX 5). He \ntestified he and his then-wife had \u201cbuyer\u2019s regret\u201d immediately after the purchase and \nreturned it, relying on a 30-day money back guarantee. He testified he received a letter \nacknowledging return of the vacuum cleaner, but he no longer has a copy of it (Tr. 91). \nApplicant wrote two letters to the collection agency in May 2008, asking for verification \nof the debt and offering to make arrangements for payment of any outstanding balance \n(AX F). He has received no response to his letters (Tr. 50-52).  \n \n \nIn a personal financial statement executed in February 2008, Applicant reported \na gross monthly salary of $3,923.08, net monthly income (including USMC disability \npay) of $3,684.64, expenses of $2,368.64, debt payments of $905, and a net monthly \nremainder of $411 (GX 4). As of June 1, 2008, his gross monthly salary had increased \nto about $4,300 (AX O). Applicant has not sought credit counseling (Tr. 92). \n \n \nThe evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized \nin the table below. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount \nStatus at Hearing \nEvidence \n1.a \nTelephone \n$75 \nCollection Abandoned \nAX A; Tr. 41 \n1.b \nTelephone \n$288 \nSettled \nAX B; AX L \n1.c \nAuto repossession \n$7,506 \nNot resolved \nAX C; Tr. 63 \n1.d \nDamage to apartment \n$3,237 \nMonthly payments \nAX E;  \nTr. 46-48, 90 \n1.e \nVacuum Cleaner \n$2,054 \nNot resolved; no response \nfrom collection agency \nAX F;  \nTr. 50-52, 91 \n \n \nOn his security clearance application dated May 18, 2007, Applicant answered \n\u201cyes\u201d to question 27d, asking if he had any judgments against him in the last seven \nyears that were unpaid, and he disclosed a small claims court judgment entered against \nhim in May 2001. However, he answered \u201cno\u201d questions 27b, 28a, and 28b concerning \ndelinquent debts. Question 27b asked if he had any property repossessed for any \nreason in the last seven years. Question 28a asked if he had been more than 180 days \ndelinquent on any debt in the last seven years. Question 28b asked if he was currently \nmore than 90 days delinquent on any debt. He did not disclose any of the delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant had obtained a copy of his credit report in the summer of 2006, and he \nwas aware that several collection accounts were listed (GX 5; Tr. 69). In November \n2007, he told a security investigator that his omission of the delinquent debts from his \nsecurity clearance application was an oversight (GX 5). At the hearing, he testified he \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to questions 28a and 28b because he was not delinquent on any current \naccounts, and he did not think the questions applied to collection accounts (Tr. 52-54). \nHe also testified he was taking final exams, working part time, under a lot of stress \nwhen he filled out the application (Tr. 54). On cross-examination he testified it took him \n\u201ca few days\u201d to complete the application (Tr. 71). He admitted he was aware of several \ndelinquent debts when he completed it (Tr. 77). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e). It also alleges Applicant \ndid not subtract payments for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e from the net monthly \nremainder reported on his personal financial statement executed on February 15, 2008 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f). The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f does not allege that the personal financial statement was intentionally \nfalsified. At the time it was executed, the personal financial statement was accurate, \nbecause Applicant was not making payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. I \nresolve this allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@  \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e).  \n \nEven though Applicant purchased a new car in 2005, when he was on a limited \nincome, the purchase was not \u201cfrivolous or irresponsible\u201d under the circumstances. His \nold vehicle was inoperable and required expensive repairs. After researching the market \nand consulting with family and friends, he determined it was more economically prudent \nto purchase a new car with more favorable loan terms. Accordingly, I conclude AG \u00b6 \n19(b) is not raised by this purchase. \n \nThe purchase of a $2,000 vacuum cleaner was arguably \u201cfrivolous,\u201d but Applicant \nand his then-wife quickly recognized their mistake and returned it. Even though \nApplicant no longer has any documentation of the return, I found his testimony on this \npoint plausible and credible. He has tried in good faith to determine if there is any \nremaining balance on the ill-advised purchase. Since Applicant returned the frivolous \npurchase within days and in accordance with the purchase agreement, I conclude AG \u00b6 \n19(b) is not raised by this purchase. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \n \nThe first two prongs (\u201cso long ago\u201d and \u201cso infrequent\u201d) are not established \nbecause Applicant incurred multiple delinquent debts, some of which remain \nunresolved. The third prong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) is established for the auto repossession \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) because that debt resulted from the marital breakup and the consequent \nreduction in Applicant\u2019s income, but it is not established for the other debts. The final \nprong is not established because Applicant has not yet established a track record of \nfinancial responsibility.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e. conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \nApplicant\u2019s separation and eventual divorce, the damage to an apartment by a \nformer roommate, and his brief period without income from May to July 2005 were \nconditions beyond his control. His reduced income while attending college, while not \nimprudent, was a voluntary act on his part. The two delinquent telephone bills arose \nbefore the conditions beyond his control. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable \nto the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \n \nApplicant attempted to verify the debt attributable to the vacuum cleaner \npurchase, and he has negotiated a payment plan for the apartment damage. However, \nhe has made no partial payments on the repossession deficiency alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, \neven though the creditor is willing to accept partial payments and Applicant now has the \napparent ability to make partial payments. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, but not for \u00b6 1.c. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not sought counseling. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicant has resolved the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b and is making the agreed payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. However, \nas of the date the record closed, Applicant had finished school and had been working \nfull time for nearly a year, but he had not made any payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, \neven though the creditor informed him it would accept voluntary partial payments. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d, but not for 1.c. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \ndisputed the debt for the vacuum cleaner in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He asked the collection agency \nto verify whether any balance is due, but has not received a response. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(e) is established for the vacuum cleaner debt. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified his security clearance application by \nanswering \u201cno\u201d to questions 28a and 28b and failing to disclose the delinquent debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e.  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nAt the time Applicant executed his security clearance application, he was a \nmature adult with a college degree in business administration. He had been through the \nsecurity clearance process when he was in the USMC. He demonstrated at the hearing \nthat he was intelligent and articulate. His mental acumen is verified by the glowing \nrecommendations he has received from his supervisors. He had examined his credit \nreport in 2006 and was aware of his delinquent debts. He knew delinquent debts raised \na security concern. I found his explanations for his failure to disclose his delinquent \ndebts implausible and not credible. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised, shifting the burden \nto Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant made no effort to correct his omissions until he was \nconfronted with the facts by a security investigator in November 2007. AG \u00b6 17(a) is not \nestablished. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is so \nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Intentional \nfalsification is a felony under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, and not \u201cminor.\u201d Applicant\u2019s conduct is \nrecent because it occurred during his current application for a clearance. It is not \n\u201cinfrequent\u201d because Applicant has persisted in offering implausible and inconsistent \nexplanations for his failing to disclose his delinquent debts on his security clearance \napplication. It did not happen under \u201cunique circumstances,\u201d but rather as part of a \nroutine security clearance application. Finally, it casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. No other \nenumerated mitigating conditions are established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a talented and highly motivated employee. He served honorably in \nthe USMC, and he has worked hard to continue his education and improve his \nprofessional qualifications. He held a security clearance for many years, apparently \nwithout incident. Even if Applicant had mitigated the security concern based on financial \nconsiderations, his lack of candor on his security clearance application would leave me \nwith doubts about his reliability and trustworthiness. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns based on financial considerations and personal conduct. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December 8,\n2006. On March 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines B\n(Foreign Influence) and Guideline L (Outside Activities) for Applicant. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 14, 2008. He elected to have\nhis case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment\u2019s written case on June 9, 2008. Applicant received a complete file of\nrelevant material (FORM) on June 20, 2008, and was provided an opportunity to file\nOctober 3, 2008\n\nThe Government submitted six items in support of its contentions.\n1\n2\nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.1\nApplicant submitted additional information. The case was assigned to me on September\n10, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel did not submit a formal request that I take administrative\nnotice of certain facts relating to Canada. Documents were included in the record as\nItems (5-6) concerning the Canadian university and research center. The facts\nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated May 14, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-b and 2.a of the SOR. He submitted additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nApplicant is a 67-year-old computer science professor employed at a research\ninstitution in Canada. He is also a consultant for a defense contractor. He was born and\nraised in the United States. He received his undergraduate degree and a PhD from a\nuniversity in the U.S. in 1983. He submitted a security clearance application on\nDecember 8, 2006. He has been granted a secret security clearance several times in\nhis career (Item 4).\nApplicant served in many academic positions in the U.S. as a professor and\nresearch consultant during his long career. He served as an expert witness for various\nresearch projects (Item 3). He has lectured abroad for many years.\nApplicant is married with two adult children. He sold his home in the U.S. in 2005,\nbut still has substantial financial holdings in the U.S., including property. The home that\nhe owns in Canada is a small portion of his net worth (estimated value of the Canadian\nresidence is $464,000). \nApplicant moved to Canada in 2005 for employment. He accepted a\nprofessorship in a research institution that is partially funded by the government of\nCanada. Additionally, he holds the Chair for Research in Privacy and Security at the\nuniversity (Item 5). This position is sponsored and funded by the government of\nCanada. Applicant\u2019s salary and the funding for his research project is provided by the\ngovernment of Canada to a great degree. The research program was developed by the\ngovernment of Canada to develop a national strategy to make \u201cCanada one of the\nworld\u2019s top countries for research development\u201d (Item 5). The research lab received\n$815,000 in a research award from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). \n\n3\nApplicant discussed this professorship in Canada within the Department of\nDefense (DoD) community before accepting the position. He learned that U.S. and\nCanadian security clearances are generally considered interchangeable in joint\nCanadian-U.S. commands. He met with joint U.S. and Canadian commands. He was\nunaware of any conflict of interest with such an appointment.\nHe has continued his service work with National Academies in the U.S. and has\nworked with DoD as a workshop leader for training of security analysts who work with\nDoD network data. He is in the process of negotiating a cooperative research and\ndevelopment agreement for access to that data. He serves in an advisory capacity to\nthe U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). He recently obtained research\nfunding from DHS for a new project (Response to FORM, dated September 2008).\nApplicant\u2019s salary is paid by the Canadian government through the University. He\nreceives research funding from the Canadian government and private industry.\nWhen Applicant learned about the investigation of his security clearance and the\ngovernment\u2019s concern about a potential conflict of interest, he decided to leave the\nCanadian university as soon as reasonable. He could not leave immediately due to a\nresearch contract. He also has an age discrimination suit against the university. He\nsearched for and obtained an offer for a professorship in a university in the U.S.\nApplicant has accepted a position beginning in January 2009. He is taking a leave of\nabsence in January 2009 from the Canadian university and resignation will be effective\nin June 2009. \nApplicant has his home in Canada on the market for sale. He will sell the house\nas soon as possible. He and his wife have recently purchased a house near property\nthat they own in the U.S. They plan to move their possessions to this house during the\nfall of 2008 or early winter 2009.\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Canada is an ally of the U.S.\nCanada and the U.S. share a lengthy border, that is remarkable for its peaceful history\nfor well over 150 years. Canada and the U.S. have a long history of collaboration on\nmatters related to the security of both nations. They share computer science research at\nboth classified and unclassified levels.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n4\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:      \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\n\n5\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associates with a\nrisk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 7(b), a Aconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information,\u201d may create a security concern. Similarly\nunder AG & 7(e) \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign\ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the\nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d may raise security\nconcerns. Applicant is a professor and researcher in an institution funded by the\ngovernment of Canada. He has lived in Canada since 2005 and owns a home there. He\nreceives a salary and funding for his research from the Canadian government in part.\nThe evidence is sufficient to establish these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring\na closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from foreign influence. Under AG \u00b6 8(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d Applicant\u2019s work has been\npartially funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. He is working on a\nproject that is in collaboration with the U.S. Applicant has been an academic and\nresearch professor in the U.S. for many years. He has held a security clearance during\nhis long career. He is returning to the U.S. to resume his work. The evidence supports\napplication of this mitigating condition. \nUnder AG & 8(b), it may be mitigating where Athere is no conflict of interest,\neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d As noted above, Applicant\nhas longstanding, academic ties with the U.S. Any loyalty to Canada is outweighed by\nhis loyalty to the U.S. I am confident that any conflict that arise will be resolved in favor\nof the U.S. I find this potentially mitigating condition applies in this case. \n\n6\nGuideline L, Outside Activities\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Outside Activities is set out in\nAG \u00b6 36:\nInvolvement in certain types of outside employment or activities is of\nsecurity concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual\u2019s\nsecurity responsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized\ndisclosure of classified information.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 37(a) \nany employment or service, whether compensated or volunteer, with:\n(1) the government of a foreign country;\n(2) any foreign national, organization, or other entity;\n(3) a representative of any foreign interest;\n(4) any foreign, domestic, or international organization or person engaged\nin analysis, discussion, or publication of material on intelligence, defense,\nforeign affairs, or protected technology.\nUnder AG \u00b6 37(b) \u201cfailure to report or fully disclose an outside activity that is\nrequired.\u201d\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from outside activities. Under AG \u00b6 38(a), the disqualifying conditions\nmay be mitigated where \u201cevaluation of the outside employment by the appropriate\nsecurity or counterintelligence office indicates that it does not pose a conflict with an\nindividual\u2019s security responsibilities or with the national security interests of the United\nStates.\u201d This mitigating condition does not apply because no such evaluation has been\nincluded in the record evidence. If such an evaluation occurs, Applicant could be eligible\nfor a clearance.\nUnder AG \u00b6 38(b), the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nindividual terminated the employment or discontinued the activity upon being notified\nthat it was in conflict with his or her security responsibilities.\u201d\nGiven the mitigation of the foreign influence guideline, this disqualifying condition\nappears partially redundant. However, once Applicant returns to the U.S. and ends his\nCanadian employment, he will be eligible to hold a clearance.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\n\n7\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born and raised in the\nU.S. He received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from a university in the U.S.\nApplicant worked many years in the academic field. He was a research consultant and\nheld a security clearance over a long period of time. Applicant accepted a position in\n2005 in Canada and had his salary funded in part by the Canadian Government.  He is\nnow returning to the U.S. and will continue research projects for the U.S. government.\nHe has property in the U.S. and will live in the U.S. with his wife. \nProvided Applicant moves to the U.S. and ends his receipt of funds from the\nCanadian government as planned, I see no reason why his clearance would not be\napproved in 2009. I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that it is not clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nIn reaching my decision, I considered the evidence as a whole, including the\nappropriate factors and guidelines. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence, but not\noutside activities.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline L:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She seeks a security clearance for her duties. Applicant was born in Brazil in December 1982 to a father with native Brazilian and derivative United Kingdom (UK) citizenship and a mother with native Irish citizenship.

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has not mitigated the foreign preference concerns that exist because of\nher possession and/or use of two foreign passports after she became a United States\ncitizen. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on June 25, 2007. On March 27, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline C that provided the basis for its action to deny her a\nsecurity clearance and to refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nIn setting forth the procedural history of the case, Department Counsel correctly noted that Applicant admitted\n1\nthe two allegations when she answered the SOR. However, in her argument, Department Counsel indicated\nthat Applicant admitted all SOR allegations except for \u00b6 1.c. There is no \u00b6 1.c in the SOR of record.\nOn her e-QIP (Item 4), she indicated her brother entered the US on July 17, 1997. She also listed US\n2\naddresses for herself from September 1997 on.\nSince Ireland\u2019s admission into the EU, Irish citizens are apparently issued EU passports (Item 5).\n3\n2\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 18, 2008, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. On April 28, 2008, the government submitted a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) consisting of five exhibits (Items 1-5). DOHA forwarded a\ncopy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed her to respond within 30 days of receipt.\nApplicant filed no response. On July 7, 2008, the case was assigned to me to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline C that Applicant possesses valid Brazilian (SOR\n\u00b6 1.a) and Irish (SOR \u00b6 1.b) passports. Applicant admitted the allegations in her answer\nto the SOR.  After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings\n1\nof fact:\nApplicant is a 25-year-old human resources analyst who has worked for a\ndefense contractor since June 2007. She seeks a security clearance for her duties.\nApplicant was born in Brazil in December 1982 to a father with native Brazilian\nand derivative United Kingdom (UK) citizenship and a mother with native Irish\ncitizenship. Her father acquired UK citizenship through his parents, who were British\nnationals. Applicant and her brother, who was born in Brazil in March 1981, acquired\nBrazilian citizenship based on birth and Irish citizenship through their mother. (Items 4,\n5)\nApplicant immigrated to the United States (US) in 1997 when she was a minor,2\nand she attended high school here from August 1999 to May 2001. She continued to\nmaintain Brazilian and Irish/European Union (EU) passports  and used the respective\n3\npassports when traveling to Brazil and to Ireland to visit family members. In August\n2000, Applicant was issued an Irish/EU passport based on her Irish citizenship. The\npassport is scheduled to expire in August 2010. (Items 4, 5)\n\nApparently, she reentered the US on her EU passport as it bears a US immigration stamp showing she was\n4\nadmitted to the US on January 6, 2001 (Item 5). The file available for review does not include any Brazilian\npassports issued to her before her most recent passport, which she obtained after the trip in 2000/01.\nApplicant listed on her e-QIP a trip to Ireland in December 2003 (Item 4). Her EU passport does not bear any\n5\nvisa stamps for 2003, but it does contain a stamp from US immigration showing she was admitted to the US\non December 29, 2002. It is likely the trip was in December 2002 rather than 2003.\n3\nApplicant traveled to Brazil with her parents and brother for pleasure from\nDecember 2000 to January 2001.  They visited members of her father\u2019s family and\n4\nengaged in tourist activities. In July 2001, the summer after high school, she went to\nIreland by herself. She traveled on her Irish/EU passport, which bears a US reentry\nstamp of August 5, 2001. While in Ireland, she visited with members of her mother\u2019s\nfamily. (Items 4, 5)\nFrom August 2001 to May 2005, Applicant pursued her undergraduate degree in\npsychology at a state university. In December 2002, she traveled to Ireland with her\nparents for a couple of weeks to see members of her mother\u2019s family.  (Items 4, 5)\n5\nApplicant became a naturalized US citizen in January 2005. She made no effort\nat that time to renounce either her Brazilian or Irish citizenship. There is no indication\nthat she applied for a US passport after becoming a US citizen. Two weeks before she\nbecame a US citizen, she renewed her Brazilian passport for another five years. The\npassport is not scheduled to expire until January 2010. Applicant traveled to Brazil on\nthat passport in December 2005. She accompanied her parents, her brother, and her\nboyfriend. During their three-week stay, they visited with her grandmother and an aunt,\nand went to several beach towns. (Items 4, 5)\nFrom August 2005 to May 2007, Applicant pursued graduate study full-time in\nindustrial psychology at a public university located in another state. After she earned her\nM.A. degree, Applicant began working for her present employer in June 2007. On June\n25, 2007, she completed her e-QIP. She disclosed her multiple citizenships with the US,\nBrazil, and Ireland, her possession of current foreign passports with Brazil and Ireland,\nand her foreign travels to Brazil and Ireland since December 2000. Applicant indicated\nthat her parents had been naturalized in the US in June 2004, but that they retained\ntheir foreign citizenships, her father with the UK and his native Brazil, and her mother\nwith her native Ireland. Applicant provided the alien registration information for her\nbrother, who had not acquired US citizenship. Applicant furnished address and\ncitizenship information for several relatives living in Brazil or Ireland. (Item 4)\nOn August 6, 2007, a government investigator interviewed Applicant about her\nforeign citizenship, passports, travel, and contacts. The substance of the interview was\nreduced to writing in the form of a report from the investigator. Applicant reportedly\nexplained in part that she had derivative Irish citizenship through her mother, that she\nheld a current Irish passport used to travel to Ireland, that she otherwise derived no\nbenefit from her Irish citizenship, that she was a citizen of Brazil from her birth to\npresent because her father was born there, that she used her Brazilian passport to\n\n4\ntravel there in 2000/01, that she otherwise derived no benefit from her Brazilian\ncitizenship, and that she was willing to renounce her foreign citizenship and passports, if\nrequired to do so, because the US held her ultimate loyalty. (Item 5)\nDOHA sent interrogatories to Applicant inquiring about her possession and use\nof her foreign passports, about any foreign military service, any receipt of benefits from\na foreign country, any foreign political activity, any foreign financial interests, and any\nforeign obligations or responsibilities. Applicant was also asked to respond to foreign\ninfluence inquiries, including contacts with foreign nationals and any foreign travel within\nthe past two years. Applicant was sent a copy of the investigator\u2019s report of her August\n2007 interview,  and she was asked to verify the information therein.\nApplicant responded on March 14, 2008. She furnished copies of her current\nBrazilian passport issued on January 4, 2005, and of her current Irish/EU passport\nissued on August 7, 2000. She reported no recent travel to Brazil or Ireland after she\nhad completed her e-QIP. Applicant responded \u201cYes\u201d to whether she intended to renew\nthe foreign passports and \u201cNo\u201d to whether she would be willing to destroy, surrender, or\ninvalidate the foreign passports. She stated her belief that her possession of the\nBrazilian and Irish passports did not pose a threat to national security because her\ntravel was to visit family members only. Applicant asserted her loyalty was to the US.\nApplicant indicated that the investigator\u2019s report of her interview was inaccurate in\nseveral aspects, including that it reflected travel to Ireland on her Irish passport in 2001\nand 2003 rather than 2001 and 2002 and that her Brazilian citizenship was derivative\nbased on her father\u2019s birth rather than on her own birth in Brazil. Applicant denied she\nhad expressed a willingness to give up her foreign citizenship and passports. Instead,\nApplicant recollected she had told the investigator she was willing to consider\nrenouncing her foreign citizenship and passports. (Item 5)\nAs of April 18, 2008, Applicant possessed Brazilian and Irish/EU passports valid\nfor foreign travel (see Item 3). There is no indication that she had made any effort to\nsurrender them.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\n\n5\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the United States. (AG \u00b6 9). Applicant had dual\ncitizenship with Ireland and Brazil when she immigrated to the US in or before 1997.\nAbout two weeks before she took the oath of naturalization to become a US citizen in\nJanuary 2005, she renewed her Brazilian passport for another five years. She traveled\non that foreign passport to visit family members in Brazil in December 2005. There is no\nindication that she used her Irish/EU passport after she became a US citizen, but her\ncontinued possession of that current foreign passport also raises foreign preference\nconcerns. AG \u00b6 10(a) (\u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This\n\n6\nincludes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport\u201d) is clearly\nimplicated.\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s Brazilian citizenship is based on her birth in that country,\nand her Irish citizenship is based on her mother\u2019s citizenship, AG \u00b6 11(a) (\u201cdual\ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country\u201d) does not\nmitigate the risk of unverifiable travel presented by use of a foreign passport. A\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship is potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 11(b). While\nApplicant told a government investigator in August 2007 that she would consider\nrenouncing her Brazilian and Irish citizenships if required, she told DOHA in March 2008\nthat she intends to renew her foreign passports, so AG \u00b6 11(b) does not apply. There is\nno indication that her use of a foreign passport as a US citizen was approved by the\ncognizant security authority, so AG \u00b6 11(d) cannot be considered. She does not see a\nproblem with her possession and/or use of her Brazilian and Irish/EU passports\nbecause she intends to use them only to visit family members. A substantial risk\npersists that she will use a foreign passport so that she can visit her relatives in Brazil\nand/or Ireland.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nDespite her clear desire to retain her foreign citizenships and her foreign\npassports, Applicant asserts an ultimate loyalty to the US where she has lived for at\nleast the last 11 years. The salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in\nterms of loyalty, but rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See\nExecutive Order 10865, Section 7. She traveled abroad at least once after she acquired\nher US citizenship, to Brazil in December 2005 using a foreign passport.  Having been\nadvised that her active exercise of foreign citizenship is of concern to the US\ngovernment, Applicant has chosen to retain the right/privilege to travel as a citizen of\n\nSection 1185(b) of the US Immigration and Nationality Act ( 8 USC \u00a7 1185(b)) provides:\n6\nExcept as otherwise provided by the President and subject to such limitations and exceptions\nas the President may authorize and prescribe, it shall be unlawful for any citizen of the United\nStates to depart from or enter, or attempt to depart from or enter, the United States unless\nhe bears a valid United States passport.\nExceptions for travel in the W estern Hemisphere,  between the US and Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, and the\nCaribbean, do not apply to travel to Brazil.  \n7\nBrazil at times, and as a citizen of Ireland at others. Although the US maintains good\nrelations with Ireland and Brazil, their interests are not always completely aligned. There\nis no indication that she had acquired a US passport as of her June 2007 e-QIP, even\nthough US citizens, including dual nationals, are required by law to use a US passport\nto enter and leave the US.  Doubts persist about whether she can be counted on to act\n6\nsolely with regard to what is in the best interest of the US.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The government alleged Applicant owed approximately $36,109 for 16 delinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.p. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted owing these debts and asserted they would be included in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition he intended to file.

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn June 20, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for his job with\na defense contractor, for whom he has worked since May 2006. (Gx. 1) After reviewing\nthe results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant access to\nclassified information. On April 17, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the Revised\nNovember 24, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline F\n2\n(financial).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on July 9, 2008, and I convened a hearing on September 4, 2008. The\nparties appeared as scheduled. The government presented five exhibits (Gx. 1 - 7).\nApplicant testified in his own behalf, submitted one exhibit (Ax. A) and presented one\nwitness. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 18, 2008. I left the record\nopen after the hearing to allow Applicant time to present additional relevant information.\n(Tr. 72) The record closed on September 29, 2008, when I received three additional\ndocuments from Applicant, which have been collectively admitted without objection as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (Ax.) B.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged Applicant owed approximately $36,109 for 16 delinquent\ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.p. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted owing\nthese debts and asserted they would be included in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition he\nintended to file. The government also alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified his\nanswers to e-QIP questions 28.a (debts more than 180 days past due in the last seven\nyears) (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and 23.d (any alcohol- or drug-related offenses ever) (SOR \u00b6 2.b).\nApplicant is 45 years old. He has been married twice. Most recently, he was\nmarried in 1998 but divorced in 2003. The marriage fell apart when the company he\nworked for moved in 2002, leaving him unemployed for almost a year. Attempts at\nreconciliation ended because of the effects on both him and his ex-wife from the\naccidental death of her son. Applicant moved away and neither he nor his ex-wife\ncontinued paying their bills. (Tr. 30 - 31, 55) The marital residence went into foreclosure,\nApplicant returned a car for repossession (SOR \u00b6 1.I for $11,164), and a number of\ncredit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d, totaling $22,643) went unpaid. Utility bills left\nover from the marital residence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, 1.j, 1.n, 1.o and 1.p, totaling $978)\nsome of which are less than $100, have gone unpaid since about 2003. Finally,\nApplicant is delinquent on three medical accounts totaling $639 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k - 1.m).\n(Gx. 2; Gx. 4)\nWhen Applicant left his marital residence, he was unemployed. He eventually\nmoved back to his hometown where he currently lives and works. He struggled to find\nemployment, but now has a steady job. His current job required extensive travel for the\nfirst 10 months. He was able to save much of the per diem he received and used it to\nbuy a boat in 2007. (Tr. 58 - 59) He lives well within his means, pays his current\nobligations on time,  and has about $1,100 remaining after expenses each month;\nhowever, this number does not reflect any payments to creditors. (Gx. 2; Tr. 37, 55 - 58)\nWhen he received interrogatories from DOHA adjudicators in February 2008 (Gx. 2),\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n3\n3\nApplicant retained a bankruptcy attorney. (Ax. A) He has paid the retainer and appears\nto have funds for the filing fee, but has not yet provided his attorney with all of the\ninformation needed to actually file a petition. (Ax. A; Tr. 34 - 35)\nWhen Applicant filled out his e-QIP, he answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 28.a (In the\nlast 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?) The only debt he\nlisted was for a truck repossession during his divorce. Applicant knew his finances and\ncredit rating were in trouble but insists he did not know he owed as much debt as the\ngovernment\u2019s information shows. He first became aware of the true extent of his debt in\nSeptember 2007, when he was interviewed by a government investigator during his\nbackground check. (Tr. 37 - 38)\nApplicant was arrested in 1988, 1991 and 2000 for driving under the influence of\nalcohol (DUI). His 1988 arrest also included a charge of misdemeanor possession of\nmarijuana. He was convicted of the charges each time. (Gx. 5) When he filled out his e-\nQIP, he answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 23.d (Have you ever been charged with or\nconvicted of any offense(s) related to drugs or alcohol?) He disclosed a March 1996\nDUI, by which he was probably referring to his 1991 arrest. (Tr. 41 - 42) Applicant\nexplained he either did not understand the question or that he was advised by someone\nat work that he only had to go back 10 years. (Tr. 32 - 33, 39 - 40) However, his\nreference to a 10-year time frame makes no sense in light of his disclosure of a 1996\n(actually 1991) arrest. He did not disclose his DUI offense in 2000. (Tr. 42 - 44)\nApplicant has a good reputation at work. His most recent performance evaluation\nreflects above-average performance and his supervisor characterizes him as reliable\nand hardworking. (Ax. B) A long-time friend testified that Applicant is sincere and\ntrustworthy. The witness also corroborated Applicant\u2019s claim that he struggled to get\nback on his feet after his most recent divorce, but that he is now doing better financially.\n(Tr. 59 - 64)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n3\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n5\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n6\n4\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) and AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - financial\nconsiderations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n5\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.6\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\n\n5\nThe government presented sufficient information to support all of the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6 1. Available information also shows Applicant has not paid or resolved any of\nthe debts listed therein. Those debts have been delinquent for about five years. The\nrecord in this case requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6\n19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations).\nIn response, Applicant presented information about his loss of employment, his\ndivorce and his stepson\u2019s untimely passing as the circumstances that led to his financial\nproblems. This information requires consideration of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6\n20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances). He also presented information showing he has taken steps to\nresolve his indebtedness by retaining a bankruptcy attorney who will help him repay the\ndebts through a Chapter 13 wage earners\u2019 plan. Additionally, his current finances show\nhe is living within his means and should be able to comply with Chapter 13 payments. \nPersonal and professional events, such as Applicant has experienced, can have\na significant impact on one\u2019s ability to manage personal finances. However, it is not\nunreasonable to expect that Applicant would be more responsive five years later when\nfaced with such problems. It may be that Applicant was not fully aware of the depth of\nhis indebtedness before he was interviewed by an investigator in September 2007. He\nhas chosen bankruptcy as a way to resolve his debts. While this option may be an\nacceptable means of resolving one\u2019s debts, Applicant waited until March 2008 to hire a\nbankruptcy attorney. As of the date of his hearing, he had not yet given the attorney all\nof the information needed to file a petition. Despite the relative health of his current\nmonthly budget (which enabled him to buy a boat last year), Applicant has not satisfied\nthe AG \u00b6 20(b) requirement that he has \u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s debts are significant, and must be considered as recent and ongoing\nin light of the absence of action to resolve them. In summary, there is no basis in the\nrecord to support application of any of the mitigating conditions under this guideline.\nAccordingly, Applicant has failed to present sufficient information that would mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised by the adverse information about his finances.\nPersonal Conduct. \nA security concern may also exist when, as stated in AG \u00b6 15, available\ninformation reflects\n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\n\n6\nThe government alleged that Applicant deliberately omitted information about his\nfinances and his arrest record when he answered e-QIP questions 28.a and 23.d,\nrespectively. The government\u2019s information shows Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to both\nquestions, but that he listed only one of his 16 debts and one of his four drug- or\nalcohol-related criminal offenses. Applicant denied intentionally falsifying his answers.\nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.a, he claimed he was not aware of the full extent of his finances\nand listed a repossession debts associated with his divorce. However, he also\nacknowledged that he and his wife had \u201cwalked away\u201d from their finances when the\nmarriage ended. Based on that knowledge, he should have been able to at least\ndisclose the possibility of other debts. As to SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant claimed he was told\nhe only had to list arrests within the preceding 10 years; however, what he actually\nlisted was more than 10 years old and he failed to list his only arrest within the past 10\nyears. \nBecause Applicant denied this allegation, the government bore the burden of\n\u201cpresenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts that have been\ncontroverted.\u201d (Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.14) To be disqualifying, it must be\nshown Applicant knowingly providing false information about relevant information in his\nbackground. Applicant\u2019s e-QIP answers to both questions, viewed together and in light\nof all of the information bearing on his finances and arrest record, show he did intend to\nminimize the full extent of the adverse information about these issues in his\nbackground. Accordingly, available information requires application of the disqualifying\ncondition at AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities;).\nIn response to the government\u2019s information, Applicant provided conflicting\ntestimony about his intent at the time he completed the e-QIP. He acknowledged\nawareness of financial problems but did not explain why he did not disclose other debts\nhe may have been aware of. His explanation about his answer to the question about\ndrug-/alcohol-related offenses did not make sense and lacked credibility. Available\ninformation does not support application of any of the Guideline E mitigating conditions.\nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of disproving, mitigating, or\nextenuating the adverse information about his personal conduct. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 45 years old and\npresumed to be a mature adult. He has experienced personal and professional\ndifficulties that caused him financial problems. He is credited for taking some steps to\nresolve his debts, but he generally has not acted responsibly in the face of his financial\nproblems since obtaining steady employment two years ago. He has not shown that his\ndebts will be resolved so that he can avoid being at risk of acting inappropriately to raise\n\n See footnote 3, supra.\n7\n See footnote 6, supra. \n8\n7\nneeded funds. He has also demonstrated a willingness to hedge the truth to further his\nown interests (in this case, to get a clearance needed for his job). These facts together\nundermine my confidence in his willingness or ability to protect the government\u2019s\ninterests as his own. The facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s finances and personal\nconduct present an unacceptable risk to the national interest were he top be given\naccess to classified information. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available\n7\ninformation shows there are still doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the\ngovernment\u2019s interests as his own. Because protection of the national interest is\nparamount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the\ngovernment.8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n Subparagraph 1.a - 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Thomas M. Abbott, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), on February 15, 2007. On April 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn April 24, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 20, \n2008. The case was assigned to me on May 27, 2008. On June 5, 2008, a Notice of \nHearing was issued scheduling the hearing for June 25, 2008. The hearing was held as \nscheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 - 2, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Government requested that administrative notice be \ntaken of one document with 12 attachments. The document was marked as \nJuly 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nAdministrative Notice Document I (Admin Not I) without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted 17 exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - Q without \nobjection.  DOHA received the transcript of hearing on July 3, 2008. Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nIran is a theocratic Islamic republic. The United States has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since April 7, 1980. The U.S. Department of State has set forth \nconcerns of the United States with Iran\u2019s policies as: (1) Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear \nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction; (2) Iran\u2019s support for and involvement \nin international terrorism; (3) Iran\u2019s support for violent opposition to the Middle East \npeace process; and (4) Iran\u2019s dismal human rights record. (Admin Not 1, Doc 1 at 9) \nThe United States has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. (Admin Not 1, \nDoc 6 at 2.)  The government of Iran\u2019s human rights abuses against the Iranian people \ninclude summary executions, lack of fair public trials, disappearances, torture, arbitrary \narrest and detention, political prisoners and detainees, severe restrictions on freedom of \nreligion, discrimination against women, and severe restrictions on civil liberties including \nspeech, press, assembly, association, movement and privacy. (Admin Not 1, Doc 5 at 1; \nDoc 4 at 8.)  \n \n The U.S. State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens and U.S.\u2013Iranian \ndual citizens to consider carefully the risks of travel to Iran. Some elements of the \nIranian regime remain hostile to the U.S. and U.S. citizens. U.S.-Iranian dual citizens \nmay be subject to harassment or arrest while residing in Iran. (Admin Not 1, Doc 3.) \nIranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens, and the children of such persons, are considered \nsolely Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. (Admin Not 1, Doc 2 at 1.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 14, 2008, Applicant admitted to all the \nSOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old senior electronic engineer employed with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor. He has worked for the same employer since 1975. \nThe company has changed names several times due to mergers and buyouts. He has a \nbachelor of science degree in electronic engineering. He has held a security clearance \nsince 1975 with no security incidents.  He is divorced and has four adult sons. (Tr at 13-\n18, 20-22; Gov 1.)   \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Iran. He attended elementary and high school \nin Iran. His senior year he attended a boarding school in Tehran. He applied to attend \nthe University of Tehran but was not accepted. In 1963, at the age of 18, Applicant \nimmigrated to the U.S. He attended high school and night school in order to learn \n\n \n3 \n \n \nEnglish. He worked various jobs and attended college, eventually earning his college \ndegree. (Tr at 13-15.) \n \nApplicant met and married his first wife in the U.S. She is an American citizen, \nborn and raised in the U.S.  Two sons were born of the marriage. They are now 39 and \n40. The marriage ended in divorce. In September 1982, Applicant remarried. His \nsecond wife is an American citizen, born and raised in the U.S.  Two sons were born of \nthe marriage. They are now 24 and 22.  His second marriage ended in divorce in \nOctober 2003. (Tr at 20-23; Gov 1, sections 13/15, 14/15; AE P.)  All of Applicant\u2019s sons \nwere born and raised in the U.S.  They have never traveled to Iran. None of his son\u2019s \nspeak Farsi. His two older sons live in another state and operate their own businesses.  \nHis oldest son has two children, ages five and three. His second youngest son serves \non active duty in the U.S. Navy. His youngest son resides with Applicant and is a \ncollege student. (Tr at 23-25.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a U.S. citizen and resides in another state. He is a medical \ndoctor. Applicant and his brother speak over the telephone about once a month. He last \nsaw his brother four years ago when his brother attended a conference nearby the city  \nwhere Applicant resides. (Tr at 28, 50, 55.)  \n \nHis mother is 90-years-old and lives in the same city in Iran where Applicant \ngrew up. His mother is a housewife. Applicant\u2019s father was a doctor. He passed away in \nthe 1970s. His mother is a housewife. His sister is 58-years-old and resides in Iran. She \ntakes care of his mother. She was an urban planner but Applicant is not sure what she \ndoes now. She used to be married but he is not sure of the status of her marriage.  He \nno longer speaks to his mother on the telephone because she has difficulty hearing. \nThe last time he spoke to his mother was about a year and half ago. He talks to his \nsister about two to three times a year to see how things are doing.  Her son is an Iranian \ncitizen currently attending college in a European country. Applicant is not sure what his \nnephew intends to do after graduation but is pretty sure that his nephew does not want \nto return to Iran. He used to talk on the telephone with his nephew about once a month. \nHe now talks to his nephew about four times a year. His nephew calls him. None of his \nfamily members know what Applicant does for a living. (Tr at 25-33, 50; Gov 2 at 19, \n29.)     \n \nSince moving to the U.S. in 1963, Applicant has not traveled back to Iran. He did \nnot attend his father\u2019s funeral when he passed away in the 1970s because he did not \nthink it was safe. He has no intention of traveling to Iran. His mother came to the U.S. to \nvisit Applicant and his brother in the 1970s, and once again in 1985. His sister traveled \nto the U.S. with his mother in the 1970s. The last time Applicant physically saw his \nmother was in 1985. He has never traveled outside the U.S. after moving to the U.S. He \ndoes not send money to his mother, sister, or nephew. He does not intend to travel to \nIran when his mother dies. He has no contact with any other Iranian citizens. He does \nnot have Iranian friends. (Tr at 25-34.)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nOn March 30, 1973, Applicant became a U.S. citizen. He states that the U.S. is a \nland of opportunity.  If you work hard and go the school, you can improve your situation \nin life. Applicant started out mowing lawns on weekends for $2 and now earns \n$100,000/year. (Tr at 34-35; AE I; AE M.) Applicant does not own any property in Iran \nand has no assets in Iran. Applicant owns his home in the U.S. All of his investment and \nretirement benefits are located in the U.S. (Tr at 36-37; AE K; AE L.) \n \nIn 2005, at the suggestion of his brother, Applicant obtained an Iranian passport. \nHe obtained the passport in order to obtain a power of attorney for his sister to give her \ncontrol over his mother\u2019s possessions should something happen to his mother. He had \nto have a valid Iranian passport in order to obtain a power of attorney that was valid in \nIran. His brother did this as well. Applicant never used his Iranian passport for travel. He \nsurrendered his Iranian passport to his security official, who destroyed it. He does not \nintend to apply for another Iranian passport. (Tr at 42-45, 51; Gov 1, section 7; Gov 2 at \n2-4, 27-28, 33-54; AE O.)     \n \nApplicant\u2019s superiors, peers and subordinates all give Applicant stellar reviews of \nhis work performance. (AE A-G.) They include a senior manager at Applicant\u2019s \ncompany who has known Applicant professionally for over 20 years. He states Applicant \nhas unique technical abilities. Applicant\u2019s ability to work with others on a very diverse \nteam has always impressed him. Applicant is a great mentor to younger, junior \nemployees. He diligently follows company rules. (AE A.) The Security Manager at \nApplicant\u2019s company states she has known and worked with Applicant for over 30 \nyears. She sees him on a weekly basis. She is not aware of any security violations by \nApplicant. She finds him trustworthy. (AE D.) The Vice President of Operations has \nknown Applicant for 25 years. They started out in the same department when they \nbegan their careers. At present, Applicant works in the department that he leads. He \nstates Applicant is an integral part of the organization\u2019s success. Applicant is a person \nof high integrity. In the past 25 years, he has not seen anything in Applicant\u2019s character, \nwork ethic, or behavior that would cause him to question Applicant\u2019s qualification to \nretain his clearance. (AE G.) All of the individuals who submitted references on \nApplicant\u2019s behalf were aware of the security issues raised in the SOR.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for 2005, 2006, and 2007 indicate that he \nmeets or exceeds requirements. (AE H.) His work ethic has been recognized through \nnumerous awards and decorations throughout this career. (AE N.) Applicant\u2019s son who \nserves on active duty in the U.S. Navy wrote a letter on his father\u2019s behalf.  He currently \nserves on an aircraft carrier. He states that his father\u2019s love for America is one of the \nreasons why he enlisted in the Navy. His father is very proud that his son is serving in \nthe U.S. Navy. Applicant is a great father who loves his family. He states that his father \nis always working and loves his work. He takes pride in being a mentor to the younger \nemployees at work. (AE Q.)  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) \u00b6 7(c) (contact with a family \nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies because \nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister are citizens of and reside in Iran, a country that is clearly \nhostile to the U.S. An additional concern is raised because Applicant\u2019s nephew is a \ncitizen of Iran, residing in Europe. FI DC \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group or country by providing that information) may also \nraise security concerns. The Iranian government has committed serious human rights \nabuses against it people. Applicant\u2019s immediate family in Iran creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement manipulation, pressure, or coercion. It also a creates \na potential conflict of interest.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Foreign Influence. I find the following Foreign Influence Mitigating \nConditions (FI MC) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nForeign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the \nrelationship with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the \nposition or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the \nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) \nFamily contacts and ties with persons in a foreign country are not automatically \ndisqualifying but require the applicant to present evidence in mitigation and extenuation \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthat he qualifies for a security clearance. Iran\u2019s hostile relationship with the United \nStates and the country\u2019s poor human rights record place \u201ca heavy burden of persuasion \non applicant to show his family members do not pose a security risk. (See, ISCR Case \nNo. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug 4, 2006).  Applicant has met that burden. While \nApplicant has family ties in Iran, the people he is closest to, his four sons and two \ngrandchildren, are citizens of and reside in the U.S.  While Applicant has contact with \nhis family members overseas, he does not travel to Iran to visit them. He does not call \nthem on a regular basis. He has never sent them money.  It is unlikely that Applicant will \nbe placed in a position to choose between his family members and the interests of the \nU.S.       \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest) applies.  While Applicant\u2019s mother and sister reside in Iran, he has \nlived in the U.S for most of his life. Applicant has lived in the U.S. since 1963 after \nmoving here as an 18-year-old. He attended college in the U.S. He has been a U.S. \ncitizen for 35 years. He has possessed a security clearance and worked in the defense \nindustry for over 33 years. He has not traveled back to Iran since he immigrated to the \nUnited States 45 years ago. In fact, he has never traveled outside the U.S. He has not \nseen his mother since 1985. He did not travel to Iran to attend his father\u2019s funeral. He \nhas no intention of returning to Iran. All of his assets are in the U.S. The people he \ncares most about, his four sons, were born and raised in the U.S.  His sons have never \ntraveled to Iran. Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S. indicate Applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nU.S. interests. FI MC \u00b6 8(b) applies.  \n    \nApplicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. \noutweigh any potential for conflict because of Applicant\u2019s relationship to his mother and \nsister who reside in Iran or his nephew, a citizen of Iran residing in Europe.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \n\n \n8 \n \n \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to Iran, a country that is hostile to the U.S., and the heavy burden \nan applicant carries when he has family members in a hostile country. I considered that \nApplicant is a highly regarded engineer who has lived in the U.S. for over 45 of his 62 \nyears. He became a U.S. citizen in 1973. He has never returned to Iran since moving to \nthe U.S., even when his father passed away in the 1970s. Both of his wives were U.S. \ncitizens. His children were born and raised in the U.S.  They have never been to Iran. \nAll of his children reside in the U.S.  All of his assets are located in the U.S. His mother \nhas visited him only twice during the 45 years he has lived in the U.S. He has not seen \nhis mother in 23 years. He has worked with the defense industry since 1975. Over this \n33 year period, he held a security clearance with no security violations. His superiors, \npeers and co-workers comment favorably about his integrity, character, and work ethic. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s family members living in Iran raise a potential security threat due to \nthe very nature of familial relationships, Applicant\u2019s significant ties to the U.S. mitigate \nthe security threat. His deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. \nstrongly support the premise that Applicant would resolve any attempt to exert pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of the U.S.   \n \nGuideline B is a security concern that affects applicants through no fault of their \nown. The current nature of the Iranian government and the hostile relationship between \nIran and the U.S. make it a substantial burden to mitigate the concerns raised under \nforeign influence.  In Applicant\u2019s case, his significant personal relationships and \ncontacts within the U.S. outweigh the concerns raised by having relatives who are \ncitizens and reside in Iran. Overall, the record evidence leaves no questions or doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Foreign Influence \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Cervi, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant used and continues to possess a currently valid Polish passport, which \nhe renewed in 2005 for travel to Poland after he became a U.S. citizen. He voted in a \nPolish referendum after becoming a U.S. citizen. Security concerns pertaining to foreign \npreference are not mitigated. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 15, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (Item 4). \nOn June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him (Item 1), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR alleges \nNovember 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ne.    \n                                           \nsecurity concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The SOR detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn July 21, 2008, DOHA received Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR allegations, \nand he notified DOHA that he wanted to have an administrative judge decide his case \nwithout a hearing (Item 3). A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), \ndated September 5, 2008, was provided to him, and he was afforded an opportunity to \nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant \ndid not provide additional documents within the 30 days. On November 19, 2008, the \ncase was assigned to m\n  \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI took administrative notice of some basic facts concerning Poland, as well as \nPoland\u2019s relationship to the United States.2 These facts are unnecessary for resolution \nof security concerns involving foreign preference. However, facts about Poland\u2019s \ngovernment and relationship to the United States are pertinent mitigating information \nunder the whole person concept. Poland is a democracy and an important ally of the \nUnited States and these factors among others are described infra in the section of this \nopinion labeled \u201cPoland.\u201d3  \n \n \n \n1Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated September 9, 2008, \nand Applicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated September 11, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed \nApplicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n2Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. \nImmigration and Naturalization  Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for \nadministrative notice at ISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government \nreports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts \nfor administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative information from the \ninternet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous \ndocuments). In this case the source for the facts is the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of European \nand Eurasian Affairs, June 2008, \u201cBackground Note: Poland,\u201d (Administrative Judge\u2019s exhibit (AJ Ex.)

His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and has worked for a government contractor since \nFebruary 2000 as an engineer. He has never been married and does not have any \nchildren. He earned a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 2000. Applicant and \nhis parents were born in Poland. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in January 2001 (Item \n5 at 18). His parents became U.S. citizens in 2004, and currently live in the United \nStates. The remainder of his family lives in Poland (Item 5 at 14).    \n \nForeign Preference \n  \n \nApplicant received a U.S. passport in March 2001 (Item 4). In July 2005, \nAppellant renewed his Polish passport, and it remains valid until July 2015 (Item 5 at 2-\n3). A copy of his Polish passport is attached to DOHA interrogatories (Item 5 at 21). The \nFORM and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege that Appellant was unwilling to surrender his \ncurrently valid Polish passport (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Appellant admitted these allegations were \ntrue (Item 3). He used his Polish passport when visiting Poland and used his U.S. \npassport when visiting other countries. Applicant\u2019s SOR response states as of March \n26, 2008, he was unwilling to surrender his Polish passport and explained he needs his \nPolish passport to travel to Poland. Applicant has not surrendered his Polish passport to \nhis security officer, destroyed it in the presence of his security officer, or otherwise \ninvalidated or relinquished it. \n \nIn the last seven years, Appellant traveled to Poland in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, \n2004 and 2006 (Item 1). In July 2003, Appellant voted in the referendum regarding \nPoland\u2019s accession into the European Union (Item 5 at 6; SOR \u00b6 1.f). Appellant is \ninterested in Polish politics and has attended lectures at universities and meetings at \nthe Polish Embassy with high-level Polish government officials (Item 1). \n \nPoland5 \n \nPoland is a democratic, constitutional republic with checks and balances among \nthe president, prime minister, courts and parliament. The constitution includes judicial \nreview, the legislative process and civil rights such as free speech, press and assembly \n(AJ Ex. at 1). \n \n \n \n4Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. Items 3 (response to SOR) and 5 (responses to DOHA \nInterrogatories) are the sources for the facts in this section unless stated otherwise. \n \n5See Administrative Notice, supra. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nPoland is a member of the World Trade Organization and European Union (AJ \nEx I at 6). Poland became a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n(NATO) in March 1999 (AJ Ex. I at 7). \u201cPoland\u2019s top national security goal is to further \nintegrate with NATO and other west European defense, economic, and political \ninstitutions while modernizing and reorganizing its military\u201d (AJ Ex. I at 7). Poland is \nreceiving U.S. assistance in the modernization of defense forces including acquiring F-\n16  multi-role fighters and C-130 cargo planes, High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled \nVehicles (HMMWVs), and other important U.S. military materials. \n \nPoland and the United States have had warm bilateral relationships since 1989, \nand work closely together in a variety of diplomatic and military endeavors: \n \nEvery post-1989 Polish government has been a strong supporter of \ncontinued American military and economic presence in Europe. As well as \nsupporting the Global War on Terror, Operation Enduring Freedom in \nAfghanistan, and coalition efforts in Iraq, Poland cooperates closely with \nAmerican diplomacy on such issues as democratization, nuclear \nproliferation, human rights, regional cooperation in central and eastern \nEurope, and UN reform.   \n \nAE I at 8. Clearly, the United States and Poland are close political, military and \ndiplomatic allies in many areas.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guidelines C (Foreign \nPreference) and B (Foreign Influence).  \n \nForeign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and 10(a)(7) describe conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. These conditions state, \u201c10(a) exercise of any right, \nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the \nforeign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession \nof a current foreign passport; .  .  . and (7) voting in a foreign election.\u201d \n \nApplicant renewed his Polish passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. He \ncontinues to possess a Polish passport that will continue to be valid until 2015, \nestablishing AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). He voted in a Polish referendum in 2003, establishing AG \u00b6 \n10(a)(7).  \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority. \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Security officials did not authorize \nApplicant\u2019s use of the Polish passport and he did not invalidate or relinquish his Polish \npassport as described in AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(d) and 11(e).6 His Polish passport was not \nsurrendered to his security officer. Applicant\u2019s vote in the Polish referendum was not \nencouraged by the U.S. government. He obtained the Polish passport and voted in the \nPolish referendum after he became a U.S. citizen.     \n \n \n6In the decretal paragraph, I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.a because it essentially \nsummarizes why the other SOR allegations are a security concern and does not include factual \nallegations about security concerns. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis.  Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3, \u201cThe ultimate determination of whether the granting or \ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful \nconsideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nThere are significant factors supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s foreign preference concerns relate to Poland, a \nmember of the World Trade Organization, European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization with a democratic, republic form of government. Poland is a close ally of \nthe United States on battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq. The United States has \nprovided sophisticated military technology to Poland, showing the close, trusting nature \nof the military and diplomatic relationship between Poland and the United States. \nApplicant has been a U.S. citizen since 2001. When he became a U.S. citizen, he took \nan oath of allegiance to the United States. His parents live in the United States and \nhave become U.S. citizens. There is no evidence of any performance or work-related \nproblems. He is a law-abiding U.S. citizen, who has been contributing to the U.S. \nnational defense.  \n \nThe foreign preference security concerns are more substantial. After becoming a \nU.S. citizen in 2001, Applicant voted in a Polish referendum in 2003 and renewed his \nPolish passport in 2005. He has used his Polish passport for his 1999, 2001, 2002, \n2003, 2004 and 2006 visits to Poland. He did not relinquish or surrender his Polish \npassport to Polish officials or security officials.      \n \nAfter carefully weighing the evidence, I conclude Applicant has failed to carry his \nburden of mitigating the foreign preference security concerns. I take this position based \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \non the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \n\u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d (See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 \n(App. Bd. June 28, 2006)) and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent \nfactors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b to 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 12, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred in admitting certain\nofficial notice documents; and whether the Judge erred in failing to mitigate the Guideline B security\nconcerns in his case.   Finding no harmful error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an information\ntechnology manager.  He was born and raised in Iran.  He attended college in the U.S., graduating\nin the mid-1980s.  About the same time, he received permanent resident status.  Applicant became\na U.S. citizen in the early 1990s.  He renewed his Iranian passport in the late 1990s upon discovering\nthat he would need it to travel to Iran.  He has since let it expire.  Applicant\u2019s wife was born in Iran.\nShe met Applicant in the late 1990s during a trip to another country.  She immigrated to the U.S. on\na \u201cfianc\u00e9 visa.\u201d  She and Applicant were married shortly thereafter.  Applicant\u2019 wife\u2019s parents are\ncitizens and residents of Iran who have applied to immigrate to the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s wife talks with\nher parents monthly, while Applicant speaks with them every three months.  Applicant has traveled\nto Iran twice since becoming a U.S. citizen, the second time along with his wife for the purpose of\nhaving a formal wedding.  Applicant\u2019s wife made a trip to Iran in the late 2000s to visit her parents.\nShe used her Iranian passport for travel and retains the option of renewing it should circumstances\nrequire a return to Iran.  The U.S. does not have diplomatic relations with Iran, which has committed\nserious human rights violations in recent years.  Iran does not recognize dual nationals, treating them\nas Iranian citizens.  Persons of Iranian birth who have become U.S. citizens risk detention absent\n\u201cpersuasive proof of their formal renunciation or loss of their Iranian citizenship[.]\u201d  Decision at 8\nThe Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) The errors contained in the \u201cSummary of Pleadings\u201d section\nof the decision do not impugn the sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  Viewed in light of the\nrecord as a whole, any errors in the Judge\u2019s findings are harmless.   See ISCR 01-23362 at 2 (App.\n\n\u201c[U]pon fully considering Applicant\u2019s explanations about his wife\u2019s strong relationships with her parents,\n2\n[wife\u2019s] own accounts of her visits and regular contacts with her parents residing in Iran, and [wife\u2019s] continued access\nto her parents through her retained Iranian passport, risks of undue foreign influence on Applicant, his wife and her\nfamily members residing in Iran cannot be safely discounted.\u201d  Decision at 13.   \n3\nBd.

Applicant argues on appeal that the Judge erred in assigning\nsecurity significance to Applicant\u2019s wife, since she was not the subject of a SOR allegation.\nHowever, the Judge considered the wife in the context of Applicant\u2019s in-laws, who are citizens and\nresidents of Iran.  \u201c[I]n-laws represent a class of persons who are contemplated by the Directive as\npresenting a potential security risk.  As a matter of common sense and human experience, there is\na rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family\nmembers of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 03-26176 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2005). \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s weighing of the mitigating evidence, which Applicant\ncharacterizes as \u201coverwhelming.\u201d  The weighing of the evidence is within a Judge\u2019s discretion and\nwill not be disturbed by the Board absent a showing that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner\nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, or not supported by the record as a whole.  See, e.\ng., ISCR Case No. 05-10921 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2007).  There is no such showing here.  \n The Board finds no error in the manner in which the Judge addressed security concerns\narising out of Applicant\u2019s in-laws.   After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\n2\nexamined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a\n\u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant\u2019s background Applicant was born and raised in Iran and attended private schools there. He immigrated to the U.S. in 1978 at the age of 16 to pursue his education (R.T., at 72). At the time, Iran was an important ally of the U.S., and Applicant considered U.S.-Iran relations to be good (R.T., at 73-74). Shortly after his arrival in the U.S., he began to notice increasing anti-American demonstrations in Iran in the unfolding revolution in Iran that would culminate in the toppling of the Shah in 1979 (R.T., at 75-78). After completing his high school education in the U.S., Applicant studied in U.S. colleges and received a bachelor of arts degree in international relations in 1986 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 82-83). 4 Applicant applied for and was granted permanent residence status in 1986 (R.T., at 81-82).

A hearing was held on December 2, 2008, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

See ISCR Case No. 05-11292, at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. April 12,\n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875, at 2 (App. Bd. October 12, 2006)(citing ISCR Case No.\n02-18668, at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)).  Administrative notice is appropriate for\nnoticing facts or government reports that are well known.  See Stein, Administrative Law,\nSec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical\nsituation in Iran.  Administrative notice was extended to the documents themselves,\nconsistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.  This notice did  not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the\nreports addressing Iran\u2019s current state.  \nProcedural Issues and Rulings\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with written character endorsements.  For good cause shown, Applicant was\ngranted seven days to December 8, 2008, to supplement the record.  The Government\nwas afforded two days to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant faxed\nendorsements from his chief executive officer (CEO) and facility clearance officer (FSO),\nwhich were, in turn, e-mailed to me. These submissions are admitted as Applicant\u2019s\nexhibits B and C. \n\n3 \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to (a) have an aunt and uncle who are\ncitizens and residents of Iran, (b) have an aunt who is employed as an accounting\nmanager for an Iranian government department, \u00a9) have an uncle who is retired from the\nsame Iranian government department, (d) have five maternal aunts who are citizens and\nresidents of Iran, (e) to have told an authorized DoD investigator in March 2007 that he\ncould only be vulnerable to blackmail or coercion by foreign interests if his parents and\n/or brothers were in danger while traveling to Iran, and (f) to have told the same DoD\ninvestigator that he has not renounced his dual citizenship with Iran due to possible\nthreats to his aunts and uncles currently residing in Iran. \nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the allegations in the SOR\nwith explanations, and denied others.  He admitted to applying for and holding an Iranian\npassport to enable him to travel and visit his family in Iran on the two occasions alleged\nin the SOR, and only because Iranian authorities would not permit him to exit Iran\nwithout a valid Iranian passport (his was expired).  He admitted to using his Iranian\npassport to enable him to enter and exit Iran, fearing that if he showed his U.S. passport\nit could be confiscated, and renewing his expired Iranian passport in 2003 to ensure his\ngetting out of Iran.  Applicant admitted, too, that his father-in-law and mother-in-law are\ncitizens and residents of Iran, but claimed that it is unlikely that his in-laws would be\npressured by Iranian authorities, and that if they were, he would resist any pressures and\nimmediately report the event to his FSO and seek assistance from the proper authorities.\nApplicant denied exercising dual citizenship, claiming that neither Iran nor the U.S.\nrecognize dual citizenship, since they do not have diplomatic relations with one another.\nApplicant provided additional background material about his emigration to the U.S., his\neducational pursuits in the U.S., his work history and professional reputation he enjoys\nwithin his company, and his maintained familial relationships.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 47-year-old information technology manager for a defense\ncontractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings\nfollow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born and raised in Iran and attended private schools there.  He\nimmigrated to the U.S. in 1978 at the age of 16 to pursue his education (R.T., at 72).  At\nthe time, Iran was an important ally of the U.S., and Applicant considered U.S.-Iran\nrelations to be good (R.T., at 73-74).   Shortly after his arrival in the U.S., he began to\nnotice increasing anti-American demonstrations in Iran in the unfolding revolution in Iran\nthat would culminate in the toppling of the Shah in 1979 (R.T., at 75-78).  After\ncompleting his high school education in the U.S., Applicant studied in U.S. colleges and\nreceived a bachelor of arts degree in international relations in 1986 (see ex. 1; R.T., at\n82-83). \n\n4 \nApplicant applied for and was granted permanent residence status in 1986 (R.T.,\nat 81-82).  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1992 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 82).\nHe obtained a U.S. passport in October 2000, and has continually possessed a valid one\nthereafter.  Applicant renewed his expired Iranian passport in August 1997, once he\nlearned he would need one to travel to Iran (R.T., at 105).  He had permitted his Iranian\npassport to expire after obtaining his U.S. passport, and then subsequently renewing it.\nSee infra. \nApplicant\u2019s  wife (W) was born in Iran in 1979, and was raised by Iranian parents\nwho are citizens of Iran and still reside in that country.  Applicant met W in 1997 while on\na trip to Turkey to visit relatives (R.T., at 40-41).  Applicant returned to Iran (for the first\ntime since immigrating to the U.S.) in September 1999 to visit his own parents and meet\nW\u2019s parents (R.T., at 45-46, 87-88).  Concerned about possible conscription into the\nIranian Army as a dual national, he paid $1,000.00 to buy out his military obligation\nbefore embarking on his trips to Iran (R.T., at 87).\nWhen traveling to Iran in 1999, Applicant used his Iranian passport out of\nperceived necessity:  He was advised that he could not enter and exit the country without\na valid Iranian passport, irrespective of whether he was also a U.S. citizen who\npossessed a valid U.S. passport (see response; R.T. at 89-90).  Iran and the U.S. have\nno diplomatic relations, and Applicant was impressed that Iran does not recognize an\nIranian\u2019s citizen\u2019s dual citizenship with another country (R.T., at 90).  Nevertheless,\nApplicant does not consider himself to be a dual citizen, but rather an exclusive citizen of\nthe U.S. (R.T., at 91, 95-96)\nW immigrated to the U.S. in November 2000 on a fianc\u00e9 visa (R.T., at 41) that\nrequired she marry within 90 days of her arrival in the U.S. (R.T., at 41-42).  W and\nApplicant married within 30 days of her arrival, and W became a naturalized U.S. citizen\nin 2005 (R.T., at 43).  Only Applicant\u2019s parents and brother attended this wedding\nceremony (R.T., at 55-56); W\u2019s parents remained in Iran (R.T., at 55).  W has no political\naffiliations (R.T., at 47).  Her parents have since applied for immigration to the U.S. and\nrecently were interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in Dubai (R.T., at 51-52).  W expects her\nparents\u2019 visas to be approved soon\nApplicant and W returned to Iran in June 2003 to exchange their marriage vows in\na formal wedding (R.T., at 54-55).  They each relied on their Iranian passports for entry\nand exit into Iran.  When Applicant showed his Iranian passport to Iranian airport\nauthorities upon their arrival in Iran, he was told his passport had expired and would\nneed to be renewed before he could depart from Iran (R.T., at 117-18).  He showed the\nauthorities his U.S. passport as well and was told it could not be used to facilitate his exit\nfrom the country; even though he was a dual U.S. citizen (R.T.,  at 93-94).  To use his\nU.S. passport would require an Iranian visa, which Iranian authorities do not provide to\nits Iranian citizens (R.T., at 94, 119-22). So, Applicant  renewed his Iranian passport\nwhile in Iran and used it in his return to the U.S.  Applicant documents the surrender of\nhis Iranian passport to his FSO in December 2008 (see ex. A; R.T., at 97).   He hedged\nsome on renouncing his Iranian citizenship. \n\n5 \nApplicant would prefer to keep his Iranian citizenship to make it easier for him to\nreturn to Iran should the need arise (R.T., at 91).  Expressly afforded an opportunity to\nconsider an affirmative renunciation of his Iranian citizenship after the hearing and\ndocument his intentions, Applicant did not provide any post-hearing documentation.  \n W\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Iran (R.T., at 49-50).  Her father is a\nmechanical engineer for a publicly owned cement company (R.T., at 49).  She does not\nknow whether it is owned by the Iranian government.  Her mother is a homemaker (R.T.,\nat 50).  Besides her parents, W has a brother who lives in the Ukraine.  W\u2019s parents have\nrecently taken their first steps towards eventually immigrating to the U.S. and recently\nwere  interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in Dubai (R.T., at 51-52, 111).  Before they can\nobtain visas to travel to the U.S., however, they must complete another U.S. interview\n(R.T., at 100).   While W expects her parents\u2019 visas to be approved soon, she could\nprovide  any specific time estimates for an approval date (R.T., at 60).  Applicant and W\nlove W\u2019s parents and maintain regular contact with them; specifically, W\u2019s talks with her\nparents monthly, while Applicant communicates with them only once every three months\non average  (R.T., at 61-62).  Both are committed to protecting W\u2019s parents (R.T., at 63).\nThey both expect W\u2019s parents to emigrate to the U.S. if and when visas are approved for\nthem (R.T., at 60-61).  \nIn 2007, W made a trip to Iran (without Applicant) to visit her parents who had\nbeen pressing her to come see them (R.T., at 58, 98-99).  On this trip, W used her\nretained Iranian passport to enter and exit Iran; there were no other viable options\navailable to her (R.T., at 65, 98).  This passport is scheduled to expire soon, and\nApplicant will need to renew the passport should she ever elect to return to Iran (R.T., at\n65-66). She made no public vow to surrender her Iranian passport, and retains the option\nto renew it should circumstances warrant that she return to Iran.  \nNeither Applicant nor W are aware of any potential pressures or coercive\nmeasures that could be applied to bear on any of Applicant/W\u2019s family members residing\nin the U.S. (his immediate family), or in Iran (W\u2019s family).  Applicant assures that should\nhe become aware of any pressures or coercion on any of his family members, he would\nresist the same and notify his FSO (R.T., at 101-02).  If called to arms in a hypothetical\nwar with Iran, Applicant would be willing to bear arms against Iran in behalf of the U.S.\n(R.T., at 110). \nApplicant has never served in the Iranian military or voted in an Iranian election.\nHe has no assets in Iran and considerable real estate (valued near $800,000.00) and\nother assets (including shares in his company valued at around $9,000.00 and a\nretirement account valued about $30,000.00) in the U.S. (R.T., at 107).  He estimates his\nU.S.-based net worth to be around $900,000.00 (R.T., at 108).  Applicant has no vested\neducational, medical, or retirement benefits in Iran and no contingency plans to obtain\nany.   His parents immigrated to the U.S. a number of years ago and currently reside in\nthe U.S.   His only sibling is his brother who immigrated to the U.S. with Applicant in\n1979 and (like Applicant) became a naturalized citizen of the U.S.  His brother (who is\ndivorced with no children) continues to reside in the U.S. (R.T., at 109).  Applicant has\nhad nothing to do with the Iranian government since immigrating to this country and has\nnever worked for the Iranian government in any capacity.  Applicant does have a living\n\n6 \naunt (contacts unclear) who resides in Iran, and a number of distant cousins \u201chere and\nthere\u201d (R.T., at 113).  To the best of his knowledge, none of these cousins have any\nemployment or relationships with the Iranian government (R.T., at 114).\nPolitical and economic background of Iran\nAccording to official U.S. State Department documents, Iran is an Islamic republic\nthat is constitutionally constructed and has a head of state, an elected president and\ncounsel of ministers, a legislative body composed of a 290-member Islamic consultative\nassembly, and a judiciary (see Background Note on Iran, supra, at 5).  Throughout its\nlong history, Iran has been ruled by numerous dynasties.  Following a nationalist uprising\nagainst the Shah in 1905, Iran enacted a limited constitution in 1906.  Two years later, oil\nwas discovered, and Iran began its steady ascension  to a modern, secularized political\nsystem.  Under the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi (an Iranian officer, who seized control of\nthe government in 1921), Iran enacted policies of modernization and secularization,\nestablished a central government and reasserted its authority over the tribes and\nprovinces (see Background Note on Iran, id., at 3).  During the Allied occupation of\nwestern Iran in 1941, the Shah was forced to abdicate and was succeeded by his son,\nMohammad Reza Pahlavi (see Background Note on Iran, id.).\nDomestic turmoil swept Iran in 1978 as the result of heated religious and political\nopposition to the Shah\u2019s rule and political/economic programs (especially the Shah\u2019s\ninternal security and intelligence service).  And in February 1979, exiled religious leader\nAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned from France to direct a revolution resulting in a\nnew, theocratic republic guided by Islamic principles.  Iran\u2019s 1979 constitution allocates\nthe duties of the chosen religious leaders and governing bodies in such a way that their\nduties often overlap.  Legislative issues on which the Majles (Iran\u2019s legislative governing\nbody) and the Council of Guardians (making up Iran\u2019s religious leadership) fail to agree\nare resolved by the Council of Expediency (a body created by Ayatollah Khomeini in\n1988).  Following the Ayatollah\u2019s death in June 1989, the Assembly of Experts (an\nelected body of senior clerics) chose the outgoing president of the republic (Ali\nKhamenei) to be the Ayatollah\u2019s successor as national religious leader (see Background\nNote on Iran, id., at 4).\nIran\u2019s post-revolution has been marked by an eight-year war with Iraq, internal\npolitical struggles and unrest, and economic disorder.  Its post-revolution regime has\nbeen associated with human rights violations and political turmoil, including the seizure\nof the U.S. Embassy in November 1979 by Iranian militants and the hostage taking of 52\nAmericans (see Background Note on Iran, supra, at 6).  Succeeding power struggles\nhave severely eroded the center and left of Iran\u2019s political institutions, leaving only the\nclergy.  Both human rights and state sponsored terrorism remain serious problems in\nIran and the Middle East.  According to State Department reports, Iran\u2019s Islamic\nRevolutionary Guard Corps and Ministry of Intelligence and Security Forces have been\ndirectly involved in terrorist acts, and continue to support Palestinian groups with\nleadership cadres in Syria and Lebanese Hizballah to use terrorism in pursuit of their\ngoals (see Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2007, supra, at 1-5; Country\nReports on terrorism , Chapter 3 - State Sponsors of Terrorism Overview, supra, at 1-2).\nState Department reports claim Iranian authorities continue to provide military support\n\n7 \nand guidance to some Iraqi militant groups that target Coalition and Iraqi security forces\nand Iraqi civilians (see Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 3 - State Sponsors of\nTerrorism Overview, id.).\n Long estranged from the West, Khomeini\u2019s regime charted regional goals that\ncurtail the presence of the U.S. and other outside powers in the region.  Iran\u2019s Islamic\nforeign policy continues to stress (1) vehement anti-U.S. and anti-Israel positions, (2)\nelimination of outside influence in the region, (3) support for Muslim political movements\nabroad, (4) critical support to non-state terrorist groups, and (5) considerable increase in\ndiplomatic contacts with developing countries (see U.S. Dept. of State Background Note\non Iran, supra; Iran: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2007, supra, at 1-16;\nCountry Reports on Terrorism 2007, Chapter 3 - State Sponsors of Terrorism Overview,\nsupra, at 1-2).  In this vein, Iran maintains regular diplomatic and commercial relations\nwith Russia and the former Soviet republics.  Of special U.S. concern has been Russian\nsales of military equipment and technology to Iran (see  U.S. Dept. of State Background\nNote on Iran, id., at 8).\nPotential obstacles to improved relations between Iran and the U.S. include\nIranian efforts to acquire technology that could be used to develop nuclear weapons and\nother weapons of mass destruction; its support for and involvement in international\nterrorism; its support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and its\ndismal human rights record (see Statement of President George W. Bush, Message to\nthe Congress of the U.S., supra; President of the U.S., Continuation of the National\nEmergency with Respect to Iran, supra; National Intelligence Estimate, Iran, Nuclear\nIntentions and Capabilities, supra; Annual Threat Assessment of the Director of National\nIntelligence for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, supra. \nThe U.S. response to Iran\u2019s problematic policies and behavior has been to try to\nconvince Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions, cease its support  of terrorist\ngroups, and begin the process of forging constructive partnerships in the region.\nLooking to the future, the U.S. has made it abundantly clear to the Iranian government\nthat Iran has an historic opportunity to restore the confidence of the international\ncommunity in its nuclear intentions and provide its own people important access to\ntechnology, nuclear energy, education, and foreign investment (see Testimony of Under\nSecretary William J. Burns, The Strategic Challenges Posed by Iran, supra, at 4-8).  This\ndual track strategy of the U.S. is broad based and is designed to build cooperative\nrelationships with Iran and promote Iran\u2019s relationship with the international community.\nThe strategy has yet to produce any material results, and remains a work in progress. \nState Department country reports cite significant restrictions on the right of\ncitizens to change their government, summary executions (minors included),\ndisappearances, torture and severe punishments (such as amputations and flogging),\nviolence by vigilante groups with ties to the government, poor prison conditions, arbitrary\narrest and detention (including prolonged solitary confinement), lack of judicial\nindependence and fair public trials, political prisoners and detainees, excessive\ngovernment violence in Kurdish areas and unknown groups in Arab regions of the\ncountry, severe restrictions on civil liberties and freedom of religion, official corruption,\ngovernment transparency deficiencies, legal and societal discrimination against women,\n\n8 \nethnic and religious minorities, trafficking in persons, incitement of anti-Semitism, severe\nrestriction of workers\u2019 rights, and child labor (see Iran, Country Reports on Human Rights\nPractices-2007, supra, at 1-24). \nAddressing reports of human rights violations in Iran, the UN General Assembly\nadopted a human rights resolution on Iran in December 2005 that expressed serious\nconcern at the continuing use of torture in Iran and cruel, trafficking in persons, inhuman\nand degrading treatment or punishment, such as floggings and amputations, as well as\npublic executions (see Iran, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2007, supra,\nid., at 3-24). \nEven though Iran\u2019s constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, these\npractices remain common. Its regular and paramilitary security forces that share\nresponsibility with Iranian police for law enforcement and maintaining order are reported\nto have committed numerous, serious human rights abuses in recent years (see Iran,\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices-2007, Iran, supra.). Security forces\nresponsible for arrest and detention often do not inform family members of a prisoner\u2019s\nwelfare and locations, and often deny visits by family members and counsel.\nState Department travel warnings urge U.S. citizens to carefully consider the risks\nof travel to Iran (see Travel Warning, Iran, 2008, supra), a country with which the U.S.\ndoes not currently have diplomatic or consular relations.  Citing Iran\u2019s non-recognition of\ndual citizenship and general declination to permit the Swiss to provide protective\nservices for U.S. citizens who are also Iranian nationals, Americans who travel to Iran\nare strongly encouraged to register through the State Department\u2019s travel registration\nwebsite (see Travel Warning, Iran, 2008, id.).\nDual citizens residing or visiting in Iran are subject to all Iranian laws affecting\nU.S. citizens, as well as laws applicable to persons of Iranian nationality that impose\nspecial obligations on citizens of that country (see Travel Warning, Iran, 2008, id.; Iran,\nCountry Specific Information, supra, at 1-2).  Dual nationals remain subject to Iran\u2019s\nmilitary service requirements and can be conscripted into service while on Iranian soil.\nWhile such conscripted service seems unlikely to confront Applicant, given his age,\nlongstanding U.S. citizenship, and avowed intent not to return to Iran, it remains a\npossibility.  Reports indicate, too, that Iranian security personnel may at times place\nforeign visitors under surveillance, and even arrest or detain Iranian-Americans\nsuspected of \u201cacting against national security\u201d  (see Iran, Country Reports on Human\nRights Practices-2007, supra, at 5-6; Iran, Country Specific Information,  id., at 2-3). \n Because the Iranian government does not recognize dual nationality and will treat\nU.S.-Iranian dual nationals as Iranian citizens, regardless of their U.S. naturalization\nstatus, dual nationals who enter Iran only on a U.S. passport risk detention absent\npersuasive proof of their formal renunciation or loss of their Iranian citizenship (see Iran,\nCountry Specific Information, Iran, supra,  at 1-2).  Applicant and W each manifest\nconsiderable awareness of Iran\u2019s historical treatment of dual nationals, and have taken\nmeasures to accommodate Iranian border practices through their use of Iranian\npassports to enter and exit the country (see ex. 3; R.T., at 65, 93-94).\n\n9 \nCharacter assessments\nApplicant has received excellent endorsements from his company\u2019s management.\nHis CEO describes Applicant as a dependable manager who has never given him\nreason to doubt his trustworthiness (see ex. B; R.T., at 103).  Applicant\u2019s FSO\ncharacterizes Applicant as trustworthy and conscientious and a valued manager since\njoining his company in 2003 (see ex. C).  The FSO expressed his familiarity with the oath\nof U.S. citizenship that Applicant took at his naturalization ceremony in 2003 (ex. C).\nThis oath includes a renunciation of allegiance and fidelity to any foreign state or\nsovereign and a corresponding commitment to support and defend the Constitution and\nlaws of the U.S. This recited oath does not include any expressed renunciation of foreign\ncitizenship as a condition of acceptance of U.S. citizenship (see ex. C).  Both Applicant\nand W are in agreement that Iranian recognition of their status as U.S. citizens,\nexclusively, requires an express act of renunciation by Applicant.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\n Foreign Preference\nThe Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may\nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the\ninterests of the United States.  See Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 9.\n                       Foreign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nthe individual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under the this\nGuideline can and should considered the identity of the foreign country in\n\n10 \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism (see Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6).\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nBorn and raised in Iran, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1992.  He\nmet his wife (a dual citizen with Iran) in 1997, and married her in 1999.  Security\nconcerns focus on Applicant\u2019s exercise of dual citizenship with Iran through his\npossession and use of an Iranian passport.  Security concerns are also directed at the\ncitizenship and residency status of W\u2019s parents who are Iranian citizens residing in Iran.\nApplicant and his wife and family have deep roots in Iran, a country historically known to\npractice terrorism, and to exercise repression and human rights abuses against its own\ncitizens, as well as dual citizens who visit the country.\nForeign preference issues\nDual citizenship concerns necessarily entail allegiance assessments and invite\ncritical considerations over acts indicating a preference or not for the interests of the\nforeign country over the interests of the U.S.  The issues, as such, raise concerns over\nApplicant\u2019s  preference for a foreign country over the U.S.\n\n11 \nBy virtue of his birth to parents of Iranian descent, Applicant was endowed with\nIranian citizenship, which could be renounced by his expressed intention or actions.\nThis, Applicant  has never done, out of love for his native country (not its government).\nSince becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant has taken no actions and exercised\nno Iranian privileges that can be fairly characterized as active indicia of dual citizenship,\nsave for his limited use of his Iranian passport when traveling to Iran to visit his spouse\nand her family.  He has not voted in Iranian elections or served in the Iranian military. \nBy all accounts, all of Applicant\u2019s assets are located in the U.S., where he has\nresided since 1979.  He has accepted no preferential educational, medical or other\nbenefits from Iran (save for renewing and using his Iranian passport) since becoming a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen.  Nor has he ever performed or attempted to perform duties, or\notherwise acted so as to serve the interests of Iran in preference to the interests of the\nU.S. since becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen.  \nBecause Applicant possessed and used his Iranian passport on several occasions\nbefore surrendering it to his FSO in 2008, the Government may apply disqualifying\ncondition (DC) \u00b6 10(a), which provides:\nexercise of any right, privilege or obligations of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n (1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n (2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other \nsuch benefits from a foreign country; \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in                 \n            another country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and\n(7) voting in a foreign election.  \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s use of his Iranian passport was limited to the three times he\nused it to enter and exit Iran in 1999 and 2003.  He never voted in an Iranian election\nand never served in the Iranian military.  He has never sought to hold political office in\nIran or used his Iranian citizenship to protect his financial or business interests.  His\ndemonstrated loyalties and commitments have consistently been directed to the U.S.\nand its institutions and core values. \nBy relinquishing his Iranian passport, Applicant has complied with the mitigation\nrequirements of MC \u00b6 11 (e), \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\n\n12 \ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated,\u201d of AG \u00b6 18. And while his\nsurrendering his Iranian passport to his assistant FSO does not automatically mitigate\nany past use of the passport to enter and exit Iran, his recited limited use of the passport\nis insufficient by itself to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s preference for Iran over the U.S.\nFailure to satisfy a mitigating condition may be taken into account when\nassessing an applicant\u2019s overall claim of extenuation, mitigation, or changed\ncircumstances, but may not be turned into a disqualifying condition.  See ISCR Case No.\n01-02270 (Appeal Bd. Aug. 29, 2003).  That Applicant may wish to keep his Iranian\ncitizenship out of love for his birth country is not sufficient reason either to preclude him\nfrom mitigating security concerns over his holding dual citizenship, if those rights do not\nentail his exacting preferential retirement privileges from Iran.  \nWhole person precepts favor Applicant\u2019s preference for the U.S. over Iran.  He is\na U.S. citizen by birth and has always demonstrated his loyalty and commitments to the\nU.S.  His principal financial interests are situated in the U.S.  And his time spent in Iran\non his two acknowledged visits were each relatively brief and devoted to visits to W and\nher family.   The high praise he is accorded by his program manager and FSO reinforce\nhis credible assurances that he is a patriotic U.S. citizen dedicated to protecting U.S.\nsecurity interests.  \nOverall, Applicant persuades that his preference is with the U.S.  He satisfies his\nproof burden in several ways: demonstrated lack of any prior exercise of any privileges\nassociated with his Iranian citizenship, save for his limited use of his Iranian passport.\nApplicant absolves himself of foreign preference concerns  and carries his evidentiary\nburden on the presented issue of whether his preference lies with his adopted country\n(U.S.) or his native country (Iran).  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d of Guideline C.\nForeign influence issues\nThe Government also urges security concerns over risks associated with\nApplicant\u2019s wife (a naturalized U.S. citizen who retains dual citizenship with Iran and an\nIranian passport)  and her parents, who are citizens of Iran and reside there.  Key to the\nGovernment\u2019s foreign influence concerns are W\u2019s possession and use of an Iranian\npassport to visit her parents in Iran. This close relationship between Applicant, W and\nher parents makes them potentially vulnerable to coercion and non-coercive measures\nbecause of where W\u2019s parents live and her travel access to them.  Because Iranian\ngovernment military and intelligence authorities have a history of violating Iranian and\ninternational laws and diplomatic protocols, they are more likely to use improper and/or\nillegal means to obtain classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control through\nW and her parents. \nBy virtue of the Iranian citizenship and residency of W\u2019s parents in Iran and W\u2019s\npersonal access to them through her use and retention of an Iranian passport, they\npresent potential heightened security risks covered by disqualifying condition  (DC) 7(a),\n\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\n\n13 \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d\nof the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence. The citizenship/residence status of\nthese family members in Iran pose potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks\nof undue foreign influence that could compromise sensitive or classified information\nunder Applicant's possession and/or control. \nAlthough none of W\u2019s family have any identified Iranian prior military or\ngovernment service, or other demonstrated links to the Iranian government, they remain\nvulnerable to potential compromise and coercion for so long as they reside in Iran.  Were\neither of these family members to placed in a hostage situation, Applicant could be\nsubject to conflicts over ensuring his family\u2019s well being and protecting classified\ninformation. For this reason, DC 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s\nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d is applicability to\nthe facts of this case.  True, none of W\u2019s immediate family residing in Iran have any\nhistory to date of being subjected to any coercion or influence.  These historical\nantecedents do limit the severity of a conflict situation.  However, the absence of any\npast coercive measures taken by Iranian authorities does not absolve Applicant from\ncoercive risks in the future given Iran\u2019s rich history of hostage taking and abusive\nmeasures taken against its own citizens.\nStill, upon fully considering Applicant\u2019s explanations about his wife\u2019s strong\nrelationships with her parents, W\u2019s own accounts of her visits and regular contacts with\nher parents residing in Iran, and W\u2019s continued access to her parents through her\nretained Iranian passport, risks of undue foreign influence on Applicant, his wife and her\nfamily members residing in Iran, cannot be safely discounted.  Applicant/W\u2019s contacts\nwith W\u2019s parents are significant and ongoing (though quite understandable), and are\nclearly of the magnitude that could make them subject to a heightened security risk of\npressure or compromise under Guideline B.\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing security clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for any chosen set of guidelines covering risks of\nforeign influence.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country\nmay not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be\nweighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing.  Personnel\nsecurity assessments necessarily embrace similar risk assessments under the new\nDirective guidelines for assessing foreign influence risks and concerns associated with\nthe individual's having family abroad, which include both common sense assessments of\ncountry risks and information available from public sources. \nUnlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, though, the new ones do take into account\nthe country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important consideration in\ngauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create\na heightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign\nregime involved do matter. \n\n14 \nAs demonstrated, Iran has long been known to be a repressive country, who has\ncommitted numerous, serious human rights abuses in recent years, and shown little\nrespect for the rule of law.  The U.S. has no diplomatic relations with Iran.  Iran remains\na country on the State Department \u2018s state terrorist list, and one with a known history of\nhostage taking and human rights abuses of wide magnitude and scope. Iran is\nconsistently characterized as a country hostile to American political and security interests\nsince the 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran and ensuing establishment of an Islamic republic\nwith close ties and support to non-state terrorist groups.  Based on reported terrorist\nactivities in the country and in other countries in the region with support links to Iran, Iran\ncannot be deemed to provide an acceptable political and security environment for\nmanaging hostage risks. Without such assurances, no reasonable conclusions can be\nreached that Applicant\u2019s wife (for so long as she holds for potential use her Iranian\npassport) and parents are not in a position to be exploited by Iranian authorities.\nBased on Applicant\u2019s case-specific circumstances, MC 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\npersons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.\u201d  is not available to Applicant.  Neither Applicant nor his wife and parents residing in\nIran can be characterized as sufficiently insulated from potential pressures and influence\nfrom the Iranian government and its military and intelligence officials to warrant\napplication of this mitigating condition. \n Of some benefit to Applicant is MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty and\ncommitment to the U.S. and its institutions and values and the absence of any history of\ncoercive measures taken against any of W\u2019s family members are well supported in this\nadministrative record and Applicant\u2019s very limited contacts and ties with these same\naunts and uncles\nApplicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments to\nthe U.S., while considerable, are not enough to neutralize all potential conflicts that are\nimplicit in his relationships with his spouse and his wife\u2019s parents.  MC 8(c), \u201ccontact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d has some\napplicability based on Applicant\u2019s own infrequent contacts with his wife\u2019s parents residing\nin Iran.  Application of MC 8(c) is necessarily very limited, though, because of the\nfrequent communications W maintains with her parents residing in Iran. \nOne other mitigating condition has mixed application to Applicant\u2019s situation.  MC\n8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements regarding\nthe reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or organizations\nfrom a foreign country,\u201d has some prospective value based on Applicant\u2019s assurances of\nreporting his travel plans to Iran, and his long absence from the country (no visits since\n\n15 \n2003).  But there is really no documented record of Applicant\u2019s prior reporting of his\ncontacts with members of his wife\u2019s family, respectively, to warrant any more than\nminimal consideration at this time.  Historically, our Appeal Board has accorded very little\nweight to stated intentions to take corrective steps in a hypothetical set of circumstances,\nabsent record evidence that an applicant has acted similarly under comparable\ncircumstances.  See ISCR Case No. 07-00029, at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007); ISCR Case\nNo. 06-24575, at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).\nGiven that Iran remains a hostile country with no diplomatic relations with the\nU.S., and one that lacks a secure infrastructure and track record for respecting human\nrights and the rule of law, the risk of a pressure or influence situation involving an\nimmediate or extended family member of Applicant\u2019s cannot be safely discounted.  Iran\u2019s\nstrategic location and political character, W\u2019s retention of her Iranian passport, and the\nresidency of her parents in Iran, all combine to create security concerns over risks of\ndirect or indirect pressure or influence of a family member of Applicant\u2019s by Iranian\nauthorities.\nSecurity concerns over W\u2019s possession of an Iranian passport and strong\nApplicant/W concerns over the well being of W\u2019s parents residing in Iran are significant\nand promise to remain as long as (a) the parents continue to reside in Iran and (b)  Iran\nremains a country hostile to geopolitical U.S. interests. These concerns are not\nsufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to\nwithstand risks of exploitation and pressure attributable to his familial relationships and\ncontacts with his wife\u2019s parents domiciled  in Iran.\nWhole person assessment does not permit mitigation of Applicant\u2019s exposure to\npotential painful choices over ensuring the safety and well being of W and her parents\nand protecting U.S. national security interests.  To his credit, Applicant is a fully\nAmericanized U.S. citizen with demonstrated strong loyalties and commitments to U.S.\ncore values.  The trust he has inspired with his manager and FSO and promises to report\nany Iranian pressures or contacts to his FSO are encouraging indicators he cannot be\npressured or coerced. \nAfter carefully considering Applicant\u2019s familial connections in the U.S. and Iran\nand the risks of Applicant submission to Iranian pressures should W and/or her parents\nbe pressured or coerced by Iranian authorities at some time in the foreseeable future,\nthe weighted risks of a compromise remain too substantial to become manageable ones\nat this time under a whole person assessment of all of the critical circumstances\nconsidered in this case.\nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's relations with\nhis wife and their respective family members residing in Iran are insufficiently mitigated\nto permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue\ninfluence attributable to his wife\u2019s status with her Iranian passport and familial\nrelationships with her parents in Iran.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to\nthe allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a and 1.b of Guideline B. \n\n16 \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2(a) of the Adjudicative Process of\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE C (FOREIGN PREFERENCE);\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a and 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\n In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.

On October 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security concerns for financial \nconsiderations under Guideline F.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 28, 2008. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 28, 2008.  He admitted one of \nthe debts but noted he was unaware of the debt, and denied six of the allegations under \nGuideline F.  He provided proof of payment of two of the debts.  He requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nNovember 14, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on November 19, 2008.  DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on January 13, 2009, for a hearing on February 4, 2009.  I \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered four exhibits, marked \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without objection.  \nApplicant submitted six documents, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A-F, which \nwere received and admitted without objection.  Applicant testified on his behalf.  The \nrecord was left open for Applicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant timely \nsubmitted five additional documents marked App. Ex. G-K.  The government did not \nobject to the admission of the documents (See Gov. Ex. 5, Department Counsel Letter, \ndated February 19, 2009), and the documents are admitted.  DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 19, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case \nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 29 years old and has been a property book logistics specialist for a \ndefense contractor for over two years.  He is married with three children.  He served on \nactive duty in the Army for approximately five years.  His discharge was under Other \nThan Honorable Conditions in lieu of court-martial.  The Army Board for Correction of \nMilitary Records upgraded his discharge to General under Honorable Conditions (App. \nEx. H, DD 214).  He did not hold a security clearance while on active duty.  After he left \nthe Army, Applicant enrolled in college and earned his Bachelor's degree in 3 and a half \nyears.  Applicant's wife handles the family finances.  She especially managed the \nfinances while Applicant was in Iraq for his employer in 2007 to 2008 (Tr. 32-37; Gov. \nEx. 1, SF-86, dated August 6, 2007).  When Applicant served in Iraq for his defense \ncontractor employer, he earned a significant salary (See Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to \nInterrogatories at 72).  Applicant completed this form while assigned in Iraq).  Since \nApplicant's return to the United States, his salary has been reduced.  His net monthly \npay is now $2,072.  He receives $593 per month in Veteran's Administration disability.  \nHis wife's net monthly pay is $2,800 for a combined family income of approximately \n$5,500.  Their monthly recurring expenses are $3,200, leaving a discretionary or \ndisposable funds monthly remainder of $2,200 to $2,300 (Tr. 38-41). \n \nA credit report (Gov. Ex. 4, Credit Report, dated April 2, 2008) shows Applicant \nhad the following delinquent debts; an account in collection for student loans of $1,440 \n(SOR 1.a); a charged off account for $520 (SOR 1.b); a charged off credit card account \nfor $765 (SOR 1.c); a credit card account charged-off for $6,016 (SOR 1.d); a charged \noff department store account for $1,416 (SOR 1.e); a collection account on a credit card \nfor a bank for $943 (SOR 1.f); and a charged off bank loan for $14,135 (SOR 1.g).    \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.a is a student loan in collection for $1,440, from a college \nApplicant attended.  Applicant completed his Bachelor's degree and started classes \ntowards a Masters of Business Administration degree.  After starting the fall semester, \nhe took a position in Iraq for his employer and had to drop the course.  He was not \naware that he had incurred an expense for not completing the course.  After learning of \nthe debt, Applicant entered a payment plan with the collection agency for the university \nand has been paying $100 per month on the debt.  The balance on the debt is now less \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthan $1,000 (Tr. 13-16, 20-21; Appellant Exhibits A and B, Bank Statements, dated \nDecember 23, 2008, and November 20, 2008).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.b is an account in collection for a retail store for $520.  \nApplicant had a payment plan with a credit organization and was informed by them that \nthis account had been paid in full.  However, he had not been able to verify the payment \nor receive a letter that the account was paid.  After the hearing as requested, Applicant \ncontacted the retail store and requested payment information on the account.  He was \ninformed the account had been paid and was closed.  He was informed twice that \ndocuments verifying this information would be sent to him.  Applicant had not received \nthe documents from the store at the deadline imposed for him to forward documents (Tr. \n20-22; App. Ex. G, Letter, undated). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.c is an account in collection for a credit card for $765.  \nApplicant's wife paid this debt by electronic transfer, but he does not have a receipt for \nthe payment (Tr. 18-19).  After the hearing, Applicant called the credit card company \nand was informed the account had been sold to a law firm (App. Ex. G, Letter, undated).  \nThe law firm was placed in receivership and is no longer in business.  The credit card \ncompany cancelled all debts to them that were being collected by the law firm.  Because \nof the action of the law firm, Applicant cannot verify payment (App. Ex. K, Article, \nNovember 26, 2008).  However, the receivership has verified that all accounts being \ncollected by the law firm have been forgiven by the credit card company (App. Ex. E, \nLetter, dated October 15, 2008).    \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.d is for a charged off debt to a bank for $6,016.  \nApplicant's wife paid this account in full and Applicant, as an authorized user on the \naccount, no longer has responsibility for the account and debt (Tr. 18, App. Ex. D, \nLetter, dated October 20, 2008; App. Ex. J, Check, dated April 25, 2008).  \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.e is an account for a department store.  Applicant claims \nhis wife paid the account but there is no documentation to show payment.  Applicant \ncontacted the department store and was informed that the account was sold and \ncharged off for so long there is no reason to try to pay the account (Tr.  21-22). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.f is a bank loan in collection for $943.  Applicant paid this \naccount in full (Tr. 19; App. Ex. F, Letter, dated October 22, 2008).  \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.g is a bank loan for a car charged off for $14,135.  \nApplicant settled this account for $7,000 and paid the account (Tr. 17; App. Ex. C, \nLetter, dated January 22, 2009). \n \nSince leaving active duty with the Army, Applicant has had three children, \ngraduated from college, purchased a house, is employed, and meets his financial \nobligations.  His company rates his performance as above average to outstanding.  \nApplicant and his wife used the extra money he made while stationed in Iraq and his tax \nrefund to pay their debts in early 2008.  He has over $4,500 in cash in his house to use \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfor contingencies (Tr. 34-36, 43-47; App. Ex. I, Evaluation, dated February 2, 2009).  \nApplicant and his wife do have student loans to pay but they are current on these loans \n(Tr. 29-30). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  The delinquent debts on the credit report are a security concern raising \nFinancial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) \"inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\", and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) \"a history of not meeting financial \nobligations\".   \n \n \nApplicant raised mitigating circumstances for his debts by his testimony.  I \nconsidered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) \"the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\" and find it has some application.  \nSix of the seven debts listed in the SOR have been paid or resolved.  Four of the debts \nwere paid at least a year ago and are not current debts.  Two of the debts were paid or \nforgiven within the last six months.  The remaining debt is being paid under a payment \nplan.  He used extra money earned in Iraq and his tax refund to pay his debts.  \nApplicant took measures to resolve his debts and his financial problems should not \nrecur.  His present financial situation does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\"  Applicant did not list any \nconditions that were beyond his control that caused his financial problems.  However, \nhe did act responsibly towards his debts under the circumstances by using the extra \nfunds earned for serving in a combat zone and his tax return to pay most of his past due \nobligations.   \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(c) \"the person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nunder control\" does not fully applies.  There are some indications Applicant received \nfinancial counseling since he indicated he employed a credit service company to help \nhim pay his debts.  He did not provide additional information concerning any counseling \nthe company provided him.  However, his financial problems are being resolved and are \nunder control meeting this prong of the mitigating condition.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\" partially applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is \nneeded.  Applicant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a strong desire to pay \nthem, and has shown a good-faith effort to pay them.  Applicant paid or resolved six of \nthe seven delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  While he did not have complete \ndocumentation of payment of all of the debts, he made a concerted effort to obtain the \ndocuments, but could not because of the lack of records or response from the collection \nagencies.  His statement that debts have been paid where no documentation could \nverify the payment is credible.  The one remaining debt is being paid under a payment \nplan and Applicant provided documentation of payment under the plan.  Applicant has \nnot incurred additional delinquent debts and is paying his student loans as agreed.  \nApplicant acted responsibly towards his debts, and established his good-faith efforts to \nresolve his debts.  He mitigated security concerns for his financial situation. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant's five years \n\n \n7 \n \n \nof active duty in the Army and the upgrade of his discharge to General under Honorable \nConditions.  Applicant lives within his means and meets his present personal financial \nobligations including his student loans.  He paid or resolved his past due obligations \nexcept for one debt that is being paid under a payment plan.  His actions do not indicate \npoor self control, lack of judgment or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.  \nHe is not financially overextended, and his finances do not create a security concern.  \nOverall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on June 11, 2007. On April 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its decision to deny him a\nsecurity clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 12, 2008. He answered the\nSOR on May 14, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing. On August 5, 2008,\nthe government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of seven\nexhibits (Items 1-7). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed\nNovember 28, 2008\n\n2\nhim to respond within 30 days of receipt. No response was received by the September\n12, 2008, due date. On October 23, 2008, the case was assigned to me to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. Based upon a review of the government\u2019s FORM, including\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 4), eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\nfive delinquent debts totaling $24,139 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e). Applicant admitted the\nindebtedness alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e. He denied the other debts because they\ndid not appear on his credit report as of May 12, 2008. After considering the evidence of\nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 30-year-old remedy administrator, who has worked for his present\nemployer, a defense contractor, since about May 2007. He does not hold a security\nclearance (Item 5).\nFrom about June 1997 to June 2000, Applicant pursued his bachelor\u2019s degree in\nbusiness administration. He financed his education in part through student loans. In\n1998, he took out four separate loans totaling $14,667. The loans were in deferral\nwhen they were transferred in May 2000 with a balance of $14,742 (Items 4, 7).\nApplicant also worked while he was in college, as a help desk technician for a local firm\nfrom July 1998 to June 2000 (Item 5). His annual taxed earnings were $6,179 for 1998,\n$26,384 for 1999, and $17,531 for the first half of 2000 (Item 4).\nOn earning his B.A. degree in June 2000, Applicant relocated to start his own\nbusiness in the field of oil and gas exploration. He earned no taxable income for tax\nyears 2001 or 2002 as he struggled to establish the business. He was supported by his\nparents (Item 4), but struggled financially and fell seriously behind in some obligations\nincurred before he became self-employed. Those debts are as follows:\n!\nA gasoline credit card account opened in April 1997 was placed for collection in\nor about March 2001. The purchaser of the account (SOR \u00b6 1.c) reported a\ndelinquent balance of $5,454 as of May 2007 with no activity since March 2001\n(Item 7).\n!\nA charge account with a clothing retailer, opened in August 1998, was charged\noff with a balance due of $543 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) (Items 6, 7).\n!\nA credit card account opened in November 1999 was charged off in or before\nApril 2001. The account (SOR \u00b6 1.e) had a reported high balance of $7,276\n(Items 6, 7). Available credit records report a zero balance on transfer, but\nApplicant was held liable for a delinquent balance in collection as of May 2008\n(Item 4).\n\nThis employment is not listed on his e-QIP (Item 5), but his social security earnings statement shows\n1\nhe earned $5,104 in 2003.\n3\n!\nIn January 2000, Applicant leased an automobile to be repaid at $438 monthly\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a). He defaulted and the car was repossessed. A $10,115 delinquent\nbalance was charged off to profit and loss in or about September 2001 (Items 4,\n6, 7).\n!\nApplicant\u2019s credit report of July 7, 2007 (Item 7), also showed that he owed an\nAmerican Express debt of $751 on an account that had no activity since March\n2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.d).\nIn August 2002, Applicant and his spouse married (Items 4, 5). He stopped\naccepting financial support from his parents, and was supported by his spouse. While\nlooking for a full-time job, he continued to work on his business when he had time. In\nlate 2003, he started a job paying $9.00 an hour.  His income for 2003 was only $5,104,\n1\nand insufficient to pay any of his delinquent debts (Item 4). Applicant and his spouse\nincurred additional credit card debt to cover necessary expenses that arose. He was\nlisted as an authorized user on credit card accounts opened in March 2003 and\nSeptember 2004. High credit on the first account reached $4,500. As of June 2007, that\naccount had a balance of $4,179. High credit on the second account reached $3,568,\n$68 over the credit limit, but the debt had been paid down to $49 as of May 2007. In\nFebruary 2006, Applicant opened a couple of credit card accounts that had respective\ncredit limits of $1,250 and $400. Payments were made according to terms on these\naccounts, but he made no payments on his old debts (Items 6, 7).\nEmployed full-time from October 2004 to August 2006 as a business analyst for a\nlocal firm while continuing to operate his own business, Applicant had earned income of\n$26,599 for 2004 and $29,061 for 2005. He earned $26,117 in 2006. His only\nemployment after August of that year was his business (Items 4, 5). The evidentiary\nrecord contains no information about his spouse\u2019s earnings during those years.\nIn May 2007, Applicant began working as a \u201cremedy administrator\u201d for a defense\ncontractor. On June 1, 2007, Applicant took out a 30-year conventional real estate loan\nof $147,090 to be repaid at $1,189 monthly (Item 6). He took out a credit card with the\nsame bank as well. The account had a $1,000 credit limit (Item 6). On June 11, 2007,\nhe completed an e-QIP on which he disclosed the five debts listed in the SOR and\nexplained that the accounts went delinquent when he became self-employed (Item 5). In\nOctober 2007, he opened a revolving credit card account with a credit limit of $750. In\nJanuary 2008, he opened yet another credit card account with high credit of $300 (Item\n6). His annual earnings for 2007 were $31,264 (Item 4).\nOn March 17, 2008, Applicant responded to inquiries from DOHA about the\ndelinquent accounts. He attributed his debt to no income for about 18 months, and\ninsufficient income when he was gainfully employed. Concerning his financial status,\n\nThe personal financial statement is dated June 17, 2008. However, it is included in Applicant\u2019s\n2\nresponse to interrogatories dated March 17, 2008. All of the other documents included in Item 6 bear dates\non or before March 17.\n4\nApplicant provided a credit report showing a record of timely payment of the credit card\nobligations incurred in the past four years. The aggregate balance on the six open credit\ncard accounts was $4,448. He also furnished a personal financial statement  on which\n2\nhe estimated a net monthly deficit of $419.76 after payment of monthly expenses, his\nopen credit cards, and his mortgage. His spouse\u2019s net salary was only $100, so he was\nthe sole provider for the household. His old debts were not a priority since they were\nbeing written off and he did not have the income to make any payments on them  (Item\n6).\nFollowing receipt of the SOR, Applicant obtained a credit report \u201cto validate the\nclaims made in the Statement of Reasons.\u201d Applicant contacted two creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a and 1.e) because they were still reporting the delinquencies on his credit record as\nof May 12, 2008. The car lessor (SOR \u00b6 1.a) required a down payment of $2,023.10\nbefore he could make monthly payments, which Applicant told him he could not afford\nbut that he would \u201cbegin to work toward saving up this amount in order to begin a\nrepayment schedule.\u201d The collection assignee for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e offered to settle\nfor an amount that Applicant could pay. Applicant maintains he paid it off but he\nprovided only a contact number to call for verification (Item 4). As for the debts in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d, Applicant indicated he would work with the creditors to settle them\nif DOHA could \u201cfind any current evidence of these debts.\u201d (Item 6).\nAs of April 2008, Applicant had a student loan balance of $26,456. His student\nloan was still in deferred status. His six open credit card accounts remained current and\nhad an aggregate balance of about $4,754, $1,666 of which was owed on the revolving\ncharge opened in September 2004 with Applicant as an authorized user (Item 4).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nAfter he graduated from college in June 2000, Applicant struggled financially as\nhe attempted to establish his own oil and gas exploration business. He stopped paying\non the accounts in the SOR, and they became seriously delinquent in 2001. Supported\nby his parents, and after August 2002 by his spouse, Applicant made no payments on\nbad debt that totaled about $24,139. He began working full-time in October 2004, and in\n\n6\nFebruary 2006 opened two new credit card accounts. In early June 2007, he and his\nspouse took out a mortgage loan and he opened a credit card account with the bank. As\nhe acknowledged on his e-QIP, the debts in the SOR went unpaid. Three of the debts\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d) no longer appear on his credit record, but that does not\nrelieve him of his legal and/or ethical responsibility to resolve them. Significant security\nconcerns are raised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)). \nAs of about March 2008, Applicant reported a net monthly deficit of $419 after\npaying his mortgage, expenses, and a bit more than the monthly minimum on the credit\ncard debts incurred since 2004.  A significant negative cash flow can be an indicator of\nspending beyond one\u2019s means (see AG \u00b6 19(e) (\u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash\nflow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis\u201d)). Although there is no\nindication of lavish expenditure, and Applicant is presently paying his current obligations\nas required by his creditors, he appears to be seriously overextended. In the absence of\nany evidence of additional income from employment or other sources, it must be\nconsidered that Applicant is borrowing from one creditor to pay another. As of May\n2008, his outstanding credit card balances totaled $4,754. Mitigating condition AG \u00b6\n20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does not apply to ongoing\nfinancial problems.\nAG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies to some extent. In retrospect,\nApplicant perhaps should not have attempted to start his own business lacking the\ncapital and experience to ensure a profitable enterprise. Yet, he likely did not anticipate\nthat it would bring him no income, or that he would have difficulty finding a good paying\njob once he was married and no longer relied on his parents for financial support. His\nrecord of social security and medicare earnings shows he earned nothing in 2001 and\n2002, and only $5,104 in 2003. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully mitigate his inaction on his old\ndebts after he started working full-time in 2004, however. Applicant understandably\nneeded some time to get his finances in order. He earned income of $29,061 in 2005\nand $26,117 in 2006. While not enough to pay off his old debts in full, he certainly could\nhave contacted his creditors earlier and attempted to settle with them. Knowing that he\nhad done nothing to resolve them, he and his spouse put their personal interests ahead\nof his obligation to his creditors.  They bought a home in early June 2007, taking out a\nmortgage loan of $147,090. It is unclear where they obtained the funds for a down\npayment, if any, or whether his spouse was contributing appreciably to the household\nincome. Only ten days later, he filled out his SF 86 disclosing the debts listed in the\nSOR. A personal financial statement dated June 17, 2008, suggested significant\ndifficulty making ends meet.\n\n7\nApplicant was candid with the government about his debts, even admitting in\nresponse to interrogatories in March 2008 that he had to incur additional debt over the\nyears, and that his old debts were not a priority for him. He is not regarded as\nvulnerable to blackmail or coercion because of those debts known to the government.\nBut the government must be assured that his financial situation is sufficiently stable to\npose little security risk. In May 2008, he contacted two of the creditors listed in the SOR.\nHe lacks the funds needed to commence repayment of the car debt. While his overall\ncandor about his finances leads me to accept his claim that he settled the debt in SOR\n\u00b6 1.e for less than the full amount, it is not enough to satisfy AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) or AG\n\u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d). Applicant\nwas put on notice in the FORM that the government was concerned about his reported\nnegative cash flow situation and he presented nothing in rebuttal.\nApplicant has made no efforts to contact the other three creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b,\n1.c, and 1.d) to whom he owes an aggregate balance of $6,748. While he now claims\nhe would be happy to work with the creditors should DOHA find any current evidence of\nthem, he had previously listed them as delinquent obligations on his SF 86.  Under the\ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 20 (\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy\nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof\nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue\u201d) does not apply.  \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct\nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant made no effort to address his delinquent debt until May 2008, after the\nSOR was issued.  He contacted only two of his five creditors in the SOR, based on the\n\n8\nother three having been dropped from his credit report. Although he apparently settled\nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, his financial situation remains tenuous. He owes a substantial\namount of current credit card debt on which he is running a balance every month. In\naddition, at some point he will have to begin repaying about $26,456 in student loan\ndebt. Based on the financial information of record, it is not at all evident that he will be\nable to make his payments. Ongoing concerns persist about Applicant\u2019s handling of his\nfinancial affairs, despite his timely payments of his mortgage and the open credit card\ndebt.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In the SOR as amended, DOHA alleged under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) that Applicant owes a former employer (company X) a past due debt of $18,176 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a military housing debt of $865 in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and seven delinquent consumer credit debts totaling $3,012 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.i). Applicant was alleged under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) to have been fired from his employment with company X for substandard performance and for creating a hostile work environment (SOR \u00b6 2.a). He was also alleged to have had his security clearance suspended by his command in May 2006 while he was on active duty in the U.S. military after he was charged with possession of marijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.b). In his Answer, Applicant admitted owing the debt balances in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, and 1.g, $25 on the account in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and $638.61 on the account in SOR \u00b6 1.f.

He denied SOR \u00b6 1.h because the creditor could not confirm a second debt balance in addition to SOR \u00b6 1.f (duplicate listing).

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on August 24, 2007. On September 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed\nthe security concerns under Guideline F and Guideline E that provided the basis for its\ndecision to deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative\njudge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 13, 2008. He submitted\nan undated written response to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. The case\nwas assigned to me on November 17, 2008, to conduct a hearing and to determine\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nMarch 23, 2009\n\n2\nclearance for Applicant. On November 21, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for December\n18, 2008.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. The government offered six exhibits (Ex. 1-\n6). Exhibits 1-5 were admitted without any objections. Applicant objected to proposed\nexhibit 6, a Letter of Intent to Revoke Eligibility for Security Clearance, and related\ndocuments. I sustained the objection. Three Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-C) were admitted\nwith no objections. A chart prepared by Department Counsel as an aid to his closing\nargument was accepted as a hearing exhibit (H. Ex. 1). Applicant and three witnesses\ntestified on his behalf, as reflected in a transcript received on December 31, 2008.\nDuring his closing argument, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 2.b to reflect\nthat Applicant\u2019s clearance had been suspended as opposed to revoked. Applicant did\nnot object and I granted the motion.\nI held the record open until January 17, 2009, for Applicant to submit additional\ndocumentary exhibits. No documents were received. Based on a review of the SOR,\nAnswer, transcript, and documentary exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR as amended, DOHA alleged under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) that Applicant owes a former employer (company X) a past due debt of\n$18,176 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a military housing debt of $865 in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and\nseven delinquent consumer credit debts totaling $3,012 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.i). Applicant was\nalleged under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) to have been fired from his employment\nwith company X for substandard performance and for creating a hostile work\nenvironment (SOR \u00b6 2.a). He was also alleged to have had his security clearance\nsuspended by his command in May 2006 while he was on active duty in the U.S.\nmilitary after he was charged with possession of marijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.b).\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted owing the debt balances in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d,\nand 1.g, $25 on the account in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and $638.61 on the account in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He\nindicated he had arranged to pay off the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e in November 2008, and to\nmake monthly payments of $20 per month on his other debts (with his payments on\nSOR \u00b6 1.a to increase over time). He denied SOR \u00b6 1.h because the creditor could not\nconfirm a second debt balance in addition to SOR \u00b6 1.f (duplicate listing). He also\ndenied SOR \u00b6 1.i as that creditor had no record of a past due balance. Concerning the\nGuideline E allegations, Applicant explained that he had been involuntarily terminated\nfrom company X as mandated under corporate policy for a second violation, but he\ncontended \u201c[t]he first offence was a false harassment report.\u201d Regarding the suspension\nof his security clearance, Applicant admitted he had formerly associated with drug-using\nfriends through his spouse, who he has since divorced. To the best of his knowledge,\nnone of his current associates use illegal drugs.\nAfter considering the pleadings and evidence of record, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\n\nApplicant indicated on his August 24, 2007, e-QIP that he was apprehended in February 2005 and\n1\nthat his clearance was suspended as a result in April 2005 (Ex. 1). The incident took place in 2006 (Exs. 2,\n5, Tr. 34).\n3\nApplicant is a 31-year-old engineer technician who has worked for his current\nemployer, a defense contractor, since February 2008 (Ex. C, Tr. 52-53). He requires a\nsecret-level security clearance for access to certain areas to perform his duties (Tr. 66).\nThe day after he turned 18, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. military, and in\nSeptember 1996, he entered active duty (Ex. 2). He was granted a secret clearance for\nhis duties in or about December 1996. In January 1999, Applicant married. His spouse\n(now ex-wife) had a son born in May 1993 from a previous relationship. In September\n1999, Applicant and his spouse had a daughter. (Ex. 1)\nFrom March 1999 to July 2006, Applicant and his family lived in military housing,\ninitially in his current geographic area (state A). From September 2001 to November\n2003, they lived in Hawaii where Applicant was assigned to a boat home-ported there.\nIn December 2003, they moved back to state A where Applicant remained stationed\nuntil he left the military (Ex. 1).\nIn January 2006, Applicant lent his vehicle to his spouse\u2019s friend, who was\nhelping them move her mother across town. This friend took a break to smoke\nmarijuana, and placed stems and seeds in the ashtray of Applicant\u2019s vehicle. A month\nlater, Applicant was pulled over for a random vehicle inspection on entering the military\nbase. He was charged with two counts of wrongful use, possession, etc. of controlled\nsubstances in violation of Article 112.a of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,  after the\n1\nmarijuana residue was discovered. Applicant apparently continued to associate with the\nperson who put the marijuana in his vehicle thereafter in an effort to clear his name (Tr.\n30-31). The command suspended Applicant\u2019s security clearance in May 2006 after he\nwas placed on report for possession of illegal drugs (Ex. 5). The charges were dropped\nat an Executive Officer\u2019s inquiry during which Applicant presented a statement from his\nspouse\u2019s friend confirming he had placed the marijuana residue in the ashtray without\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge or consent (Ex. 2). The Executive Officer declined to apply for\nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance because of his questionable judgment in\nassociating with drug users (SOR \u00b6 2.b) (Tr. 35-36). In July 2006, Applicant was\ngranted an honorable discharge with reduction in force being the reason for the\nseparation (Ex. 2).\nWhen Applicant separated from the military, he owed some costs for military\nhousing and for cleaning the premises after he vacated. In January 2007, a delinquent\nbalance of $865 was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b) (Ex. 4, Tr. 42-43). In July 2006,\nApplicant stopped paying on a credit account opened in October 1997 with a home\nfurnishings/electronics retailer. A $953 balance was charged off as of February 2007\n(SOR \u00b6 1.g) (Exs. 2, 3). An unpaid balance of $90 owed to a cable television provider\nsince February 2006 was placed for collection in November 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) (Exs. 3,\n4).\n\nApplicant testified that he was on track to earn $100,000 in his previous job. His hourly wage was\n2\nonly $24 but he worked a lot of overtime (Tr. 55).\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h appear to be the same debt based on the account numbers, with an updated\n3\nbalance of $638.61 rather than $305 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f or $570 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h.  \n4\nIn July 2006, Applicant went to work as an equipment technician in the civilian\nsector in state B (Ex. 1). He accepted a substantial relocation allowance (about\n$16,000) from his new employer (company X) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) with the understanding that if\nhe did not stay with the company for two years, he would have to repay the monies (Tr.\n31-32, 41). Applicant\u2019s spouse got a job with company X as well, and she developed a\nfriendship with a coworker whose husband also worked for the company. The couples\nsocialized together (Tr. 37). In March 2007, Applicant was involuntarily terminated from\nhis employment following two incidents (Ex. 1, Tr. 37). His spouse and her coworker\nhad a \u201cfalling-out.\u201d Thereafter, as Applicant passed his spouse\u2019s coworker in the\nhallways, he made what he terms \u201cfriendly eye contact\u201d with this coworker in an effort to\nkeep their friendship going (Tr. 37-38). She interpreted the gestures as harassing and\nintimidating, and complained to their employer (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Then in an unrelated\nincident, a female coworker accused him of lying and falsifying equipment records.\nApplicant responded in a rude manner with an obscene gesture (Tr. 38). In March 2007,\nhe was fired for substandard performance and creating a hostile work environment\n(being a disruptive member to the team) (Tr. 39).\nApplicant was without a job until June 2007, when he started working as an\nelectronic technician for a defense contractor at $18 an hour (Tr. 55). This meant a\nrelocation from state B back to state A (Ex. 1). He took a \u201chuge pay cut\u201d from what he\nhad earned at company X,  and had trouble paying his cellular phone bill, or his electric\n2\nbill from his previous locale. In February 2007, a cellular phone provider had placed a\n$102 debt balance for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e). After making a payment in March 2007,\nhe still owed $18 (Ex. 2), and that went unpaid. As of October 2008, the balance of the\ndebt was $25 (Answer, Tr. 43). In August 2007, a credit card lender charged off a\ndelinquent balance on an account opened since February 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). As of\nOctober 2008, the unpaid balance was $638.61.  A $288 delinquent debt was placed for\n3\ncollection by his former utility provider in April 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) (Exs. 2, 3). He also\nmade no effort to repay the military housing debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) or the relocation costs\npaid on his behalf by company X (SOR \u00b6 1.a). As of December 2008, the debt to\ncompany X had increased to about $18,176 (Answer).\nOn August 24, 2007, Applicant executed an e-QIP on which he disclosed his\ntermination from company X, the drug possession charge in the military which was\ndropped, and the suspension of his security clearance by the military command as a\nresult of the charge. Concerning his financial record, he indicated that he owed about\n$16,000 to company X for relocation assistance, and that he had been past due on\nother accounts in the past (Ex. 1). While his clearance was pending, Applicant was laid\noff by his employer in November 2007 (Tr. 53).\n\n5\nIn February 2008, Applicant began working for his current employer at an hourly\nwage of $18.26 (Ex. 52-53). At DOHA\u2019s request, Applicant completed a personal\nfinancial statement on or about March 24, 2008. He reported a net monthly remainder of\n$122.20 after paying monthly expenses and nothing on his debts. He also denied any\nongoing association with known illicit drug users (Ex. 2).\nIn July 2008, Applicant and his spouse divorced (Answer, Tr. 36). He has\n\u201creasonable visitation\u201d with his daughter, who lives in state B with his ex-wife (Tr. 50).\nHe was ordered to pay child support and alimony of $230 a week (Tr. 45, 54) and $50 a\nweek to assist with day care costs (Tr. 47). To supplement his income, Applicant started\nworking a second job as a security guard (Tr. 46).\nIn about October 2008, Applicant contacted his creditors to make payment\narrangements. He arranged to make payments of $20 per month on each of the debts in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g, with his payment amount to increase over time on the debt in SOR \u00b6\n1.a, and to settle the $25 balance of his wireless phone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) in November\n2008. In October 2008, Applicant\u2019s roommate ran up $600 in telephone charges on\nApplicant\u2019s account. Applicant paid the telephone bill so he could keep in contact with\nhis ex-wife and children (Tr. 45), and he was unable to honor the payment\narrangements on his old debts. Applicant moved in with a friend of his from the military.\nDue to other financial obligations, Applicant had yet to pay his full $570 monthly\nobligation (shares of rent and Internet costs) to his current roommate. He paid about a\n\u201ccouple hundred\u201d each month but also covered some of the food costs (Tr. 80-81).\nOn December 10, 2008, Applicant learned that his offer to pay $20 per month on\nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is no longer acceptable to company X (Ex. A, Tr. 29, 53).\nSimilarly, the utility owed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is no longer amenable to $20 monthly\npayments (Ex. A, Tr. 29). The creditors owed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.g have\naccepted the $20 per month repayment term (Tr. 29). Applicant arranged for the first\n$20 checks to be posted on January 16, 2009, to the assignee of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g,\nand on January 23, 2009, to the assignee of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He plans to pay the\n$25 wireless phone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) in January 2009 as well (Ex. A, Tr. 42-43).\nApplicant\u2019s weekly take-home pay from both jobs totals $615. His monthly\nexpenses total between $2,160 and $2,210 ($80 for car insurance, $150 to $200 for\ncellular phone service for himself, his nine-year-old daughter, and his 15-year-old\nstepson, $70 for cable/Internet, $500 for rent and utilities, $200 for groceries, $40 for\ngasoline) (Tr. 46-49). He has about $17 in his checking account and nothing in savings\n(Tr. 49). He does not have any active credit card accounts (Tr. 49). Applicant has not\nhad any contact with any known drug users since 2006 (Tr. 31).\nApplicant\u2019s current manager has been professionally acquainted with Applicant\nfor the past five or six years, since Applicant was in the military. Applicant was \u201ca good\nconscientious counterpart\u201d when served as this manager\u2019s contact or liaison with the\nmilitary. He has rated Applicant\u2019s performance as satisfactory since coming to work for\nthe company in a civilian capacity (\u201cHe comes to work. He does his job. That\u2019s an\naverage employee.\u201d) (Tr. 59-61). In terms of professionalism and judgment, he\n\n6\nconsiders Applicant to be \u201coutstanding,\u201d better than most of his coworkers (Tr. 62).\nApplicant\u2019s facility security officer has also found him to be professional and courteous\nat work (Tr. 70). An engineering technician familiar with Applicant\u2019s work since February\n2008 described Applicant\u2019s character at work as \u201cstable and mature\u201d (Ex. B). Likewise,\nan engineer has observed Applicant\u2019s progression to becoming a \u201cvaluable and reliable\nemployee\u201d (Ex. C).  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\n\nEquifax was also reporting as of March 21, 2008, an additional debt of $232 owed the creditor in SOR\n4\n\u00b6 1.e on a second account (Ex. 2), but the basis for that debt listing was not explored at the hearing. \n7\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18 of the adjudicative\nguidelines:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe evidence establishes that Applicant owes unpaid delinquent debt totaling\nabout $21,035.61 of the debt originally alleged in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f and 1.g).4\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h appear to be the same debt based on the account numbers, with an\nupdated balance of $638.61 rather than $305 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f or $570 as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h.  Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.\nMoreover, AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfinancial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism,\ngambling problems, or other issues of security concern,\u201d is implicated as well. As a\nconsequence of his involuntary termination from company X for, in part, creating a\nhostile work environment (see Guideline E, infra), Applicant has to repay his former\nemployer for the relocation costs expended on his behalf (SOR \u00b6 1.a). This debt\nobligation to his former employer is of primary concern, given the financial pressures\ncaused by the amount of the debt ($18,176) and the company\u2019s unwillingness to accept\nthe repayment terms proposed by Applicant.\nWhile a September 28, 2007, consolidated credit report listed a $704 debt\nbalance placed for collection by a telephone services provider in February 2004 (SOR \u00b6\n1.i) (Ex. 4), Applicant denied the debt, apparently based on the creditor\u2019s inability to\nconfirm it (Answer), and there is no mention of that debt on the September 2007 or\nSeptember 2008 (Ex. 3) credit reports. The evidence is not sufficient to establish the\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.i (see AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue\u201d).\nConcerning the potentially mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply. Available credit records show that\nhis accounts became delinquent in the past few years, and they have not been paid. \n\n8\n \nApplicant attributes the $638 credit card delinquency (SOR \u00b6 1.f/1.h) to his\nunemployment in March 2007, and the $288 utility debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c to a significant\ndecrease in pay once he returned to work. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not\nextenuate delinquencies that can be traced to his own behavior. Even if I accept his\ndenials of any intentional harassment, he does not deny that he made an obscene\ngesture to a female coworker. His unemployment was a direct consequence of his\nfailure to conform his behavior to acceptable standards of the workplace. However, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) applies in part, in that his divorce and the obligations of alimony and child\nsupport have strained his finances and impaired his ability to repay his delinquent debt.\nAfter the SOR was issued, Applicant contacted his creditors and offered to make\n$20 monthly payments until the debts are satisfied. He took on a second job for the\nincome to make those payments. While these are credible first steps toward resolving\nhis debts, I am unable to fully apply either AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d or AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d He had not made any\npayments to his creditors as of mid-December 2008, because he had to pay\nunexpected telephone costs of $600 incurred by a former roommate. Regardless of\nability or willingness, he failed to satisfy even the most minor of his debts (SOR \u00b6 1.e).\nApplicant testified that he arranged for $20 payments to be made electronically in\nJanuary 2009 to the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g. The record was held open for four\nweeks so that he could submit proof of those payments, as well as satisfaction of the\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. To date, no documentation has been received. Company X and the\nutility company are no longer willing to accept his offer of repayment at $20 per month,\nand even with a second job, he does not have the finances to pay the full amount of his\nrental obligation. With a reported $17 in his checking account, and zero savings, his\nfinancial problems are unlikely to be resolved in the near future.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, \u00b6 15 of the\nadjudicative guidelines:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant exhibited poor judgment within the context of AG \u00b6 15 by knowingly\nassociating with drug users while he held a security clearance as a member of the U.S.\nmilitary. The record is not clear about the extent of his contacts with known drug users.\n\n9\nA high school friend of his ex-wife\u2019s left marijuana residue (stems and seeds) in\nApplicant\u2019s vehicle in January 2006, and it was discovered during a search of\nApplicant\u2019s car on a U.S. military base in February 2006. The evidence does not show\nthat Applicant knew the marijuana was in his vehicle, but he also testified as follows:\nAs for my continued association with users of illegal drugs. Those were\nold high school friends of my ex-wife\u2019s. We had no reason to believe they\nwere still using marijuana at that time. The only reason that we were still\u2013I\nwas still in contact with these people was to try and figure out exactly how\nthe remnants got into my car, so that I could not have to worry about it still\nbeing mine, so to speak. (Tr. 30-31)\nHe argued in closing that he had not known that his ex-wife\u2019s friends were drug users,\nbut explained that he continued to associate with them \u201cto clear [his] own name within\n[his] command\u201d (Tr. 92). In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant admitted he\nhad been in situations where he had been offered illegal drugs (\u201cI told the people\noffering that I would wait for them to be done in a different location.\u201d Ex. 2). He was not\nspecific about the time frame, but his statement has to be read in context with his\nnegative response to whether he associates with persons who use illegal drugs or\nfrequents places where he has reason to believe drugs are being used. Apparently, he\nwas referring to situations in the past where he was offered marijuana and not to any\nongoing association with drug users as of March 2008.\nJudgment concerns are raised by his inappropriate conduct in the workplace that\nled to his involuntary termination in March 2007. Applicant denies any validity to the\ncharge of harassment, claiming that he made \u201cfriendly eye contact\u201d with the female\ncoworker in an effort to keep the friendship between them. Yet, his employer did not\nconsider the claims of intimidation baseless. As for the second incident, Applicant does\nnot deny that he made an obscene gesture to a female coworker. AG \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible\nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not\nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to consideration of: . . .\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace\u201d applies. \nApplicant disclosed his job termination from company X and the suspension of\nhis security clearance following the drug charge when he applied for his secret\nclearance in August 2007 for his duties with a previous employer. This candor does not\nexcuse his previous poor judgment, but it does lead me to accept as credible his denials\nof any knowing associations with drug abusers since 2006, especially where there is no\nevidence to the contrary. AG \u00b6 17(g), \u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal\nactivity has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and\nregulations\u201d applies.\n\n10\nAs for mitigation of his inappropriate behavior at the workplace, several\ncoworkers, including supervisory personnel, attest to Applicant\u2019s professional demeanor\nin his current job. Yet, Applicant\u2019s denials of any harassment of his former coworker are\ndifficult to reconcile with his employment termination from company X. AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d applies only in part.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be\nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines\nand the whole-person concept (see AG \u00b6 2(c)).\nApplicant continued to associate with at least one known drug user while he was\nfacing possible nonjudicial punishment in the spring of 2006. This poor judgment was\ninconsistent with the obligations of his military service and his security clearance, but he\nwas granted an honorable discharge, and he has not had any contacts with drug\nabusers since 2006. Similarly, there apparently has been no recurrence of the\ninappropriate behavior that led to his involuntary termination in March 2007. His current\ncoworkers all attest to his professionalism on the job.  But he has not fully mitigated the\njudgment concerns raised by the loss of his job at company X for reasons unrelated to\nhis work performance. He continues to maintain that all he did in the first instance was\nmake eye contact. After being given an opportunity to explain his version of events,\ncompany X considered it \u201cstrike one\u201d against him (Tr. 38-39). He acknowledged that he\nmade an obscene gesture in the second instance, for which he apologized (Tr. 38), but\nhe initially rationalized his conduct in describing it as a misunderstanding (\u201cBoth\nincidents at [company X] were misunderstandings that I did cause. But, they have been\nworked out. The incident that ended up with my termination, I still converse friendly with\nthe person that that happened to.\u201d Tr. 31).\nNor has Applicant fully mitigated the financial concerns. Applicant knew as of\nMarch 2007 that he would have to repay the sizable relocation allowance to company X.\n\n11\nHe made no effort to contact any of his creditors until October 2008, and had made no\npayments as of December 2008. Two of his creditors, including company X, are not\nwilling to accept only $20 per month, and he is so stretched financially that he cannot\nafford to pay his full share of the rent. His financial problems are not likely to be\nresolved in the near future.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:\n(Duplicate of \u00b6 1.f)\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On July 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 28, 2008, DOHA received Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed on September 29, 2008. The case was assigned to me on October 8, 2008. On \nOctober 14, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for October \n31, 2008. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered ten exhibits which \nwere admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 10. The Applicant testified. The record \nwas held open until November 14, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit additional \nDecember 4, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \ndocuments. No documents were offered. The transcript was received on November 13, \n2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nThe Notice of Hearing was sent out less than fifteen days prior to the hearing. \nApplicant waived the fifteen day notice requirement. (Tr at 6.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, \n1.x, 1.aa, and 1.bb, but denies all remaining allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.

He and his wife separated a few weeks prior to the \nhearing. (Tr at 4, 6-8, 59; Gov 1; Gov 2.)  \n \nOn March 15, 2007, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust \nPosition (SF 85P) in relation to his job with a previous employer. He answered, \u201cNo,\u201d in \nresponse to question \u201c22(a) Your Financial Record. In the last 7 years, have you or a \ncompany over which you exercised some control, filed for bankruptcy, been declared \nbankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had legal judgment rendered against you for a \ndebt?\u201d He also answered, \u201cNo,\u201d in response to question \u201c22(b) Your Financial Record. \nAre you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?

He completed an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing, (e-QIP) on September 6, 2007 \nin order to apply for a security clearance. He answered \u201cYes\u201d in response to question \n28(a) \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d He \nlisted a $1,200 debt related to a truck repossession in December 2006. He could not \nafford the payments so he surrendered the truck back to the company. He answered \n\u201cNo\u201d in response to question 28(b) \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)?\u201d (Gov 2.)  \n \nA subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant filed for \nbankruptcy under Chapter 7 on July 31, 1998. His debts were discharged on November \n25, 1998. (Gov 4; Gov 10 at 3.) Applicant filed for bankruptcy in 1998 because of issues \nwith a truck that he purchased in 1996 for $27,000.  The truck had an extended \nwarranty. In 1998, the truck had mechanical problems. The warranty company would \nnot pay to the fix the truck. Applicant could not afford to make the loan payments and \npay for the vehicle repairs, so he allowed the truck to be repossessed. He owed \n\n \n3 \n \n \napproximately $17,000 on the loan for the truck. He filed for bankruptcy in order to clear \nup this account. Approximately $20,000 was discharged in his bankruptcy. (Tr at 51-54.)   \n \nIn August 2001, Applicant was charged with Deposit Account Fraud related to \nthree bad checks written to a convenience store. The charges were dismissed in \nSeptember 2001 after costs and restitution were paid. (Gov 5 at 3-4.) Applicant was \ncharged with Deposit Account Fraud in July 2001 and August 2001 related to three bad \nchecks written to a grocery store. The charges were dismissed in September 2001 after \ncosts and restitution were paid. (Gov 5 at 2, 5, 6.)  \n \nIn March, May, August \u2013 November 2000, Applicant was taken to court for failure \nto pay monthly rent on his mobile home lot. In February \u2013 July 2001 and September \n2001, he was taken to court for failure to pay monthly rent. He paid the rent after a \njudgment was entered.  The debts are resolved. (Gov 6; Gov 10 at 3.) \n \nOn August 10, 2007, a $2,449 judgment was entered against Applicant on behalf \nof a credit company for a deficiency balance on an automobile loan. On December 14, \n2007, a garnishment was filed against Applicant. On May 19, 2008, the judgment was \nsatisfied through wage garnishment. Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished $300 each pay \ncheck or $600 a month. (Gov 7; Gov 8 at 3; Gov 9 at 12.) \n \nApplicant owes the following  delinquent accounts:  a $416 cell phone account \nplaced for collection in February 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 8 at 1; Gov 10 at 4); a $194 cell \nphone account placed for collection in November 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 10 at 8); a \n$625 credit card account placed for collection in March 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 8 at 2; \nGov 9 at 8; Gov 10 at 4); a $903 furniture rental account placed for collection in \nFebruary 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 9 at 4; Gov 10 at 4); a $412 utility account \nplaced for collection in June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 8 at 3); and a $1,145 account placed \nfor collection in January 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 8 at 3).  \n \nAdditional delinquent debts include: a $210 medical account placed for collection \nin September 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 10 at 8); a $100 medical account \nplaced for collection in April 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.n: Gov 10 at 9); a $51 medical account \nplaced for collection in January 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.o: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 10 at 10); a $420 \nmedical account placed for collection in December 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.p: Gov 8 at 2; Gov \n10 at 6); a $185 medical account placed for collection in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.q: Gov \n8 at 2); and a $166 medical account placed for collection in September 2003 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.r: Gov 10 at 8). \n \nAdditional delinquent debts include: a $229 medical account placed for collection \nin June 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.s: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 10 at 7); a $112 medical account placed for \ncollection in September 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.t: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 10 at 9); a $180 medical \naccount placed for collection in August 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.u: Gov 9 at 7; Gov 10 at 8); a \n$544 medical account placed for collection in February 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.v: Gov 8 at 1; \nGov 9 at 9; Gov 10 at 6); a $301 medical account placed for collection in October 2006      \n\n \n4 \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.w: Gov 9 at 9); and a $120 debt owed to a city placed for collection in May \n2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.x: Gov 10 at 9). \n \nAdditional delinquent debts include: a $2,674 medical account placed for \ncollection in April 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.y: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 10 at 5); a $300 medical account \nplaced for collection in March 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.z: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 10 at 7); a $242 water \nbill placed for collection in October 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.aa: Gov 9 at 12; Gov 10 at 7); a $50 \nmedical account placed for collection in January 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.bb: Gov 10 at 10); a \n$329 telephone account placed for collection in June 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.cc: Gov 9 at 12; \nGov 10 at 6); a $180 medical account placed for collection in February 2008 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.dd: Gov 8 at 2); and an $85 medical account placed for collection in March 2007       \n(SOR \u00b6 1.ee: Gov 8 at 2). \n \nFrom 1994 to 2000, Applicant worked for a company as a shipping clerk. He \nearned $13.50 an hour in 2000. His company was bought out by another company and \nthe plant closed. Applicant found work but the pay was only $7 per hour. He worked a \ncouple of weeks then got a job as an electrician\u2019s helper. In 2001, he entered into an \napprenticeship with a union eventually earning a journeyman card. It was a five year \nprogram.  Since he was starting out, the pay was not as high as his shipping clerk\u2019s job. \n(Tr at 55 \u2013 57, 84-85.)  \n \nFor the past five years, Applicant has been the sole provider for his family. His \nincome was not sufficient to pay all of the bills. His wife is physically capable of working \nbut after paying child care expenses, there would be little extra income added to the \nfamily if she was employed. (Tr at 25, 59-60, 80-82.) Applicant states there is nothing in \nthe world that would make him jeopardize his country. (Tr at 15.)  \n \nApplicant states that he did not intentionally falsify his trustworthiness application \nor his security clearance questionnaire. He had difficulty understanding both forms \nwhen he completed the application. He was not aware of the extent of his delinquent \naccounts until he was served interrogatories pertaining to his delinquent accounts. In \nhindsight, he admits that he should have answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question pertaining to \nhaving debts that were over 180 days old. (Tr at 27, 29, 33-34, 46-47.) \n \nApplicant claims that the telephone debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.cc is paid. His phone \nservice is back on. (Tr at 49.) The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m \u2013 1.w, 1.y, 1.z, 1.bb, \n1.dd, and 1.ee are all medical accounts. Applicant has worked for numerous employers \nover the past eight years. Some of his employers did not provide health insurance. Most \nof the medical bills related to routine medical bills of Applicant\u2019s family. The $2,674 \nmedical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.y were medical expenses incurred by Applicant from a \n2006 car accident. The medical bill was for an ambulance ride and hospital treatment. \nHe was determined to be at fault in the accident. (Tr at 61-63.) \n \nThe record evidence indicates the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e \nhave been resolved.  There is no record evidence indicating the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.f \u2013 1.ee are resolved.  Applicant states the garnishment which resolved the debt \n\n \n5 \n \n \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e resulted in his getting behind on other bills. His phone is currently \nturned off because he could not pay the phone bill. He ended up selling two vehicles. \n(Tr at 86-87.) He intends to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy but had not done so at the \nclose of the record. (Tr at 27.)  \n \nApplicant has not attended financial counseling. He is current on federal and \nstate income taxes. He recently received a raise. He earns $22.61 an hour. (Tr at 82-\n83.) His net monthly take home pay without overtime is approximately $3,000. His rent \nis $750. Other monthly expenses include groceries and clothes $500 to $600; $720 car \nexpenses including insurance (a 2005 small SUV and a 2002 motorcycle); $230 medical \ninsurance; children\u2019s medical insurance $66; and utilities $300. His total monthly \nexpenses are approximately $2,566. If this amount is accurate, Applicant has \napproximately $434 left over each month after expenses. (Tr at 67-72; Gov 3 at 5.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n\n \n6 \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has encountered financial \ndifficulty since 1998 when he filed for bankruptcy. From 2000 to 2001, he wrote several \nbad checks and struggled to meet his rent payments. He recently paid off (through \ngarnishment) a $2,449 judgment entered against him in May 2008 related to an \nautomobile repossession. He currently has 23 unresolved delinquent accounts with the \ntotal approximate balance of $10,173.  Applicant\u2019s financial condition is such that he is \nunwilling or unable to resolve these accounts.   \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. He received a fresh start as a result \nof his bankruptcy discharge in 1998 but continues to incur delinquent accounts. The \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmajority of Applicant\u2019s debts remain delinquent and he has no definite plan in place to \nresolve these accounts. He continues to have significant financial problems.    \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. In 2000, Applicant was laid \noff from a job that he held for six years. The next job he found reduced his pay by half of \nwhat he was making at his previous job. His financial situation is further aggravated by \nhe and his wife\u2019s recent separation. I give this mitigating condition less weight because \nApplicant has not established a plan to resolve his delinquent accounts.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. While most of \nhis delinquent accounts have relatively low balances, he has taken no action to pay off \nany of the accounts, which indicates that his financial situation is not under control. \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Although the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n1.c, 1.d, and 1.e are resolved, Applicant did not pay these debts until after he was taken \nto court. He has not developed a plan to resolve his 23 remaining delinquent accounts. \nWhile Applicant testified at hearing that he intends to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, he \nhad not done so at the close of the record. Even if he had filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy, it would be too soon to conclude that his financial situation is stable.  \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list several \nfinancial delinquencies on his security clearance questionnaires. Specifically, he failed \nto list his delinquent debts that were over 90 or 180 days old in response to sections \n28(a) and 28(b) on his security questionnaire (e-QIP) dated September 6, 2007. He also \ndid not list the legal judgments obtained against him for unpaid rent (SOR \u00b6 1.d) in \nresponse to section 22(a) on his questionnaire for public trust position. He did not list his \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndelinquent debts that were over 180 days old on the same questionnaire for public trust \nposition in response to section 22(b). \n \n  \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies in \nApplicant\u2019s case. For PC DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission of his judgments and \ndelinquent accounts must be done with a deliberate intent to deceive. I find Applicant \ndid not deliberately intend to falsify his security clearance questionnaires. Applicant \nclaims that he did not remember all of his financial delinquencies. He did not obtain a \ncopy of his credit report until he received some interrogatories which listed his \ndelinquent accounts. I find his explanation credible. During the hearing, Applicant \nadmitted that he was somewhat confused about the security clearance application.  \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern is found for Applicant.  \n \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant has \nresolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.e.  However, Applicant has had additional \ndelinquent accounts for several years and has no plan for resolving the accounts. While \nApplicant\u2019s recent marital separation further complicates matters, he took no steps such \nas financial counseling to develop of plan for resolving these accounts prior to his \nseparation. His financial problems remain. At this point, Applicant did not mitigate the \nconcerns raised under financial considerations. Personal conduct concerns are \nmitigated because Applicant did not intend to falsify his security clearance questionnaire \nand application for a public trust position by omitting his delinquent debts.  \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.x:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.y:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.z:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.aa:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.bb:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.cc:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.dd:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ee:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nDecember 12, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (QSP), on February\n21, 2006.  On June 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nL, C and B for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 30, 2008.  He answered the\nSOR in writing that same day, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.\nDOHA received the request soon thereafter, and I received the case assignment on\nAugust 25, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing that same day, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on September 11, 2008.  The Government offered Exhibits (GXs)\n1 and 2, which were received without objection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf\n\n2\nand submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through N, without objection.  DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (TR) on September 19, 2008.  As the SOR was amended by\nthe Government at the hearing, I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open\nfor one month, until October 10, 2008, to submit additional matters.  On September 21,\n2008, he submitted Exhibit O, to which the Government made no objection, on October\n7, 2008. The record closed on October 10, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding Subparagraph 1.b,\nalleging the following: \u201cSince some time after March of 2006, you have been a\ncontractor for the Australian government\u201d (TR at page 32 lines 6~10).  Applicant made\nno objection, but asked that the record be kept open for a month so that he might further\naddress this new allegation.  This request was granted (TR at page 34 lines 11~20).\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the factual allegations of the\nSOR.  He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.\nOutside Activities, Foreign Preference & Foreign Influence\nThe Applicant is a college professor, who does a lot of consulting work at the\nbehest of the U.S. Government (TR at page 37 lines 7~17, GX 1 at page 2, and AppX\nA).\n1.a., 2.a. and 3.a.  Since about January of 2000, the Applicant has been a\nrepresentative of the United Kingdom (UK) on an International Standards Organization\n(TR at page 48 line 23 to page 49 line 5, at page 51 line 15 to page 52 line 15, at page\n60 line 6, and at page 76 lines 7~21).  His participation is authorized by the U.S.\nGovernment (Id, and Tr at page 90 lines 7~14, and AppXs G, H and O).  The\nApplicant\u2019s Temporary Duty Pay (TDY), vis-a-vis his representation, is also paid for by\nthe U.S. Government (Id).\n1.b.  Since some time after March of 2006, the Applicant has been a contractor\nfor the Australian government (TR at page 31 line 7 to page 32 line 8).  His participation\nis also authorized by the U.S. Government (Id, and Tr at page 90 lines 15~18, and\nAppXs G, H and O).  The Applicant\u2019s Temporary Duty Pay (TDY), vis-a-vis his\ncontractor work, is paid for by the U.S. Government (Id).\n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline L - Outside Activities\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Outside Activities is set out in\nParagraph 36: \u201cInvolvement in certain types of outside employment or activities is of\nsecurity concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual\u2019s security\nresponsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized disclosure of\nclassified information\u201d (Emphasis supplied).\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.\nSubparagraph 37(a) arguably applies; i.e., \u201cany employment or service, whether\ncompensated or volunteer, with: (1) the government of a foreign country.\u201d  Here, the\nApplicant, at the behest of U.S. Government, works for the UK and Australia.  This is\nclearly countered, however, by Mitigating Condition 38(a), an \u201cevaluation of the outside\nemployment . . . indicates that it does not pose a conflict with an individual\u2019s security\nresponsibilities or with the national security interests of the United States.\u201d  His\nparticipation as a representative of the (UK) on an International Standards Organization,\nis clearly sanctioned by the U.S. Government.  His being a contractor with Australia is\nalso sanctioned by the U.S. Government.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in\nParagraph 9: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States . . . \u201d (Emphasis supplied).  I can find no\napplicable Disqualifying Condition here.  What the Applicant does vis-a-vis the UK and\nAustralia is at the behest of and sanctioned by the U.S. Government.\nGuideline C - Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nParagraph 6: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties. . . \u201d (Emphasis supplied).  Again, I can find no applicable\nDisqualifying Condition here.  What the Applicant does vis-a-vis the UK and Australia is\nat the behest of and sanctioned by the U.S. Government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\n\n5\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from his Outside Activities, and perceived Foreign Preference and Foreign\nInfluence.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline L:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 31, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\n\n2\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. On July 31, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the hearing transcript contained\nerrors that affected the outcome of the case; (2) whether certain of the Judge\u2019s formal findings do\nnot coincide with the analysis in the body of his decision; (3) whether the Judge was biased; and (4)\nwhether the Judge\u2019s decision was inconsistent with the facts of the case.  For the following reasons,\nthe Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision.\nSome of Applicant\u2019s assertions on appeal rely on matters not contained in the record below.\nAs such, the assertions are based on new evidence.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on\nappeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe Judge found that Applicant was involved in numerous incidents with law enforcement\nbetween 1998 and 2006 resulting from criminal conduct.  In 1998, an altercation between Applicant\nand his mother\u2019s boyfriend led to Applicant\u2019s being charged with brandishing a firearm.  In 2002,\nApplicant was arrested and charged with Underage Possession of alcohol.  In 2003, Applicant was\narrested and charged with Assault and Battery.  He was found guilty, and an appeal was resolved by\na payment by Applicant of $1,100 in fines and costs.  In 2004, Applicant was charged with\nPossession of Marijuana, Possession of Narcotic Equipment, and an open container violation.  In\n2005, Applicant was charged with an Open Container violation.  In 2006, Applicant was arrested and\ncharged with Assault and Battery and Public Swearing/Intoxication.  Applicant pled guilty to an\namended charge of Disorderly Conduct and Public Swearing/Intoxication.  \nThe Judge also found that Applicant completed a security clearance application in 2007.  In\nresponse to a question about being charged or convicted of any offense related to alcohol or drugs,\nApplicant did not disclose the alcohol-related charges of 2002 and 2005, nor did he disclose the\nalcohol and drug-related charge of 2004.  In response to a question asking about arrests, charges, and\nconvictions for offenses not otherwise listed, Applicant did not list the 2003 arrest.  In response to\na question about illegal use of controlled substances, including marijuana, the Judge found that\nApplicant disclosed marijuana use that occurred between February 1998 and April 1998 but did not\ndisclose marijuana use that occurred in 2004.  On a set of interrogatories completed in March 2008,\nApplicant accurately disclosed his marijuana use, but did not disclose the 2002, 2003 and 2005\nincidents.  \nThe Judge concluded that the 1998 firearm brandishing incident was mitigated by Applicant\u2019s\nage and other circumstances.  Regarding the other offenses that took place between 2002 and 2006,\nthe Judge concluded that the offenses were minor, that they were committed while Applicant was\nin his late teens and early twenties as a college student.  The Judge also concluded that Applicant had\nsince obtained a job, gotten married, and volunteered in the community.  The Judge concluded that\nthere was evidence of successful rehabilitation, and that Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 31(d) applied.\n\nThis should not be interpreted as an indication that the Board finds the transcript to be flawless.  Rather, it is\n1\nsimply the case that Applicant has not alleged, and the Board does not see, any specific harmful errors resulting from\nthe transcript.\nThe Judge specifically found the allegation at subparagraph 1.a. under Guideline J to be mitigated.\n2\n3\nNotwithstanding these conclusions, in his formal findings, the Judge found against Applicant under\nGuideline J for the 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 incidents.\nRegarding the Guideline E allegations of falsification, the Judge concluded that Applicant\nfalsified his responses to the questions about arrests or charges by not disclosing his involvement in\nthe 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 incidents.  The Judge concluded that Applicant also deliberately\nomitted the 2002, 2003, and 2005 incidents from his responses to the March 2008 set of\ninterrogatories.  The Judge concluded that these falsifications were unmitigated, and he did not\naccept Applicant\u2019s explanations that the omissions were the product of not reading the questions\ncarefully or misinterpreting the questions.\nApplicant questions the accuracy of the hearing transcript and asserts that these inaccuracies\nimpeded the Judge\u2019s ability to make a fully fair, impartial, and properly weighted decision.\nApplicant claims that errors occur on 100 pages of the 301 page transcript.  However, Applicant\nspecifically identifies only one error in his brief.  That alleged error, one which may have led the\nJudge to conclude erroneously that Applicant was taken to a police station following the 1998\nincident, when Applicant says he was not, would in any case be harmless given the fact that the 1998\nincident was not the subject of an adverse finding by the Judge under either Guideline J or Guideline\nE.  Apart from this one instance, Applicant provides no information whatever concerning multiple\ntranscript errors, or how any errors adversely affected the Judge\u2019s ability to properly evaluate the\ncase.  Moreover, Applicant relies heavily on transcript references in his exposition of the facts of the\ncase in his brief.  An appealing party must set forth its claims of error with specificity.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 99-0519 at 9 (App. Bd. Feb. 23, 2001).  Applicant fails to establish that the contents\nof the hearing transcript improperly prejudiced his case.1\nApplicant claims that some of the language in the \u201cAnalysis\u201d section of the Judge\u2019s decision\nis at odds with the formal findings made by the Judge.  Specifically, Applicant states that\nsubparagraphs 1.b-1.f. under Guideline J are mitigated in the narrative portion of the analysis, in\ncontrast to the ultimate formal findings, where the Judge finds against Applicant under those same\nsubparagraphs.  Applicant\u2019s claim of error has merit.\nAlthough the Judge does not discuss each allegation in his analysis, a reading of the overall\ndiscussion under Guideline J indicates that the Judge considered allegations 1.b.-1.f. to be mitigated.2\nThis reading is supported by additional language at the end of the decision under the whole person\nanalysis, where the Judge reiterates his conclusion that the arrests and charges which occurred during\nApplicant\u2019s college days were not predictive of future behavior.  Thus, the adverse formal findings\nunder Guideline J listed at the end of the Judge\u2019s decision do not accurately reflect the contents of\nthe Judge\u2019s decision and are in error.  However, this error does not require remedial action.\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 53.\n3\nId.\n4\n4\nInasmuch as the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions under Guideline E are independent of the error,\nand inasmuch as the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions under Guideline E are sustainable, the error\nis harmless.\nApplicant\u2019s claim of bias relates to the Judge\u2019s statements and rulings on the testimony of\nApplicant\u2019s mother who was called as a witness in Applicant\u2019s case.  The mother was an eyewitness\nto the 1998 incident where Applicant ended up being charged with brandishing a firearm.  The\nmother also attended Applicant\u2019s criminal court trial in 2003, where a video tape of the incident\nproduced by the commercial establishment where the incident took place was shown in open court.\nAt the security clearance hearing, the mother was asked to testify as to what she saw on the video\ntape.  She was also asked to testify as to what she saw on a second video tape, also produced by a\ncommercial establishment, of the 2006 incident.  Department Counsel objected to the line of\nquestioning and the witness\u2019s testimony regarding the video tapes of the 2003 and 2006 incidents.\nThe Judge\u2019s ruling on the matter is not a model of clarity.  Initially, the Judge sustained the\nobjection and indicated to Applicant\u2019s counsel that he wasn\u2019t going to allow counsel to ask the\nmother about what she saw on the videos.  When discussing the ruling with Applicant\u2019s counsel, the\nJudge stated that Applicant was available to testify about the incident.  The Judge then stated, \u201cThere\nis no probative value to that for him.  You\u2019re drafting somebody\u2019s mom about what happened in a\ncriminal case.  It\u2019s at best so minimal, even if I were to allow it and it takes 10 minutes, I\u2019m not\ngoing to consider it quite frankly.\u201d   The Judge ultimately allowed Applicant\u2019s counsel to proceed\n3\nwith questioning of the mother while indicating that he was going to give the testimony such\nminimal value that \u201cwhether I actually allow you to go there or not is not going to make a difference\nin the decision that I render.\u201d     \n4\nApplicant notes correctly that injudicious language by an administrative judge may give rise\nto questions of bias.  He states that the Judge voiced what was tantamount to a scolding to\nApplicant\u2019s counsel for calling Applicant\u2019s mother as a witness.  Applicant states that the Judge had\nno reason to believe that the testimony given by his mother would be anything less than honest.\nApplicant insists that the appearance of bias damages the validity of the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that an administrative judge is fair and impartial, and a\nparty seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  ISCR Case No.\n03-03974 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2006).  Bias involves partiality for or against a party,\npredisposition to decide a case or issue without regard to the merits, or other indicia of a lack of\nimpartiality.  See ISCR Case No. 03-07245 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 20, 2005).  Bias is not\ndemonstrated merely because a party can demonstrate a Judge committed a factual or legal error.\nThe standard is not whether a party personally believes a Judge was biased or prejudiced against that\nparty, but rather whether the record of the proceedings below contains any indication that the Judge\n\n5\nacted in a manner that would lead a reasonable, disinterested person to question the fairness and\nimpartiality of the Judge.  Id.  While Applicant raises non-frivolous concerns about the manner in\nwhich the Judge handled the evidentiary issue of his mother\u2019s testimony, Applicant\u2019s claim of bias\nis not persuasive.\nThe Judge\u2019s comment on the record about the witness being \u201cdrafted\u201d was ill-advised.  His\nstatements on the record about his intentions to discount her testimony, particularly before that\ntestimony was completed, was error.  However, the Judge did not make these remarks gratuitously.\nHe was engaged in an exchange with Applicant\u2019s counsel and was attempting to explain his\nreservations about receiving the witness\u2019s testimony.  Irrespective of his method of communicating\nthose reservations, the Judge\u2019s reservations had a basis, namely the fact that an applicant\u2019s mother,\nbecause of her likely loyalty to her child, might not provide objective testimony regarding disputed\nfacts that went to the merits of the child\u2019s case.  In determining whether the Judge demonstrated bias,\nthe Board will not view the specified actions of the Judge in isolation.  Rather, the Board will look\nto the totality of the record and the Judge\u2019s decision to determine whether or not the Judge was\nimpartial.  In this regard, there is nothing else in the record or in the Judge\u2019s decision that would\ncause a reasonable, disinterested person to question the Judge\u2019s fairness.  In this case, while the\nrecord contains findings and conclusions against Applicant, it also contains numerous findings and\nconclusions favorable to Applicant.  In fact, Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony involved incidents under\nGuideline J which the Judge ultimately concluded were no longer of security concern.  When the\ncase is viewed in its totality, Applicant has not met his heavy burden of establishing bias.  Also, any\nerror by the Judge in dealing with Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony was ultimately harmless. \nConcerning the last issue raised on appeal, Applicant essentially argues that the record\nevidence does not support the Judge\u2019s ultimate adverse security clearance decision, specifically the\nJudge\u2019s findings and conclusions that Applicant engaged in falsification under Guideline E and that\nsuch conduct was not mitigated.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not establish error on the part of the\nJudge. \nAlthough the Judge was required to consider Applicant\u2019s explanations as to why he answered\nthe security clearance application and interrogatory questions the way he did, he was not required\nto accept those explanations.  A case involving alleged falsification requires a Judge to make a\nfinding of fact as to an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the alleged falsification occurred. As\na practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind may not always be based\non an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may rely on circumstantial evidence.  It is not mere\nspeculation or surmise for a Judge to make a finding of fact about an applicant\u2019s intent or state of\nmind based on circumstantial evidence.  To the contrary, it is legally permissible to do so.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 00-0601 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2001).   In this case, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s\neducational background, job history, and other achievements when evaluating the plausibility of\nApplicant\u2019s claim that he either didn\u2019t read or misunderstood the questions regarding criminal\ninvolvements and drug use.  The Judge also noted the unbelievable nature of Applicant\u2019s testimony\nregarding a particular arrest and indicated the negative effect that testimony had upon his assessment\nof Applicant\u2019s credibility.  The Judge\u2019s conclusions in this regard are sustainable on this record.\nApplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or Applicant\u2019s ability to argue\n\n6\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\n After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when\n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Cohen, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant\u2019s history of criminal charges, arrests, and citations generates a criminal\nconduct security concern. His failure to disclose his entire criminal history on his\nsecurity clearance application raises a personal conduct security concern. After\ncarefully considering the evidence, I conclude Applicant\u2019s conduct remains a security\nconcern. Clearance is denied.\nOn July 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nJ, criminal conduct, and E, personal conduct. The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 5, 2008, admitting all of the\nallegations except SOR subparagraph 2.d, and requesting a hearing. On January 23,\nJuly 31, 2009\n\nISCR Case No. 03-07826 (App. Board June 17, 2005) at 3.\n1\n2\n2009, Applicant filed an amended SOR answer changing his admissions of SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.b through 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, and SOR paragraph 2 to denials. The case\nwas assigned to me on April 30, 2009. On May 8, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued\nscheduling the case for June 2, 2009. It was held as scheduled. At the hearing, I\nreceived nine government exhibits, four Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of five\nApplicant witnesses. The transcript was received on June 12, 2009.\nRuling on Procedure\nSOR subparagraph 1.g alleges that Applicant \u201cfalsified at least one response on\n[his] Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing, dated July 23, 2007, in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, a federal felony.\u201d This allegation is overbroad because it\ndoes not identify a specific question on the Electronic Questionnaire that Applicant\nallegedly falsified. Although an SOR does not have to satisfy the strict requirements of a\ncriminal indictment, it must still place an applicant on adequate notice of the allegations\nso that he may have a reasonable opportunity to respond and prepare a defense.1\nSubparagraph 1.g. does not meet this minimum threshold, therefore, I conclude that it is\nnot justiciable.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 25-year-old married man. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in\nbusiness administration in 2006, graduating with a 3.0 grade point average (Exhibit A).\nSince 2007, he has worked for a defense contractor as a financial analyst in support of\nan agency within the DoD. He manages a multi-million dollar budget, and assists the\nagency in developing financial plans and analyzing the agency\u2019s fiscal relationship with\nother contractors (Tr. 144; Exhibit B). According to Applicant\u2019s supervisor, he is an\noutstanding employee who works well without much guidance (Tr. 91). Applicant\nvolunteers in the community assisting the homeowner\u2019s association in organizing annual\nfestivals (Tr. 270).\nApplicant\u2019s parents separated when he was approximately 14 years old.\nApproximately one month after they separated, Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s boyfriend relocated\nto the home of Applicant and his mother. One morning, as Applicant was preparing to\nleave for school, his mother admonished him for running late (Tr. 152). Her boyfriend\nthen interjected, ordering him in an abrasive and profane manner, to go to school. (Id.).\nA heated argument then ensued between Applicant and his mother\u2019s boyfriend\n(Tr. 153). Applicant ran out of the house, realized he forgot something, then returned to\nthe house, and ran up the stairs toward his room. As Applicant was running up the\nstairs, his mother\u2019s boyfriend met him at the top of the stairs, and kneed him in the face,\nbreaking his nose (Id.). His mother\u2019s boyfriend continued to yell at him. Fearing the\nsituation was \u201cgoing to turn worse,\u201d Applicant reached into the linen closet, grabbed his\nmother\u2019s pistol, pointed it at her boyfriend, and told him to leave the house (Tr. 154).\n\n3\nApplicant sought medical treatment, and did not go to school that day. He\nreturned to school the following day. By then both of his eyes had bruised, attracting the\nattention of school personnel who called his mother, and asked her to come to the\nschool immediately (Tr. 157). After a meeting with Applicant and his mother, school\npersonnel then contacted the school police officer who took him to the police station (Tr.\n158). Applicant was then charged with brandishing a firearm. Later, Applicant pleaded\nno contest, at his mother\u2019s advice, and was sentenced to probation (Tr. 159). The\nboyfriend was not charged.\nAt the hearing, a longtime family friend of Applicant testified. This friend is a\nretired Army veteran who met Applicant\u2019s parents shortly after enlisting, and knew\nApplicant since Applicant was a toddler. Shortly after Applicant\u2019s parents separated, he\nmet Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s boyfriend. According to the family friend, the boyfriend was a\n\u201cbully,\u201d and a \u201ctotal SOB\u201d who frequently attempted to intimidate people (Tr. 127). Once,\nthe witness nearly had a physical altercation with the boyfriend related to an incident. \nIn 2002, during Applicant\u2019s freshman year in college, while leaving a keg party at\na college fraternity house, he was stopped by a police officer, and issued a ticket for\n\u201cpossession by consumption\u201d of alcohol (Tr. 161). Applicant was not arrested (Tr. 164).\nThe officer stopped him because she smelled beer on his breath. Applicant went to\ncourt, and was ordered to attend alcohol safety awareness classes (Tr. 162). He did so,\nand the court dropped the charge (Id.). \nOn September 7, 2003, Applicant and a college classmate went to a tow truck\ncompany to retrieve a towed vehicle. Applicant got into a heated argument with the tow\ntruck company owner regarding damage to the vehicle that allegedly occurred while the\ncar was in the company owner\u2019s custody (Tr. 164). The tow truck company owner\u2019s son\nthen pushed Applicant out of the front door, and began to \u201cgrapple\u201d with him (Tr. 167).\nAt some point during the melee, Applicant pushed the front door inwards hitting the tow\ntruck company owner in the face (Tr. 167, 253). \nAfter the scuffle ended, Applicant and his friend left the premises, and called the\npolice (Tr. 168). The police arrived, spoke with Applicant and the tow truck company\nowner, and characterized the dispute as a \u201che said/she said thing\u201d (Tr. 168). \nThe next day, the tow truck company owner pressed charges against Applicant\nalleging assault and battery. The police then arrested Applicant. After a bench trial,\nApplicant was found guilty of the charge, a misdemeanor. He appealed it. While the\nappeal was pending, the parties settled the matter. Under the settlement, Applicant\nagreed to pay the tow truck company owner $1,100 in restitution, and the charges were\nnolle prossed (Tr. 174). \nIn March 2004, while on spring break, Applicant was arrested and charged with\nmisdemeanor marijuana possession, possession of narcotic equipment, and walking in\na public area with an open container of alcohol (Tr. 174). Subsequently, Applicant\nattended a diversion program, whereupon the state dismissed the charges (Tr. 177).\n\n4\nOn September 2, 2005, while attending an off-campus block party, Applicant was\nissued a citation for carrying an open container of alcohol in public (Tr. 180). He was\nfined $76, which he paid through the mail (Tr. 182).\nOn May 3, 2006 Applicant and some friends went to a late-night\ncarryout/convenience store after an evening of carousing (Tr. 183). Applicant got into an\nargument with the store clerk regarding an erroneous sandwich order. He contends he\nwas \u201cspeaking sensibly\u201d during the argument (Tr. 257). An undercover officer then\napproached Applicant from behind and grabbed him by the arm (Tr. 187, 257). When\nApplicant \u201cpulled [his] arm back,\u201d the officer \u201cstarted going for her mace\u201d (Tr. 187).\nApplicant placed his hands in the air, and said, \u201care you going to mace me right here,\nright [in] front of all these people?\u201d (Id.). The officer then handcuffed Applicant, arrested\nhim, and charged him with felony assault and battery, in addition to public\nswearing/intoxication (Tr. 184-186).\nThe assault charge was later amended to disorderly conduct. Ultimately,\nApplicant was found guilty of both charges, sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended,\nplaced on probation for a year, ordered to do 30 hours of community service, and fined\n$25 (Tr. 260).\nApplicant completed a security clearance application on July 23, 2007. In\nresponse to Section 23d (Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any\noffense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?), he disclosed the 2006 charges stemming from\nthe convenience store incident, but did not disclose the alcohol-related charges of 2002\nand 2005, and the alcohol and drug-related charge of 2004. In response to Section 23f\n(In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any\noffense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, or d, above?). Applicant did not disclose the\n2003 arrest stemming from the tow truck company incident.\nAs for the alcohol-related charges of 2005, Applicant contends that he was\nunaware it was a charge because he was merely issued a ticket which he paid through\nthe mail without a court appearance. As for the remainder of the offenses, Applicant\ncontends he misinterpreted the questions believing that he did not need to list charges\nthat did not result in his arrest, or were either dismissed or nolle prossed (Tr. 241, 249).\nWhen asked during cross examination why he misconstrued Section 23 in light of\ninstructions directing applicants to report information regardless of whether it was\nstricken from the record, Applicant responded, \u201cI moved right from reading Section 23\n\u2018Your Police Record,\u2019 to \u2018answer the following questions,\u2019 and just began checking them\noff\u201d (Tr. 228). In response to Section 23b (Have you ever been charged with or\nconvicted of a firearms or explosives offense?), Applicant disclosed the 1998 firearm\ncharge. \nIn response to Section 24a (Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever\nis shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana,\ncocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics  . . . or prescription drugs?) Applicant\ndisclosed marijuana use that occurred between February 1998 and April 1998, but did\nnot disclose marijuana use that occurred in 2004. He contends that he erroneously\n\n5\nlisted April 1998 as the time his marijuana use ended. Instead, it ended in April 2004. In\nresponse to a March 2008 interrogatory, Applicant disclosed the 2004 marijuana use,\nincluding two incidents when the marijuana was laced with cocaine unbeknownst to him\nwhen he smoked it (Exhibit 8 at 4).\nOn the March 2008 interrogatory, Applicant also disclosed the 2004 alcohol and\ndrug-related charge (Id.). He did not disclose the 2003 assault and battery charge, or\nthe alcohol possession charges of 2002 and 2005. He offered the same explanation for\nomitting these charges from the interrogatory that he offered for omitting them from the\nsecurity clearance application. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d Moreover, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations (AG \u00b6 30).\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct triggers the application of AG \u00b6 31(a), a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d \nApplicant was 15 years old when he was charged with brandishing a firearm.\nDuring the two months before the incident which precipitated the charge, Applicant\u2019s\nparents divorced, and his mother\u2019s volatile boyfriend moved into their home, and\nattempted to exercise parental authority over Applicant. Under these circumstances,\nconflict was inevitable. Given the longtime family friend\u2019s characterization of Applicant\u2019s\nmother\u2019s boyfriend, Applicant\u2019s explanation for drawing the gun on the boyfriend was\ncredible. I resolve SOR subparagraph 1.a in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nApplicant committed the offenses when he was in his late teens and early\ntwenties while in college. They were minor in nature. Since graduating from college,\nApplicant obtained a job where he has excelled, and he has gotten married. Also, he\nvolunteers in the community. AG \u00b6 31(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding, but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse, or restitution, job training, or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement,\u201d applies. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern under this guideline is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process (AG \u00b6 15).\nApplicant\u2019s omissions from his 2007 security clearance application and 2008\ninterrogatory responses raise the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. \nApplicant was an exceptional college student who has excelled, since graduating,\nin a highly challenging job. His employer praised his ability at working without much\nsupervision. Under these circumstances, it is not credible that Applicant did not read\nSection 23 of the security clearance application carefully, as he testified. \nIn reaching this conclusion, I also considered Applicant\u2019s unbelievable testimony\nregarding the 2006 arrest. Specifically, his argument with a convenience store proprietor\nwas disruptive enough to prompt an undercover police officer to grab him, threaten to\nmace him, and ultimately arrest him. Applicant, however, maintains that he was\n\nApplicant\u2019s 2007 security clearance application only required him to list drug use that occurred within\n2\nseven years of its completion.\n7\nspeaking sensibly during the entire incident. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR subparagraphs\n2.a, 2.b and 2.e without mitigation.\nI conclude that Applicant did not falsify Section 24a regarding past drug use. He\nanswered \u201cyes\u201d and disclosed marijuana use from 1998 even though he was not\nrequired to do so.  Under these circumstances, it is credible that he made a mistake\n2\nwhen he incorrectly stated the drug use ended in 1998. Also, on an interrogatory\ncompleted the following year, he disclosed the correct extent of his marijuana use, in\naddition to two episodes of cocaine use, without prompting. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply\nto Applicant\u2019s response to Section 24a. I find in his favor as to SOR subparagraph 2.c.\nThe SOR also alleges Applicant deliberately provided false information to a\nrepresentative of the Office of Personal Management (OPM) in 2007 (subparagraph\n1.d). Applicant denied this allegation, and the government did not provide any evidence\nsupporting the allegation. SOR subparagraph 2.d is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s immaturity was a major contributing factor for his past criminal\nconduct. Given the maturity he has demonstrated since graduating from college (getting\nmarried, excelling on the job, volunteering in the community), I conclude that the arrests\nand charges which occurred while in college are not predictive of future behavior.\nApplicant, however, falsified his security clearance application, a crime under 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1001. This occurred just two years ago, after Applicant finished college. Given this\nfalsification, I cannot conclude Applicant has mitigated either the criminal or personal\nconduct security concerns. Upon evaluating this case in the context of the whole person\nconcept, I conclude Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance must be denied.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.c - 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. 2 Some of Applicant\u2019s assertions on appeal rely on matters not contained in the record below. As such, the assertions are based on new evidence. The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. The Judge found that Applicant was involved in numerous incidents with law enforcement between 1998 and 2006 resulting from criminal conduct. In 1998, an altercation between Applicant and his mother\u2019s boyfriend led to Applicant\u2019s being charged with brandishing a firearm. In 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with Underage Possession of alcohol. In 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with Assault and Battery. He was found guilty, and an appeal was resolved by a payment by Applicant of $1,100 in fines and costs. In 2004, Applicant was charged with Possession of Marijuana, Possession of Narcotic Equipment, and an open container violation. In 2005, Applicant was charged with an Open Container violation. In 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with Assault and Battery and Public Swearing/Intoxication.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 31, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. On July 31, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the hearing transcript contained\nerrors that affected the outcome of the case; (2) whether certain of the Judge\u2019s formal findings do\nnot coincide with the analysis in the body of his decision; (3) whether the Judge was biased; and (4)\nwhether the Judge\u2019s decision was inconsistent with the facts of the case.  For the following reasons,\nthe Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision.\n\n2\nSome of Applicant\u2019s assertions on appeal rely on matters not contained in the record below.\nAs such, the assertions are based on new evidence.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on\nappeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe Judge found that Applicant was involved in numerous incidents with law enforcement\nbetween 1998 and 2006 resulting from criminal conduct.  In 1998, an altercation between Applicant\nand his mother\u2019s boyfriend led to Applicant\u2019s being charged with brandishing a firearm.  In 2002,\nApplicant was arrested and charged with Underage Possession of alcohol.  In 2003, Applicant was\narrested and charged with Assault and Battery.  He was found guilty, and an appeal was resolved by\na payment by Applicant of $1,100 in fines and costs.  In 2004, Applicant was charged with\nPossession of Marijuana, Possession of Narcotic Equipment, and an open container violation.  In\n2005, Applicant was charged with an Open Container violation.  In 2006, Applicant was arrested and\ncharged with Assault and Battery and Public Swearing/Intoxication.  Applicant pled guilty to an\namended charge of Disorderly Conduct and Public Swearing/Intoxication.  \nThe Judge also found that Applicant completed a security clearance application in 2007.  In\nresponse to a question about being charged or convicted of any offense related to alcohol or drugs,\nApplicant did not disclose the alcohol-related charges of 2002 and 2005, nor did he disclose the\nalcohol and drug-related charge of 2004.  In response to a question asking about arrests, charges, and\nconvictions for offenses not otherwise listed, Applicant did not list the 2003 arrest.  In response to\na question about illegal use of controlled substances, including marijuana, the Judge found that\nApplicant disclosed marijuana use that occurred between February 1998 and April 1998 but did not\ndisclose marijuana use that occurred in 2004.  On a set of interrogatories completed in March 2008,\nApplicant accurately disclosed his marijuana use, but did not disclose the 2002, 2003 and 2005\nincidents.  \nThe Judge concluded that the 1998 firearm brandishing incident was mitigated by Applicant\u2019s\nage and other circumstances.  Regarding the other offenses that took place between 2002 and 2006,\nthe Judge concluded that the offenses were minor, that they were committed while Applicant was\nin his late teens and early twenties as a college student.  The Judge also concluded that Applicant had\nsince obtained a job, gotten married, and volunteered in the community.  The Judge concluded that\nthere was evidence of successful rehabilitation, and that Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 31(d) applied.\nNotwithstanding these conclusions, in his formal findings, the Judge found against Applicant under\nGuideline J for the 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 incidents.\nRegarding the Guideline E allegations of falsification, the Judge concluded that Applicant\nfalsified his responses to the questions about arrests or charges by not disclosing his involvement in\nthe 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 incidents.  The Judge concluded that Applicant also deliberately\nomitted the 2002, 2003, and 2005 incidents from his responses to the March 2008 set of\ninterrogatories.  The Judge concluded that these falsifications were unmitigated, and he did not\naccept Applicant\u2019s explanations that the omissions were the product of not reading the questions\ncarefully or misinterpreting the questions.\n\nThis should not be interpreted as an indication that the Board finds the transcript to be flawless.  Rather, it is\n1\nsimply the case that Applicant has not alleged, and the Board does not see, any specific harmful errors resulting from\nthe transcript.\nThe Judge specifically found the allegation at subparagraph 1.a. under Guideline J to be mitigated.\n2\n3\nApplicant questions the accuracy of the hearing transcript and asserts that these inaccuracies\nimpeded the Judge\u2019s ability to make a fully fair, impartial, and properly weighted decision.\nApplicant claims that errors occur on 100 pages of the 301 page transcript.  However, Applicant\nspecifically identifies only one error in his brief.  That alleged error, one which may have led the\nJudge to conclude erroneously that Applicant was taken to a police station following the 1998\nincident, when Applicant says he was not, would in any case be harmless given the fact that the 1998\nincident was not the subject of an adverse finding by the Judge under either Guideline J or Guideline\nE.  Apart from this one instance, Applicant provides no information whatever concerning multiple\ntranscript errors, or how any errors adversely affected the Judge\u2019s ability to properly evaluate the\ncase.  Moreover, Applicant relies heavily on transcript references in his exposition of the facts of the\ncase in his brief.  An appealing party must set forth its claims of error with specificity.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 99-0519 at 9 (App. Bd. Feb. 23, 2001).  Applicant fails to establish that the contents\nof the hearing transcript improperly prejudiced his case.1\nApplicant claims that some of the language in the \u201cAnalysis\u201d section of the Judge\u2019s decision\nis at odds with the formal findings made by the Judge.  Specifically, Applicant states that\nsubparagraphs 1.b-1.f. under Guideline J are mitigated in the narrative portion of the analysis, in\ncontrast to the ultimate formal findings, where the Judge finds against Applicant under those same\nsubparagraphs.  Applicant\u2019s claim of error has merit.\nAlthough the Judge does not discuss each allegation in his analysis, a reading of the overall\ndiscussion under Guideline J indicates that the Judge considered allegations 1.b.-1.f. to be mitigated.2\nThis reading is supported by additional language at the end of the decision under the whole person\nanalysis, where the Judge reiterates his conclusion that the arrests and charges which occurred during\nApplicant\u2019s college days were not predictive of future behavior.  Thus, the adverse formal findings\nunder Guideline J listed at the end of the Judge\u2019s decision do not accurately reflect the contents of\nthe Judge\u2019s decision and are in error.  However, this error does not require remedial action.\nInasmuch as the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions under Guideline E are independent of the error,\nand inasmuch as the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions under Guideline E are sustainable, the error\nis harmless.\nApplicant\u2019s claim of bias relates to the Judge\u2019s statements and rulings on the testimony of\nApplicant\u2019s mother who was called as a witness in Applicant\u2019s case.  The mother was an eyewitness\nto the 1998 incident where Applicant ended up being charged with brandishing a firearm.  The\nmother also attended Applicant\u2019s criminal court trial in 2003, where a video tape of the incident\nproduced by the commercial establishment where the incident took place was shown in open court.\nAt the security clearance hearing, the mother was asked to testify as to what she saw on the video\ntape.  She was also asked to testify as to what she saw on a second video tape, also produced by a\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 53.\n3\nId.\n4\n4\ncommercial establishment, of the 2006 incident.  Department Counsel objected to the line of\nquestioning and the witness\u2019s testimony regarding the video tapes of the 2003 and 2006 incidents.\nThe Judge\u2019s ruling on the matter is not a model of clarity.  Initially, the Judge sustained the\nobjection and indicated to Applicant\u2019s counsel that he wasn\u2019t going to allow counsel to ask the\nmother about what she saw on the videos.  When discussing the ruling with Applicant\u2019s counsel, the\nJudge stated that Applicant was available to testify about the incident.  The Judge then stated, \u201cThere\nis no probative value to that for him.  You\u2019re drafting somebody\u2019s mom about what happened in a\ncriminal case.  It\u2019s at best so minimal, even if I were to allow it and it takes 10 minutes, I\u2019m not\ngoing to consider it quite frankly.\u201d   The Judge ultimately allowed Applicant\u2019s counsel to proceed\n3\nwith questioning of the mother while indicating that he was going to give the testimony such\nminimal value that \u201cwhether I actually allow you to go there or not is not going to make a difference\nin the decision that I render.\u201d     \n4\nApplicant notes correctly that injudicious language by an administrative judge may give rise\nto questions of bias.  He states that the Judge voiced what was tantamount to a scolding to\nApplicant\u2019s counsel for calling Applicant\u2019s mother as a witness.  Applicant states that the Judge had\nno reason to believe that the testimony given by his mother would be anything less than honest.\nApplicant insists that the appearance of bias damages the validity of the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that an administrative judge is fair and impartial, and a\nparty seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  ISCR Case No.\n03-03974 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2006).  Bias involves partiality for or against a party,\npredisposition to decide a case or issue without regard to the merits, or other indicia of a lack of\nimpartiality.  See ISCR Case No. 03-07245 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 20, 2005).  Bias is not\ndemonstrated merely because a party can demonstrate a Judge committed a factual or legal error.\nThe standard is not whether a party personally believes a Judge was biased or prejudiced against that\nparty, but rather whether the record of the proceedings below contains any indication that the Judge\nacted in a manner that would lead a reasonable, disinterested person to question the fairness and\nimpartiality of the Judge.  Id.  While Applicant raises non-frivolous concerns about the manner in\nwhich the Judge handled the evidentiary issue of his mother\u2019s testimony, Applicant\u2019s claim of bias\nis not persuasive.\nThe Judge\u2019s comment on the record about the witness being \u201cdrafted\u201d was ill-advised.  His\nstatements on the record about his intentions to discount her testimony, particularly before that\ntestimony was completed, was error.  However, the Judge did not make these remarks gratuitously.\nHe was engaged in an exchange with Applicant\u2019s counsel and was attempting to explain his\nreservations about receiving the witness\u2019s testimony.  Irrespective of his method of communicating\nthose reservations, the Judge\u2019s reservations had a basis, namely the fact that an applicant\u2019s mother,\n\n5\nbecause of her likely loyalty to her child, might not provide objective testimony regarding disputed\nfacts that went to the merits of the child\u2019s case.  In determining whether the Judge demonstrated bias,\nthe Board will not view the specified actions of the Judge in isolation.  Rather, the Board will look\nto the totality of the record and the Judge\u2019s decision to determine whether or not the Judge was\nimpartial.  In this regard, there is nothing else in the record or in the Judge\u2019s decision that would\ncause a reasonable, disinterested person to question the Judge\u2019s fairness.  In this case, while the\nrecord contains findings and conclusions against Applicant, it also contains numerous findings and\nconclusions favorable to Applicant.  In fact, Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony involved incidents under\nGuideline J which the Judge ultimately concluded were no longer of security concern.  When the\ncase is viewed in its totality, Applicant has not met his heavy burden of establishing bias.  Also, any\nerror by the Judge in dealing with Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony was ultimately harmless. \nConcerning the last issue raised on appeal, Applicant essentially argues that the record\nevidence does not support the Judge\u2019s ultimate adverse security clearance decision, specifically the\nJudge\u2019s findings and conclusions that Applicant engaged in falsification under Guideline E and that\nsuch conduct was not mitigated.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not establish error on the part of the\nJudge. \nAlthough the Judge was required to consider Applicant\u2019s explanations as to why he answered\nthe security clearance application and interrogatory questions the way he did, he was not required\nto accept those explanations.  A case involving alleged falsification requires a Judge to make a\nfinding of fact as to an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the alleged falsification occurred. As\na practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind may not always be based\non an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may rely on circumstantial evidence.  It is not mere\nspeculation or surmise for a Judge to make a finding of fact about an applicant\u2019s intent or state of\nmind based on circumstantial evidence.  To the contrary, it is legally permissible to do so.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 00-0601 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2001).   In this case, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s\neducational background, job history, and other achievements when evaluating the plausibility of\nApplicant\u2019s claim that he either didn\u2019t read or misunderstood the questions regarding criminal\ninvolvements and drug use.  The Judge also noted the unbelievable nature of Applicant\u2019s testimony\nregarding a particular arrest and indicated the negative effect that testimony had upon his assessment\nof Applicant\u2019s credibility.  The Judge\u2019s conclusions in this regard are sustainable on this record.\nApplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or Applicant\u2019s ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\n After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when\n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\n\n6\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under\nGuideline E is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned; Michael Y.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on February 14, 2007. On \nJune 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guidelines J, H, E, and F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nOctober 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 27, 2008, and requested a determination \non the record without a hearing. He submitted a second answer on August 1, 2008, \nwhich was received by DOHA on August 5, 2008. On August 21, 2008, Department \nCounsel requested a hearing. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September \n17, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on September 22, 2008. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on September 29, 2008, scheduling the hearing for October 20, 2008. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. I granted \nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until October 27, 2008, to enable him to \nsubmit documentary evidence, but he submitted nothing. The record closed on October \n27, 2008. DOHA received the electronic transcript on October 24, 2008, and the paper \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 28, 2008. \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b to allege that the \nsecurity clearance application that Applicant allegedly falsified was executed on \nFebruary 14, 2007 (Tr. 44-45). Applicant objected on the ground he could not remember \nwhen he actually submitted his application (Tr. 45-46). I granted the motion to amend \n(Tr. 50). The amendments are handwritten on the SOR.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in his answer to the SOR and at the \nhearing, except one delinquent debt for cable service alleged in SOR \u00b6 4.c. His \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old sheet metal mechanic employed by a defense \ncontractor (Tr. 56). He has a high school education and two years of technical college \n(Tr. 8). He has worked for his current employer since March 2006. He has never held a \nsecurity clearance. \n \n \nIn March 1995, Applicant was charged with distribution of crack cocaine, a \nfelony. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 97 months in prison, supervised release \nfor 48 months, and a $15,000 fine (GX 5 at 3). He began distributing crack cocaine \nbecause he saw the \u201ceasy money\u201d a friend was making. His friend supplied him with \ncrack cocaine for resale, and he sold it for about a year until he was arrested (Tr. 79).  \n \n \nIn August 1995, Applicant was charged with aiding or harboring a federal fugitive, \nalso a felony. The fugitive was the friend who supplied Applicant with cocaine for resale \n(Tr. 80). Applicant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 months in prison and two \nyears of supervised release (GX 5 at 3). His sentences on the two felonies were served \nconcurrently, and he was released from prison in October 2002, after spending about \nsix years and eight months in prison (GX 7 at 2; Tr. 82).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant worked in private industry as a sheet metal mechanic from November \n2003 to December 2005. He was unemployed from December 2005 until February 2006 \nand employed in private industry from February to March 2006, when he was hired for \nhis current job. \n \n \nIn November 2006, Applicant was charged with assault and battery against his \nlive-in girlfriend (GX 6 at 1). He appeared in court in February 2007, shortly after he \nsubmitted his security clearance application, and he pleaded guilty (Tr. 90). The record \ndoes not indicate what sentence was imposed. \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his security clearance application, he answered \u201cno\u201d \nto question 23a, asking: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony \noffense? (Include those under Uniform Code of Military Justice).\u201d He did not disclose his \ntwo felony convictions. He testified he was confused by the reference to the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice and thought it applied only to persons in military service (Tr. \n54). He testified he left the answer to question 23a blank on his draft application, asked \nsomeone in the security office what it meant, and was told it did not apply to him. He \nalso testified he did not intend to falsify his answer because his security office knew he \nwas a convicted felon (Tr. 54).  \n \nApplicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 23d of his application, asking, \u201cHave you \never been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d He \ndid not check the block identifying the offense as a felony. In the block for explaining \naffirmative answers to any question, he stated that in March 2005 he had been charged \nwith drug possession and sentenced to probation and a fine. He listed fictitious jobs in \nSection 11 of his application and fictitious home addresses in Section 9 to cover up the \nsix years and eight months he spent in prison (Tr. 86, 88, 93).  \n \nApplicant also answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23f, asking, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have \nyou been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in \nresponse to a, b, c, d, or e above?\u201d He did not disclose that he was charged with \nassault and battery in November 2006. He testified he filled out a rough draft of his \napplication before the November 2006 incident and submitted his rough draft four or five \nmonths after he was hired, which would have been in July or August of 2006 (Tr. 104). \nHe admitted being interviewed by a security investigator and telling the investigator that \nhe was \u201cstill in court with it or whatever.\u201d No evidence was presented showing when the \nsecurity investigator\u2019s interview occurred (Tr. 109). Applicant testified he did not review \nthe final application before signing it (Tr. 107). \n \n \nIn March 2007, Applicant was charged with brandishing a firearm and assault \nand battery against a cohabitant (GX 6 at 1). Applicant testified his live-in girlfriend \nfalsely accused him of assaulting her and threatening her with a firearm. He was \nadvised of her accusation by a co-worker. He stayed overnight in a hotel instead of \ngoing home, and he turned himself in the next day (Tr. 102-03). He testified he does not \nown a firearm (Tr. 103). The charges were disposed of by a nolle prosequi on August 1, \n2007 (GX 4 at 6-9). \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling about $25,644. In his answer, \nApplicant admitted all the debts except a $44 cable bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 4.c. At the \nhearing, he testified he paid the cable bill and one of the three medical bills alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.b, 4.d, and 4.e, but he could not remember which one he paid (Tr. 61). He \nproduced no documentary evidence of payment, either at the hearing or during the time \nallotted after the hearing. He admitted the remaining delinquent debts were unresolved. \nHe testified he incurred the delinquent debts by living above his means and spending \nmore than he was making (Tr. 67). He has not sought credit counseling (Tr. 71). He did \nnot disclose any delinquent debts in response to question 28 on his security clearance \napplication.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was convicted of two felonies in 1995, pleaded guilty \nto an assault and battery in November 2006, was charged with an assault and battery \nand brandishing a firearm in March 2007, and falsified his security clearance application \nin violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. The concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \n\u201ccreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation \nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally \ncharged, formally prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c).  \n \n \nAlthough the evidence suggests that the charges of assault and battery and \nbrandishing a firearm in March 2007 were unfounded, Applicant\u2019s two felony convictions \nin 1995, his conviction of assault and battery in November 2006, and his falsification of \nhis security clearance application, discussed below under Guideline E, are sufficient to \nraise AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (b), shifting the burden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). The first prong of \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) (Aso much time has elapsed@) focuses on the recentness of criminal \nconduct. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. \nISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa \nsignificant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an \nadministrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \nApplicant was released from prison in October 2002, about six years ago. Since \nthen, he has been convicted of assault and battery in November 2006, and he admitted \nat the hearing that he falsified his employment record and list of residences on his \nsecurity clearance application in February 2007. His continued misconduct precludes a \nfinding of rehabilitation and negates the first prong of AG \u00b6 32(a). None of his offenses \noccurred under unusual circumstances, but they do raise doubt about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on criminal conduct may be mitigated by \u201cevidence that \nthe person did not commit the offense.\u201d AG 32(c). This mitigating condition is \nestablished for the charges of assault and battery and brandishing a weapon that arose \nin March 2007 and were disposed of by a nolle prosequi (SOR \u00b6 1.a), but it is not \nestablished for the remaining allegations under Guideline J.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence \nof successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). As \nnoted above, Applicant\u2019s continued criminal conduct after his release from prison \nprecludes a finding of successful rehabilitation. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(d) is not established. \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s conviction for distribution of crack \ncocaine, also alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. The concern under this guideline is as follows: AUse \nof an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 24. This guideline encompasses behavior involving \nADrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled \nSubstances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, \nnarcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens)\u201d AG \u00b6 24(a)(1).  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is Aillegal drug possession, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.@ AG \u00b6 25 (c). The evidence in this case establishes Applicant\u2019s \npossession and distribution of crack cocaine, a controlled substance.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong (\u201cso \nlong ago\u201d) is not established. Although Applicant\u2019s last drug involvement was about 13 \nyears ago, he continued his pattern of criminal conduct after his release from prison. \nSignificantly, his conduct in 1995 was not motivated by drug addiction, but rather by a \ndesire for \u201ceasy money\u201d and a disregard for the law. He has continued to demonstrate \nhis disregard for the law, as evidenced by his assault and battery conviction in 2006 and \nhis falsification of his security clearance application. His conduct was not infrequent, \nbecause he sold crack cocaine for about a year before he was arrested, and he \ncontinued to violate the law after his release from prison. His drug involvement did not \nhappen under unusual circumstances, and his pattern of criminal conduct casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 26(a) is \nnot established. No other enumerated mitigating conditions under this guideline are \nrelevant. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified his security clearance application by \ndeliberately failing to disclose two felony convictions in 1995 and a charge of assault \nand battery in 2006. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation that he answered question 23a in the negative because \nhe thought it applied only to military personnel might be plausible if he had been candid \n\n \n8 \n \n \nelsewhere in his application. Instead, he understated his offense and sentence in \nresponse to question 23d, did not check the block identifying it as a felony, and falsified \nhis employment record and list of residences to cover up his six years and eight months \nin prison. Based on all the circumstances, I found his explanation neither plausible nor \ncredible. I conclude he intentionally falsified his answer to question 23a. \n \n \nApplicant testified he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23f and did not disclose the \nassault and battery charges based on his November 2006 altercation because it \nhappened before he submitted his rough draft of his application. This was Applicant\u2019s \nfirst trip through the security clearance application process. Although he may have been \ncareless by not reviewing the final version of his application before signing it, the \nevidence is unclear on issue whether he intentionally falsified the answer to question \n23f. Accordingly, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 3.b in his favor. Based on his false answer to \nquestion 23a, however, I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). This mitigating condition is not established, because Applicant \nmade no effort to correct his omissions and misstatements. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on false or misleading answers also may be mitigated \nby showing that \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized \npersonnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning \nthe security clearance process.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(b). Although Applicant testified he was \nadvised by someone in his security officer that question 23a was not applicable to him, \nhis testimony was uncorroborated, and it is not plausible or credible in light of his \nfalsifications of his responses to questions 23d, his employment record, and his list of \nresidences. I conclude this mitigating condition is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant\u2019s falsification was a felony, \nwas recent, was one of several significant falsifications in his application, did not occur \nunder unique circumstances, and casts doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). Applicant receives some credit under this \nmitigating condition because it appears that he disclosed to his employer that he was a \nconvicted felon, although it also appears that he understated the severity of his criminal \nconduct and did not disclose his time in prison. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling about $25,644. The concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised where there is an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-\npronged condition that is raised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or \nirresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay \nthe debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is \nAa history of not meeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is \nAconsistent spending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive \nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other \nfinancial analysis.@ Applicant\u2019s financial history, including his admission that his financial \nproblems arose from spending more than he earned, raises all these disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established because Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand did not occur under unusual circumstances.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant experienced a period of unemployment \nafter his release from prison, but this mitigating condition is not established because he \nadmitted living beyond his means even when he was employed.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not sought counseling and \nhis problem is not being resolved. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \nApplicant testified he paid a cable bill and one of three delinquent medical bills, but he \nfailed to provide documentation even after being given additional time to produce it. He \nadmitted doing virtually nothing to resolve the remaining delinquent debts. I conclude \nthis mitigating condition is not established.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J, H, E, and F in my whole person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed in my analysis of those guidelines, but some \nwarrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, intelligent adult who is struggling to overcome his past \nmistakes. His recent brushes with the law have arisen from a tumultuous relationship \nwith a live-in-girlfriend. He has foolishly tried to overcome his past by attempting to \nconceal it. He has done virtually nothing to resolve his financial situation. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J, H, E, and F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on criminal conduct, drug involvement, \npersonal conduct, and financial considerations. Accordingly, I conclude he has not \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.m: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In addition to the allegations of criminal conduct (Guideline J) in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c, cited above, the government alleged that, in August 2002, Applicant purchased for $250 with intent to transport 10 tablets of Ecstacy, and that she subsequently transported same from Florida to South Carolina (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that she illegally According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse web page (http://www.nida.nih.gov), ecstacy 5 (methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA) is a synthetic, psychoactive drug that is chemically similar to the stimulant methamphetamine and the hallucinogen mescaline. It produces an energizing effect as well as feelings of euphoria, emotional warmth, and distortions in time perception and tactile experiences. MDMA is taken orally as a capsule or tablet. It was initially popular among adolescents and young adults in the nightclub scene or at weekend-long dance parties known as raves. This person was working with local police as an informant to gain favor after she herself was arrested for a 6 drug-related offense. (Gx. 2) 3 used marijuana in June 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The government cross-alleged the same conduct as involvement with illegal drugs (Guideline H) in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.e.

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance is granted.\nOn August 24, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for her job with\na defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a set of interrogatories to obtain clarification of and/or additional\ninformation about adverse information in her background.  After reviewing the results of\n1\nthe background investigation, including her response to the interrogatories (Gx. 2),\nDOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is\n2\nDecember 30, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n My file did not contain a copy of Applicant\u2019s request for hearing. However, at hearing, Department Counsel\n4\nproduced his copy of Applicant\u2019s request, and Applicant confirmed she had requested a hearing as part of her\nresponse to the SOR.\n2\nclearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant access to classified\ninformation. On July 11, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline J (criminal conduct) and Guideline H\n3\n(drug involvement).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was\n4\nassigned to me on September 9, 2008, and I convened a hearing on October 21, 2008.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented three exhibits (Gx. 1 -\n3). Applicant testified and submitted one exhibit (Ax. A). DOHA received the transcript of\nhearing (Tr.) on November 5, 2008. \nProcedural Issue.\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR based on evidence presented at\nthe hearing. Applicant did not object to the motion. I also made changes to the SOR to\ncorrect typographical errors. (Directive, E3.1.17; Tr. 16 - 19, 55 - 59) As a result, SOR \u00b6\n1 has been amended to read as follows:\n\u201ca. On or about September 2006, in Charleston, South Carolina, you were\ncharged with Possession with Intent to Distribute (PWD) Cocaine. As of April 29,\n2008, disposition in this case is pending.\nb. On or about August 2006, you were arrested in or around Charleston, South\nCarolina and charged with Simple Possession of Marijuana. You spent one night\nin jail and were released on a bond in the approximate amount of $465.00. As of\nApril 29, 2008, disposition in this case is pending.\nc. In approximately August 2002, you were arrested in or around Charleston,\nSouth Carolina and charged with Distribution of Ecstacy. After completing a five-\nmonth pre-trial intervention program, the charge was dismissed on approximately\nMay 6, 2003.\u201d\nFindings of Fact\nIn addition to the allegations of criminal conduct (Guideline J) in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -\n1.c, cited above, the government alleged that, in August 2002, Applicant purchased for\n$250 with intent to transport 10 tablets of Ecstacy, and that she subsequently\ntransported same from Florida to South Carolina (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that she illegally\n\n According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse web page (http://www.nida.nih.gov), ecstacy\n5\n(methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA) is a synthetic, psychoactive drug that is chemically similar to\nthe stimulant methamphetamine and the hallucinogen mescaline. It produces an energizing effect as well as\nfeelings of euphoria, emotional warmth, and distortions in time perception and tactile experiences. MDMA is\ntaken orally as a capsule or tablet. It was initially popular among adolescents and young adults in the nightclub\nscene or at weekend-long dance parties known as raves. \n This person was working with local police as an informant to gain favor after she herself was arrested for a\n6\ndrug-related offense. (Gx. 2)\n3\nused marijuana in June 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The government cross-alleged the same\nconduct as involvement with illegal drugs (Guideline H) in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.e. Although\nshe did not specifically answer the SOR \u00b6 2 allegations, her answers to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -\n1.e apply to SOR \u00b6 2. (Tr. 11 - 13) Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.b - 1.e, but denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. I have also made the following\nadditional findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 25 years old and employed as a logistics manager by a defense\ncontractor. She was hired by her employer in September 2006 as a stock clerk and has\nbeen steadily promoted during her tenure there. (Gx. 1; Tr. 51 - 52) Applicant graduated\nfrom high school in 2001. Her one and only use of illegal drugs was a single use of\nmarijuana in June 2001 around the time she graduated. In July 2001, she got married,\nbut the relationship turned abusive and she left her husband in December 2001. A\ndivorce was finalized in September 2006. In her e-QIP, she indicated she did not know\nher ex-husband\u2019s whereabouts because of a restraining order in place against him. (Gx.\n1; Tr. 44)\nIn January 2002, Applicant enrolled in a South Carolina college to complete\ndegree studies she had started at a community college while she was still living with her\nex-husband. In August 2002, Applicant was visiting a friend in Florida. A college friend,\nwhom Applicant had known only a short time, called Applicant and asked her to\nparticipate in a drug deal. Applicant agreed to meet a third party, obtain 10 tablets of\necstacy,  an illegal drug, and bring the drugs back to South Carolina. Applicant did so,\n5\nand when she met her friend  she was arrested and charged with Distribution of\n6\nEcstacy, a violation of South Carolina law. Because Applicant was not the major drug\nsource the police were looking for, she was able to reach an agreement with\nprosecutors to avoid trial. Applicant completed a pre-trial diversion program, which\nresulted in dismissal of the charges and expungement of the matter from her record in\nJuly 2003. (Gx. 2; Tr. 33 - 35, 45 - 46)\nOn August 5, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with simple possession\nof marijuana (28 grams or less). She had been on a boat with her then-boyfriend and\nthree other people. All five people aboard had bags in which they carried personal\nitems, snacks, and so on. At some point, Department of Natural Resources police\npatrolling the area stopped the boat Applicant was in. A search of the boat ensued and\na small amount of marijuana was found in one of the five bags. The owner of the boat\ntook responsibility for the drugs. However, when the boat returned to shore the police\ndecided to charge everyone with possession of marijuana. No drugs were found in\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n7\n4\nApplicant\u2019s bag or on her person. Nor was anyone using drugs while on the boat. (Gx.\n2; Tr. 35 - 43, 47 - 48)\nThe August 2006 drug possession charge was still pending as of Applicant\u2019s\nhearing in this matter. She has never had to appear in court to answer this charge. An\nOctober 15, 2008, letter from her attorney to the presiding judge indicated that the\ncharge will likely be disposed of through Applicant\u2019s plea of guilty to a charge of\ndisorderly conduct. The drug charge would then be dismissed. (Ax. A) At one point\nduring the pendency of the drug charge, Applicant was told by her attorney that police\nhad obtained a direct indictment, that is, an indictment by a grand jury without a\npreliminary hearing on the charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.\nApplicant saw the police find marijuana during the search but never saw them find any\ncocaine. (Tr. 38, 47 - 48)\nWhen Applicant submitted her e-QIP, she answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 23(a)\n(Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?) and listed a\nSeptember 2006 direct indictment for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.\n(Gx. 1) When she responded to the DOHA interrogatories in April 2008, she answered\nquestion #7 (Have you ever been arrested, charged, or held by any law enforcement\nauthorities for any reason?) in the affirmative. She listed her 2002 arrest for ecstacy\ndistribution, her 2002 arrest for marijuana possession, and a possession of cocaine with\nintent to distribute charge. (Gx. 2) At her hearing, she testified that she listed the\ncocaine charge because of what her attorney had told her. In another part of her\nresponse to interrogatories, Applicant further stated that she and her attorney had not\nreceived any paperwork about the cocaine charge. The government has presented no\nindependent evidence showing Applicant has ever been charged with a cocaine-related\noffense. The FBI arrest record presented as Gx. 3 lists only the August 2006 marijuana\ncharge. Applicant\u2019s attorney has since told her that there was no indictment for cocaine\npossession. Having heard Applicant\u2019s testimony on this matter, including her responses\non cross-examination and to questions from the bench (Tr. 28, 38 - 39, 43 - 44, 48 - 50),\nand having considered the government\u2019s argument in support of the allegations in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a, I specifically find as fact that Applicant was not charged with any\ncocaine-related offense. \nSince her 2002 arrest, Applicant has disassociated herself from people who use\ndrugs. She testified credibly that she was unaware her boyfriend was involved with\ndrugs until they were arrested in September 2006. Thereafter, she threw him out.\nApplicant lives a stable lifestyle. She owns her own home and is active in the\ncommunity through volunteer work with a crisis hotline, the SPCA, and the Girl Scouts.\n(Tr. 31)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,7\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n8\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n10\n5\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 24 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) and AG \u00b6 30 (Guideline J - Criminal\nConduct).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n8\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n9\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.10\n\n6\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct.\nThe government\u2019s information does not support the controverted allegation in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to\ndistribute. While the SOR allegation was made in good faith based on Applicant\u2019s\ndisclosures in her e-QIP and in her response to DOHA interrogatories, no other\nindependent evidence of the alleged conduct was presented by the government. All\navailable information bearing on this allegation shows Applicant, based on what she had\nbeen told by her attorney at the time, was simply being candid, albeit misinformed, in\nresponse to the government\u2019s questions. However, as to the remaining allegations of\ncriminal conduct, the government presented sufficient information to show Applicant had\nused an illegal substance in 2001, that she had bought and transported interstate an\nillegal drug in 2002, conduct for which she was arrested, charged and convicted in\n2002, and that she was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana in 2006.\nThe foregoing raises a security concern addressed in AG \u00b6 30 (criminal conduct); to wit:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nMore specifically, Applicant\u2019s conduct requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions at AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and AG \u00b6\n31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). However, as to the 2006 marijuana\ncharge that is still pending after more than two years and is likely to be disposed of\nthrough a plea deal, the record supports a conclusion that Applicant did not possess\nmarijuana as alleged and likely has not used marijuana or any other illegal substance\nsince 2001. As to her 2002 arrest and conviction, this appears to be her most recent\ncriminal activity. Owing to the passage of time and positive information about her\nlifestyle since then, this offense does not currently reflect adversely on her judgment\nand she is not likely to engage in such conduct in the future. The foregoing requires\napplication of the mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 32 (a) (so much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), AG \u00b6 32(c) (evidence that the person did\nnot commit the offense) and AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement). On balance, I conclude the security concerns\npresented by the government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct are\nmitigated.\nDrug Involvement.\nAs alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.d and 2.e, the government presented sufficient\ninformation to show that Applicant used marijuana once in 2001 and that she bought,\n\n7\npossessed and transported ecstacy in 2002. For the reasons noted above, there is no\nsupport for the SOR \u00b6 2.a allegation that Applicant possessed or intended to distribute\ncocaine. Nor does it appear that she possessed marijuana in 2006 as alleged through\nSOR \u00b6 2.b. Nonetheless, the government\u2019s information raises a security concern\naddressed in AG \u00b6 24 as follows:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and\nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g.,\nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and\nhallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse (see definition [at AG \u00b6 25(a)]) and AG\n\u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia). By contrast,\navailable information shows Applicant\u2019s last knowing involvement with illegal drugs was\nin August 2002. She was unaware until a police stop and search that anyone she was\nwith on the boat in August 2006 was involved with illegal drugs. Indeed, when she\nbecame aware that her boyfriend used drugs, she ended their relationship. She has not\nknowingly associated with anyone who uses drugs since 2002. \nAvailable information requires application of the mitigating conditions listed at AG\n\u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) dissociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence...). Having considered all of the\ninformation bearing on the allegations under this guideline, including positive information\nabout her current lifestyle, I conclude the security concerns presented by the\ngovernment\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s drug involvement are mitigated.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines H and J. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 25 years\n\n See footnote 7, supra.\n11\n8\nold and presumed to be a mature adult. She has worked in the same job for just over\ntwo years and has been promoted steadily, ostensibly as a result of her reliability. Her\nemployment record does not reflect periods of unemployment that might be\ncharacteristic of someone with a drug problem or who is prone to criminal conduct. She\nlives a stable lifestyle as a homeowner and community volunteer. Having observed her\ndemeanor at hearing, I found her credible and her testimony devoid of any evasiveness\nor attempts to avoid responsibility for her actions. The facts and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct and drug involvement no longer present an unacceptable\nrisk to the national interest were she to be given access to classified information. A fair\nand commonsense assessment  of all available information shows Applicant has\n11\novercome the doubts about her ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s\ninterests as her own raised by the adverse information in her background.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.) and one allegation under AG H, Drug Involvement (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the three allegations under AG E and the one allegation under AG H. In his Answer, he provided additional information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (Answer to SOR; Ex. 1; Ex. 3.) Applicant was born in July 1989, and, on the date of his hearing, he was 19 years old. He has completed one year of university studies and plans to major in Management Information Systems. He is unmarried and resides with his parents when he is not pursuing his university studies. (Ex. 1; Tr. 5-6, 22-23.) While he was a high school student and before leaving to attend a university in another state, Applicant was employed as a laptop administrator by a federal contractor. Applicant\u2019s father was also employed by the federal contractor and was Applicant\u2019s supervisor. Applicant stated his father wanted him to work for the federal contractor so he could gain experience in computer technology. Applicant began his employment with the federal contractor in May 2006, when he was sixteen years old. (Ex. 1; Tr. 24-25, 38.)

His eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) Questionnaire on August 10, 2007. On May 22, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline H, \nDrug Involvement. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nIn an undated document, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July \n18, 2008. I convened a hearing on August 4, 2008, to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced three exhibits, which \nwere marked Ex. 1 through 3 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and called no witnesses.  He did not introduce exhibits.   \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open for one week, until close of \nbusiness August 11, 2008, so that Applicant could provide additional information for the \nrecord.  Applicant did not file any additional information, and I closed the record on \nAugust 12, 2008.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on August 12, 2008. \n \n                                          Procedural Matters \n \nApplicant was apprised of the 15-day notice provision specified in Enclosure 3, \u00b6 \nE3.1.8.  He voluntarily and knowingly elected to waive the 15-day notice provision in \norder to appear earlier for his hearing.  He stated he understood the effect of the waiver \nshould he be the unsuccessful party in this matter and elect to file an appeal. (Tr. 10-\n12.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG E, \nPersonal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.) and one allegation under AG H, Drug \nInvolvement (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the three \nallegations under AG E and the one allegation under AG H.  In his Answer, he provided \nadditional information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (Answer \nto SOR; Ex. 1; Ex. 3.)  \n \n \nApplicant was born in July 1989, and, on the date of his hearing, he was 19 years \nold. He has completed one year of university studies and plans to major in Management \nInformation Systems.  He is unmarried and resides with his parents when he is not \npursuing his university studies.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 5-6, 22-23.) \n \n \nWhile he was a high school student and before leaving to attend a university in \nanother state, Applicant was employed as a laptop administrator by a federal contractor. \nApplicant\u2019s father was also employed by the federal contractor and was Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor.  Applicant stated his father wanted him to work for the federal contractor so \nhe could gain experience in computer technology. Applicant began his employment with \nthe federal contractor in May 2006, when he was sixteen years old. (Ex. 1; Tr. 24-25, \n38.) \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana once when he was fifteen years old and in the 10th \ngrade in high school. He used marijuana for the second time when he was sixteen years \nold and in the 11th grade of high school.  Between the ages of 16 and 18, Applicant \n\n \n3 \n \n \nused marijuana about every three or four months.  His last use of marijuana occurred in \nSeptember 2007, when he was a college freshman.  Applicant claims he has not used \nmarijuana since September 2007. (Ex. 2; Ex. 3; Tr. 46-56.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were both in the military, and the family moved often.  \nApplicant stated that when he was 16, 17, and 18, he felt like an outcast.  He explained \nhis drug use in part by stating that he tried very hard to fit in with other young people his \nage.  (Tr. 52-54.) \n \n \nAt his father\u2019s suggestion, Applicant completed an e-QIP application for a \nsecurity clearance sometime in the summer of 2005, when he was still 15 years old.1  \nHe signed the application electronically and printed it, but he did not file it with a security \nofficer.  He testified he kept it in a file he had at home. (Tr. 29-30, 50-51, 58-59.) \n \n \nQuestion 24a on the e-QIP reads: \n \nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you \nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, \ncrack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.) \namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.) hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs? \n \nQuestion 24b on the e-QIP reads: \n \nHave you ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a \nlaw enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official, while \npossessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and \nimmediately affecting the public safety? \n \nQuestion 24c reads: \n \nIn the last 7 years, have you been involved in the illegal purchase, \nmanufacture, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, or sale \nof any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, or cannabis for your \nown intended profit or that of another? \n \n \nBy the time he completed the e-QIP in the summer of 2005, Applicant had used \nmarijuana. However, he interpreted Question 24a to apply only to individuals who were \n16 years of age or older. Since he was not yet 16, he responded \u201cno\u201d to Question 24a, \nthereby denying any illegal drug use.  He also answered \u201cno\u201d to Questions 24b and 24c. \nThe record does not reflect that Applicant held a security clearance when he used \nmarijuana. At his hearing, Applicant denied purchasing marijuana or contributing to its \npurchase.  (Tr. 31, 34-35.) \n \n                                            \n1 Applicant turned 16 in the third week of July 2005. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant completed and certified another e-QIP in August 2007.  He again \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to Questions 24a, 24b, and 24c. He did not update his response to \nQuestion 24a to reflect his behavior with drugs since 2005. He testified that he \nanswered \u201cno\u201d on his 2007 e-QIP because he was using his 2005 e-QIP for reference \nand, without being aware of the nature of the questions, simply repeated his 2005 \nresponses.  (Tr. 26-32.) \n \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant again used marijuana. He did not admit any of his \nmarijuana use until interviewed by an authorized investigator in November 2007. \nApplicant stated he did not intend to use illegal drugs in the future.  He said he used \nillegal drugs in the past because he was influenced by peer pressure. He stated that \nsince September 2007, he was spending time on sports activities and his studies and \nwas avoiding venues where drugs were used.  (Ex. 3; Tr. 32-34, 39-41, 554-56.)   \n \n \nApplicant told his parents about his illegal drug use in the spring of 2008. He said \nhe would provide a copy of his 2005 e-QIP for the record, but he failed to do so.  (Tr. \n50-52, 57.) \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nWhen Appellant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 24a on the e-QIP that he signed and \ncertified in August 2007, he had been using marijuana, an illegal drug, for about four \nyears. Approximately one month after completing and certifying his e-QIP, Applicant \nused marijuana again. In his interview with an authorized investigator in November \n2007, he admitted his drug use. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted falsifying \nmaterial facts in his answer to Question 24a. This information raises security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 16(a) and AG \u00b6 16(e)(1).  \n \n AG \u00b6 16(a) reads: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) reads: \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of \ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmanipulation, or duress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect \nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d  \n \nI have carefully reviewed all the applicable Guideline E mitigating conditions, and \nI have especially reviewed AG \u00b6 17(a) and AG \u00b6 17(e).  AG 17(a) reads: \u201cthe individual \nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts.\u201d AG 17(e) reads: \u201cthe individual has taken \npositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress.\u201d Applicant falsified his answer to Question 24a on the e-QIP he signed and \ncertified on August 10, 2007. He did not make a prompt good-faith attempt to correct the \nfalsification. The falsification was brought to his attention in his security interview in \nNovember 2007. While Applicant claims he has stopped using marijuana, increased his \nsports activities, and sharpened his focus on his university studies, it is not clear that \nthese recent actions, while positive, will reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress.  I conclude that AG \u00b617(a) does not apply to the \nfacts of Applicant\u2019s case.  I also conclude that AG 17(e) applies only in part. \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.  AG \u00b6 24(a), defines drugs as \u201cmood and behavior altering \nsubstances.\u201d  The definition of drugs includes \u201c(1) drugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), \nand (2) inhalants and other similar substances.\u201d AG  \u00b6 24(b) defines drug abuse as \u201cthe \nillegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction.\u201d \n \nThe relevant Guideline H security concern in this case is referenced at AG \u00b6 \n25(a) of the Drug Involvement guideline.  The record shows that Applicant\u2019s admitted \nillegal marijuana use began in about 2004, when he was 15 years old and continued \nuntil 2007, when he was 18 years old.  He used illegal drugs while employed by a \nfederal contractor and after applying for a security clearance. This conduct casts doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  It also raises security concerns \nabout his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  I conclude \nthat Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use raises security concerns under Guideline H. \n \nSeveral Guideline H mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If Applicant\u2019s drug use happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, then AG \u00b6 26(a) might be \napplicable in mitigation.  If Applicant demonstrated an intent not to abuse any drugs in \nthe future by disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts, changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used, abstaining from drug use for an \n\n \n7 \n \n \nappropriate period, or signing a statement of intent with the automatic revocation of his \nsecurity clearance for any violation, then AG \u00b6 26(b) might be applicable.  \n \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s drug use is recent: it began when he was in \nhigh school and continued into his first year as a university student.  While Applicant \nstated he had not used marijuana since September 2007, he failed to provide evidence \ncorroborating his statement that his abstinence would continue. Applicant stated he had \nchanged his behavior and activities after his last use of marijuana in September 2007 \nand his subsequent decision to abstain from illegal drugs. However, these decisions are \nrecent and of insufficient duration to demonstrate a positive and permanent change in \nbehavior. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not apply in mitigation to the \nsecurity concerns raised by the facts in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young and immature \nperson. He admitted marijuana use that began when he was a teen-ager and continued \nwhile he was a college student. He was concerned about being accepted by his peers, \nand he attributed his drug use to peer pressure. His explanation for his failure to \ndelineate his drug use on the e-QIP he executed and certified in August 2007 was not \ncredible. Applicant failed to demonstrate that his illegal conduct was unlikely to recur.   \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions about Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance.  In all adjudications, the protection of our national \nsecurity is the paramount concern.  Security clearance decisions are not intended to \nassign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions.  Rather, the \nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common sense \n\n \n8 \n \n \nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified \ninformation.  Indeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person \nby the totality of his acts and omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating \nconduct. Having done so, and giving full consideration to the nature of Applicant\u2019s \nconduct, I find he does not merit a security clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have \nconsidered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in \nthe Directive.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from his drug involvement and personal conduct.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c: Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 30-year-old information technology systems security analyst working for a government contractor. She completed high school in 1997, and through the years has taken some college courses. In 2005, she received a systems administration network management certification (GE 1).

Her evidence is \ninsufficient to show that she is in control of her finances and she lacks a track record of \nfinancial responsibility. She failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 9, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions or \nStandard Form (SF) 86.1 On September 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n \n1  GE 1.  \n \nFebruary 12, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                                          \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be denied or revoked. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 13, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 4, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 9, 2008. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on December 29, 2008. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) \n1 through 5, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 28). Applicant testified on her \nown behalf, and presented one exhibit, marked Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1, which was \nadmitted without objection (Tr. 31). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nJanuary 6, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the financial allegations under SOR \u00b6 1, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.e, which she denied. She challenged some of the admitted allegations \nbecause they were duplicates (See infra p. 3). Her admissions are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old information technology systems security analyst \nworking for a government contractor. She completed high school in 1997, and through \nthe years has taken some college courses. In 2005, she received a systems \nadministration network management certification (GE 1).  \n \nShe enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1997, and served honorably until April 2002, \nwhen she was discharged. She is currently serving in the Army Reserve as a sergeant, \npay grade E-5 (Tr. 44). She received access to classified information at the secret level \nin 1998 while she was on active duty (Tr. 7). She has continuously held a security \nclearance to the day of her hearing. She also received access to classified information \nat the top secret level from another government agency (Tr. 46). There is no evidence \nto show that she has compromised or caused others to compromise classified \ninformation. Nor is there evidence showing that she has ever failed to follow the rules \nand procedures required to handle classified information. In 1998, she received non-\njudicial punishment for driving while intoxicated. Except for this incident, she has no \npolice record, and there is no evidence she has used or trafficked in illegal drugs. \n \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant has been continuously employed since 2002 (Tr. 92-94). Although she \nhas worked for numerous employers, her job progression shows continuous \nprofessional development, highlighted by a substantial increase of her yearly salary. In \nher first job after leaving the Army her salary was approximately $38,000 a year. She \nleft that job for another job paying $45,000 a year. In her next job (as a security analyst), \nshe earned $55,000 during the first six months, and then, her salary was increased to \n$65,000. She then moved to a job paying $68,000. In November 2006, she changed to \na job paying $85,000 a year. Around January 2008, she was hired by her current \nemployer and has been earning approximately $95,000 a year. \n \nApplicant married in May 1997, and was divorced in March 1998. She had no \nchildren of this marriage. She has two children, ages seven and three conceived out of \nwedlock. Applicant has custody of her two children. She receives almost no financial \nsupport from the father of her children. She has taken no legal action to force him to \nprovide support for his children. She met the father of her children while in the Army, \nand they have been engaged to be married and living together on and off through the \nyears. He is currently unemployed. She believes he is doing all that he can do under the \ncircumstances to provide financial assistance to her children.  \n \n \nIn her May 2007 security clearance application (GE 1), Applicant disclosed that \nshe had been delinquent on numerous debts. Applicant\u2019s background investigation \naddressed her financial situation and included the review of her SF 86; her responses to \nDOHA interrogatories (GE 3); and two credit bureau reports (CBRs) (GEs 2 & 4).  \n \nThe SOR alleges 27 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately \n$19,000. Applicant admitted most of the debts alleged in SOR are her debts and have \nbeen delinquent for many years. Applicant explained that her financial problems were \ncaused by a combination of factors; i.e., her abuse of her credit because she was young \nand immature; she is a single mother and sole provider for her two children; her children \nreceive almost no financial support from their father; the expenses associated with her \nmany moves due to her change of jobs; and her lack of financial responsibility (Tr. 34).  \n \nConsidering the record as a whole I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.z alleged the \nsame debt in collection by different collection agencies. I also find the following SOR \nallegations are duplicates of the same debt: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.o; 1.j and 1.m; and, 1.n \nand 1.p. Applicant also claimed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l are alleged as one debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.aa. She did not presented documentary evidence to establish this last claim. She \nadmitted the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q; however, she is disputing the total amount of \nthe debt. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.e, claimed she paid the debt and she disputed it. She \npresented no evidence to support these claims about SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.q. \n \nIn early 2003, she participated in a debt consolidation/settlement program (Tr. \n35). After a couple of months, she stopped participating because the consolidation \nprogram was not working well. She was making payments, but could not see any \nprogress in the settlement or payment of her debts. She also claimed she took a part-\n\n \n \n4 \n \ntime job to increase her income and pay her delinquent debts. She had to quit her part-\ntime job because she was not able to work two jobs and take care of her children. \n \nAround March-April 2007, Applicant entered into a gestational carrier contract \nseeking additional income to pay her delinquent debts without taking time away from \nher children (Tr. 23). She anticipated earning approximately $20,000 in nine months; \nhowever, she had a miscarriage and did not earn any money (Tr. 23, 39). In September \n2008, Applicant entered into a second gestational carrier contract (AE 1). At the time of \nthe hearing, she was pregnant pursuant to her gestational carrier contract, and believed \nshe would start earning approximately $2,000 a month in January 2009 (Tr. 24). \nApplicant promised to use all her earnings from the contract ($20,000) to pay her \ndelinquent debts (Tr. 40). She also wants to clean up her credit to purchase a home for \nher children (Tr. 42). \n \nAs of her hearing day, not one of the debts listed in the SOR have been paid or \nresolved (Tr. 58). Applicant testified she paid other small debts first (not alleged in the \nSOR). She intends to pay her large delinquent debts with the anticipated gestational \ncarrier contract earnings. Outside of her 2003 participation on the debt \nconsolidation/settlement program and her two gestational carrier contracts, Applicant \npresented little evidence of efforts to contact creditors, settle, resolve, or to dispute her \ndebts (Tr. 72, 90).  \n \nWhen asked why she made no effort to resolve her delinquent debts, Applicant \nexplained she convinced herself she did not have sufficient money to pay her debts. \nShe did not want to spend the money because she was afraid something else would go \nwrong (Tr. 91). Applicant wanted her children to grow up in a nice, quiet neighborhood. \nWith additional income earned, she chose to live in the nicer places, and consequently, \nthe higher her expenses (Tr. 105). This resulted in her not having the money to pay her \ndelinquent debts. \n \nApplicant claimed to follow a monthly financial budget, prepared by her with the \nassistance of her dad. Her current yearly gross income is approximately $98,000 (Tr. \n76). Her monthly expenses total approximately $4,630 (GE 3). Applicant appears to \nhave a $360 remainder after paying her monthly expenses. Except for her participation \nin the 2003 debt consolidation/settlement program, Applicant did not seek or participate \nin any financial counseling. \n \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse for her past financial problems. She has \nlearned her lesson and she is now well aware of what it is required of her to show that \nshe is reliable, trustworthy, and financially responsible. She is very concerned about the \nadverse impact loosing her security clearance will have on her family and her career. \nHer plan is to pay all her delinquent debts with the income from her gestational carrier \ncontract. She noted her military service and her good performance for government \ncontractors, and that she is considered a responsible and reliable employee.  \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                                          \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d3 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4 \n \n \n3  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n4  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is well documented in her credit reports, her SOR \nresponse, her response to the DOHA interrogatories, and her testimony. Since around \n2000, she acquired numerous debts which became delinquent and have remained \noutstanding for many years. As of the hearing date, she had 21 outstanding debts \ntotaling approximately $17,500. The government established the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                                          \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,5 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant presented little evidence of efforts taken to contact \ncreditors, or to resolve any of the debts since she acquired them. Nor is there any \nevidence that she has participated in meaningful financial counseling.   \n \nI specifically considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 20(b) \nand conclude it applies, but only to a limited extent. Applicant\u2019s testimony established \nfactors that may be considered as circumstances beyond her control contributing to her \ninability to pay her debts, i.e., being a single mother and sole provider for her children, \nthe lack of financial assistance from her children\u2019s father; her failed relationship; the \nexpenses associated with her many moves due to her change of jobs; and her \nunsuccessful attempt to earn additional funds from her gestational carrier contract.  \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she has dealt \nresponsibly with her financial obligations before, or after receipt of the SOR. Applicant \nhas been consistently employed since 1997. Since leaving the Army she has \nsubstantially increased her earnings from around $40,000 a year in 2003 to $98,000 a \nyear in 2008. Nevertheless, she presented little evidence to show paid debts, \nsettlements, documented negotiations, completed payment plans, or meaningful \nfinancial assistance/counseling with respect to her SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s financial \nhistory and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that she has established a \ntrack record of financial responsibility, or that she has taken control of her financial \nsituation.  \n \n \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at \n4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered as \na whole. \n\n \n \n8 \n \nI considered that Applicant entered into a gestational carrier contract and that \nshe promised to use her anticipated income from it to pay her delinquent debts. \nApplicant\u2019s promises to pay her debts in a future day, however, are not sufficient to \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. As mentioned above, she has \nsubstantially increased her earnings during the last five years and she took little action \nto resolve her delinquent financial obligations. Applicant\u2019s current financial track record \ndoes not provide any assurance that she will act responsibly with her anticipated \nearnings.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). \nApplicant\u2019s honorable service in the Army and her years working for government \ncontractors and holding a security clearance weigh in her favor. There is no evidence to \nshow that she has compromised or caused others to compromise classified information. \nNor is there evidence showing that she has ever failed to follow the rules and \nprocedures required to handle classified information. Other than a DWI offense, she has \nno police record, and there is no evidence she has used or trafficked in illegal drugs. \nAside from her delinquent debts (which are a civil, non-criminal issue), she is a law-\nabiding citizen, a concerned daughter, and a caring mother. She expressed regrets for \nher financial mistakes and claimed she is trying to correct them.  \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in her case, including Applicant\u2019s \nage, education, and maturity, she demonstrated a lack of judgment and trustworthiness \nin the handling of her financial affairs. She failed to deal responsibly with her financial \nobligations. Her failure or inability to live within her means and to meet her financial \nobligations indicates poor self-control.  \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n  \n \n \n  \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \n \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.m, \n  \n \n 1.o, 1.p, and 1.z:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.d-1.l, \n  \n \n1.n, 1.q-1.y, and 1.aa - 1.cc : \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJuan J. Rivera \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 8, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 7, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Jennifer I. Goldstein denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\n\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge:\n1) erred in concluding that Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his indebtedness were insufficient to\nmitigate the government\u2019s security concerns, and 2) failed to accept his explanation as to why his\nomission of information from his Security Clearance Application (SCA) was not deliberate and\nintentional.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious or contrary to law.\nOn appeal, Applicant submits a credit report which post-dates the Judge\u2019s decision by three\nweeks and was not part of the record evidence.  The Board cannot consider this new evidence.  See\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as\na whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice\nversa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  In this case, the Judge\nfound that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial obligations.  At the time the case\nwas submitted for decision, Applicant still had significant outstanding debts, and was still trying to\nresolve his financial problems. Although some of his outstanding debts had been paid, his actions\nhad not been timely, and two of the debts had been paid involuntarily through garnishment. Decision\nat 7.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The\nJudge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of\nthe disqualifying conduct, considered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.\nWhile she found in favor of Applicant as to several of the SOR factual allegations, she reasonably\nexplained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nWith respect to the falsification of Applicant\u2019s SCA, the Judge specifically considered\nApplicant\u2019s explanations for why he failed to disclose the information in question.  Decision at 2-3,\n12.  However, the Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject that explanation.\nRather, the Judge considered that explanation in light of the record evidence as a whole, including\nhis statement that he had failed to disclose his outstanding debts because he was embarrassed, and\nconcluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions were deliberate and\nintentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is sustainable.  See\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes\nthat the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting\nBurlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

He is alleged to be \nindebted to 7 creditors in the approximate amount of $26,136. In addition, it is alleged \nthat he falsified his June 24, 2009 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (EQIP). Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security \nconcerns because he has failed to show he acted responsibly with respect to his \noutstanding debts. He did not mitigate the Personal Conduct security concerns created \nby his intentional omission of his outstanding debts from his EQIP. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 8, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n\n \n2 \n \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 21, 2010, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 3, 2010. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on June 7, 2010, scheduling the hearing for July 22, 2010. On July 22, \n2010, Applicant did not appear. However, he contacted the DOHA office and orally \nrequested a continuance based upon his hospitalization the day of the hearing and \nsubsequent treatment for his medical condition. He provided documentation that he was \nin the emergency room on July 22, 2010, and therefore unable to attend as scheduled. \nApplicant\u2019s request for a new hearing date was granted, and the hearing was \nrescheduled on August 12, 2010, a date after his medical treatment concluded. His \nhearing was held on September 28, 2010, as scheduled. The Government offered \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 11, which were admitted without objection. The Applicant \noffered Exhibits (AE) A through W, which were all admitted without objection. Applicant \ncalled two witnesses, and testified on his own behalf. The record was left open for \nApplicant to submit additional exhibits and on October 12, 2010, Applicant presented a \n21 page submission, marked AE X through AE CC. Department Counsel had no \nobjections to AE X through CC and the exhibits were admitted. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 14, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.g. He denies \nallegations 1.a., 1.c., 1.h., 2.a., and 2.b. Allegation 1.f. was omitted from the SOR \nthrough a typographical error. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served in the \nArmy from 1988 to 1991 and from 2000 to 2004. He received an honorable discharge in \n1991, and an honorable discharge for medical reasons, after he was diagnosed with \nthree bulging disks, in 2004. He was married from 2000 to 2004, and has a 21-year-old \nson from that marriage. In 2004, he divorced. He is now engaged to the mother of his \ntwo additional children, ages two and five. (GE 1; GE 3; AE B; Tr. 39-51.) \n \n \nIn April 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance for the first time. He did \nnot have a clearance while in the Army. On his April 2006 EQIP, he did not list any \ndebts over 180 days delinquent in the past 7 years or that he was currently over 90 \ndays past due on any debts when he completed section 28 of the application. In June \n2009, he was again asked to complete an EQIP. As alleged in SOR allegation 2.a., he \nindicated \u201cyes\u201d, he had debts over 180 days delinquent in the past 7 years and that he \nwas currently over 90 days past due on some debts in answer to section 26. However, \nhe only listed creditors with whom he had made payment arrangements or had satisfied \nthe account on this application. He failed to disclose any accounts that he was still \ndelinquent on. As alleged in SOR allegation 2.b., he also indicated he had not had any \nproperty repossessed in the past seven years. However, his vehicle had been \nrepossessed, as noted below. Applicant claims his omissions were unintentional. He \n\n \n3 \n \ndoes admit that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the existence of his debts. In fact, when he \ndiscussed omitting his debts during his subject interview, he admitted in his adopted \nwritten report of his subject interview that he told the investigator he failed to list his \ndebts because he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d and \u201cdid not know what to list because of his last \nexperience with his security clearance processing.\u201d As set out below, these answers \nwere incorrect. (GE 1; GE 3; GE 5; GE 10; Tr. 40-44, 90-93.) \n \nApplicant has experienced financial problems since 2000 or 2001. He is alleged \nto be indebted to 7 creditors in the approximate amount of $26,136. Each of these debts \ncan be found on credit reports dated May 2006, July 2009, March 2010, May 2010, and \nJuly 2010. (GE 2; GE 4; GE6; GE 7; GE 9.) \n \nApplicant attributes his debts to a series of events that began in approximately \n2000-2001. Applicant was serving in Kosovo during this timeframe. He sent money back \nto his wife to pay their bills, but his wife was diverting the funds to other means. He did \nnot have internet access or much opportunity to call his wife while deployed and he \nrelied on her to satisfy their accounts. When he returned from his deployment, he \ndiscovered he had a number of delinquent debts. Disputes over the debts eventually led \nApplicant and his wife to file for divorce. The divorce decree assigned half of the debts \nto each party. Applicant testified that he was unable to satisfy the debts assigned to \nhim, as he was unemployed for a year after leaving the Army. His EQIP shows that he \nwas unemployed from October 2008 through April 2009. His debts are as follows. (GE \n1; GE 3; Tr. 62-68.) \n \nApplicant was indebted on a judgment against him in the approximate amount of \n$348, as alleged in allegation 1.a. Applicant incurred this debt when he received an \noverpayment on his unemployment benefits. His wages were garnished to satisfy this \ndebt and it is now paid. Applicant produced an Acknowledgement of Satisfaction of \nJudgment as proof this debt is paid. (AE X; Tr. 72-73.) \n \nApplicant is indebted on a store credit card in the approximate amount of $3,137, \nas alleged in allegation 1.b. Applicant testified that his ex-wife incurred this debt when \nthey were married and it was assigned to Applicant in their divorce. However, in his \nadopted subject interview, he indicated that this debt was solely his debt, and he used \nthe card to purchase his children\u2019s school clothing. Applicant has reached a settlement \nagreement with this creditor. He agreed to make payments of $117.65 per month until \nhe has satisfied a reduced amount of $1,411.74. Applicant provided documentation \nfrom the creditor outlining their agreement and bank statements that show he made two \npayments, one in September 2010 and one in October 2010, under this plan. (GE 5; AE \nL; AE P; AE Y; Tr. 74-77.) \n \nApplicant was indebted to the Federal government for an overpayment he \nreceived when he was discharged from the Army in the approximate amount of $799, as \nstated in allegation 1.c. This debt was satisfied in February 2010 when Applicant\u2019s \nincome tax return was applied to this debt. Applicant presented a notification from the \nU.S. Department of Treasury that shows this debt was satisfied. (AE R; AE Z; Tr. 77-\n79.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant is indebted to a collection agent in the approximate amount of $19,767, \nas alleged in 1.d. This debt was incurred when Applicant surrendered a vehicle for \nrepossession. He purchased the vehicle in 2005 for approximately $26,000. He owned it \nfor two and one-half years. He made payments on the vehicle for the first two years, but \nwas unable to continue to afford the vehicle. He called the lender and surrendered it. He \nbelieves the vehicle was resold by the creditor for more than he owed on the vehicle at \nthe time of surrender. He has joined a class action law suit against the creditor. He also \nprovided documentation that he has hired a credit counseling company to negotiate with \nthis creditor on his behalf. To date, there is no agreement with this creditor. Applicant \ndisputes the full debt and has requested an accounting from the company, through the \ncredit counseling service. (AE BB; Tr. 79-83, 105-108, 113.) \n \nApplicant is indebted to a collection agent for a phone company in the \napproximate amount of $885, as alleged in 1.e. This debt was incurred when Applicant \nacquired cell phone service for his oldest child. At hearing, Applicant claimed this debt \nhad been paid. However, he was unable to provide documentation to establish \npayment. He indicated, in his post-hearing exhibits, that he has now listed this debt with \nhis consumer credit counseling service, but he provided no documentation to support \nthis claim. (AE T; AE Q; AE AA; Tr. 84-87.) \n \nApplicant is indebted to a collection agent for a bank in the approximate amount \nof $280, as alleged in 1.g. Applicant claims he satisfied this debt for a negotiated \namount of $183. He provided a copy a bank statement showing $183 had been \ndeducted from his bank account on April 28, 2010. However, neither the name of the \ncreditor paid, nor the amount paid match the original debt as stated in Applicant\u2019s credit \nreports. (AE BB; Tr. 87-90.) \n \nApplicant is indebted to a collection agent for a phone company in the \napproximate amount of $920, as alleged in 1.h. Applicant disputes this debt and claims \nit is a duplicate of the debt in SOR allegation 1.e. However, he offered no \ndocumentation to establish his claim. Applicant\u2019s credit reports show Applicant had two \ndifferent account numbers with this creditor, opened at different times. (Tr. 89-90.) \n \nIn August 2007, Applicant attended a course on personal financial management \noffered through his employer. It was an eight hour class and Applicant presented \ndocumentation that he successfully completed the training. Applicant has also been \nworking with the consumer credit counseling service, since March 2010, to manage his \ndebt. (AE CC; AE W; Tr. 96-97.)  \n \nApplicant is well respected by his supervisors, colleagues, fianc\u00e9e, and friends. \nEach speaks highly of Applicant\u2019s dedication and trustworthiness. He has completed a \nnumber of training courses through his present employer and is dedicated to his job. He \nalso has been awarded a number of certificates from his employer and medals by the \nArmy, including the Achievement Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Army \nService Ribbon, the Antarctic Deployment Ribbon, and the Kosovo Service Medal. (AE \nC;AE D; AE E; AE F; AE G; AE H; AE I; AE P; AE BB; Tr. 45-52.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concern under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nSince 2001, Applicant has not been financially solvent. He admits that he did not \nattempt to satisfy his debts until approximately 2008. In addition, he has a number of \ndebts that remain unsatisfied. The Government established the disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is \nrequired.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n\n \n7 \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not acted responsibly, or in a timely manner, to attempt to resolve \nhis delinquent debt. Of Applicant\u2019s seven debts listed in the SOR, Applicant is making \npayments on one debt as alleged in 1.b. Two debts, 1.a., and 1.c., have been paid \ninvoluntarily, through garnishment. He is disputing 1.d. He was unable to present proof \nthat he has satisfied or otherwise resolved 1.e., 1.g., and 1.h. His debt is current and \non-going. Applicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant application of AG \u00b6 20(a).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts may have been due, in part, to his ex-wife\u2019s mismanagement of \nmoney and their subsequent divorce, but he has had ample time to resolve his debts \nsince then. Further, while he suffered two periods of unemployment, the first in 2004-\n2005 and the second in 2008 through April 2009, he failed to demonstrate responsible \nbehavior toward his debts during his periods of employment. He has been employed \nwith his present employer since April 2009 and has made little progress on his debts \nlisted on the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially mitigating. \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence that in August 2007 he attended a financial \nmanagement class. What effect, if any, this class had on Applicant\u2019s finances is unclear, \nas he did not focus on repaying any of his debts until 2008. He indicated he has been \nworking with a consumer credit counseling service, since March 2010, however, his \nfinancial problems are not fully resolved or under control, despite having satisfied SOR \nallegations 1.a and 1.c., and successfully making two payments in the debt in 1.b. AG \u00b6 \n20(c) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant has made a good faith effort to satisfy the creditors in SOR allegation \n1.b. The same cannot be said for the debts in 1.a. and 1.c. On its face, satisfaction of a \ndebt through the involuntary establishment of a creditor\u2019s garnishment is not the same \nas, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.1 Further, as \npreviously noted, Applicant failed to provide documentation that 1.e., 1.g., and 1.h. have \nbeen resolved. AG \u00b6 20(d) only applies in part. \n \n \nApplicant disputes the legitimacy of his debt on his repossessed vehicle. He has \nenlisted the help of a consumer credit counseling service to dispute this debt. He has \npresented no evidence to substantiate a dispute with any of his other unsatisfied \ncreditors. AG \u00b6 20(e) is mitigating only with respect to allegation 1.d. \n \n                                                          \n1 ISCR Case No. 08-06058 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2009). \n\n \n8 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for the Personal Conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. \n \n \nApplicant failed to list his delinquent debts on his 2009 EQIP in Sections 26(b) \nand 26(m). He clearly knew he had debts that had not been resolved since his last \nsecurity interview and were over 180 days delinquent in the past 7 years and that he \nwas currently over 90 days past due on some debts. Additionally, he knew he had a \nvehicle repossessed. Yet, he chose not to include the debts on the EQIP because he \nwas embarrassed of them. This behavior indicates questionable judgment and \nuntrustworthiness. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \n\n \n9 \n \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined above in AG \u00b6 17, it is \napparent that none of them apply. Applicant did not make prompt or good-faith efforts to \ncorrect his falsification or concealment. He provided no information that indicates he \nwas ill-advised in completing his SF 86. Falsifying information is a serious offense and \nApplicant has done nothing to show that similar lapses in judgment are unlikely to recur. \nFurther, he fails to take responsibility for his actions. He has not provided information in \nthis record to show that he has met his burden of proof for his personal conduct. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \n\n \n10 \n \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is well respected by his supervisors, friends, colleagues, and fianc\u00e9e. \nHe has honorably served in the U.S. Army. Those who know him best report that he has \na high degree of honor and trustworthiness. His standards are reflected in the \ncertificates he received during his employment with the government contractor and in \nthe Army. However, he has not acted in a trustworthy manner when it comes to \naddressing his financial delinquencies or in completing his EQIP.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations and Personal \nConduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on January 18, 2006 (Item 3).  On July 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns for financial considerations under Guideline F (Item 1).  The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 30, 2008, admitting all of the \nallegations.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on August 30, \n2008.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on September 17, \n2008, and was provided the opportunity to file objections, and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant did not respond to the \nFORM or provide additional material.  The case was assigned to me on November 19, \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 3, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2008.  Based on a review of the case file and pleadings, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 46 years old and has been a senior janitor maintenance employee of \na defense contractor since December 2005.  Prior to his employment with the defense \ncontractor, he was employed for over 18 years as a warehouse manager.  After leaving \nemployment as a warehouse manager, he was unemployed for a month and worked as \na farm hand for a month before starting with the defense contractor.  He is married with \ntwo teenager children.  He also served on active duty with the Air Force for four years \n(Item 3, e-QIP).   \n \nWhen employed as a warehouse manager, Applicant stated his salary was about \n$70,000 per year.  He left where he was employed as the warehouse manager to move \nto a new area which he and his wife believed was the best place for his family.  He had \na tentative job offer that was not guaranteed.  He placed his house for sale and \npurchased another house in the new location before his old house sold.  His former \nresidence did not sell and he could not afford to make payments on both houses.  The \nold house has been foreclosed (See Item 4, Credit Report, dated January 28, 2008 at \n2).  The tentative job offer did not materialize and he eventually found employment with \nthe defense contractor at half the salary that he had received as a warehouse manager.  \nIn response to interrogatories, Applicant stated that he and his wife now take home \nabout $3,900 per month with monthly expenses of $3,589, leaving discretionary or \ndisposable funds of approximately $311 per month (Item 8, Interrogatories, at 6).   \n \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997 and his debts of about $25,000 \nwere discharged in March 1998.  Applicant stated he lost track of his bills and he got \nover his head in debt.  He used credit cards for Christmas presents and every day \nexpenses.  He paid only the minimum on his credit cards and became financially \ndelinquent because of high interest rates on the credit cards.  This financial \nirresponsibility caused him and his wife to file for bankruptcy (SOR 1.a; Item 8, Interview \nstatement, dated November 28, 2006, at 2, and interview statement, dated June 19, \n2007 at 5-6).   \n \nThe SOR lists four delinquent debts that became delinquent after the bankruptcy \ndischarge totaling approximately $49,267.  Applicant admits these debts.  The debts \ninclude a line of credit loan from HFC for $32,529, charged off in December 2005 (SOR \n1.b); a loan from Washington Mutual for $13,137, charged off in May 2006 (SOR 1.c); a \nline of credit account with Equity One, charged off in August 2006 for $3,373 (SOR 1.d), \nand a debt of $228 placed for collection in August 2007 (SOR 1.e; See Item 4, Credit \nReport, dated January 28, 2008; Item 5, Credit Report, dated January 23, 2007; and \nItem 6, Credit Report, dated January 26, 2006).  Applicant admits he has taken no \naction to make any payments on these debts (Item 7, Answer to Interrogatories, dated \nMarch 19, 2008).   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn response to interrogatories, Applicant stated that after the bankruptcy \ndischarge he managed his finances without incurring delinquent debt until September \n2005 when he and his family moved, he could not sell is old house, and had a new \nhouse mortgage to pay.  When Applicant moved, the real estate market was good and \nApplicant believed he could sell his old house.  He purchased a new house in the area \nhe moved to at a price less than the asking price on his old house.  The housing market \ndownturned and he was not able to sell the former residence and it has been foreclosed \nfor the amount of the old mortgage.  He is current with the mortgage on the new house \nsince it is where he and his family are living.  Applicant notes that he incurred a $45,000 \nreduction in yearly salary affecting his ability to pay his delinquent debts.  He has been \nadvised by his lawyer to focus on keeping his present mortgage current since the old \ndebts can be discharged in bankruptcy later.  Appellant is making every effort to repay \nhis debts and to avoid a second bankruptcy.  However, he is starting over with his \nfinances due to the problem of selling his old residence and the reduction in his income.  \nHe stated his financial situation is slowly recovering (item 7, Interrogatories, dated \nMarch 19, 2008, at 1 and 2 \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s four delinquent debts are a security concern raising Financial \nConsideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) \"inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts\"; FC DC \u00b6 19(b) \"indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible \nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt\"; and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) \"a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\".  Applicant accumulated delinquent debts because he made no \neffort to pay his financial obligations.  The debt was accumulated after his previous \ndebts had been discharged by bankruptcy.  While the debts were on lines of credit and \nloans, the funds he received appear to be used for normal consumer items which \nindicate Applicant may be spending beyond his means.  He incurred a mortgage on a \nnew home before his old home was sold indicating irresponsible spending.  When his \nfinancial resources changed because of a move to a new location, it does not appear \nthat Applicant changed his spending priorities or life style. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) \"the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\".  Applicant took no action to pay \nthe four delinquent debts so the debts are current.  The debts are from various sources, \nlines of credit, loans, and credit cards, so they are not infrequent.  The debts may have \nbeen incurred because Applicant voluntarily moved from one area to another, had a \nlower paying job, and could not sell his former residence, but these are not unusual \ncircumstances since Applicant acted voluntarily.  Since the debts are current and not \npaid, they cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\".  Applicant claims he was \nunemployed for a month after he moved, and took a pay cut when he had new \nemployment.  He presented no information on how or why these events impacted his \nability to make some payments on his debts.  In fact, Applicant and his wife have been \nand are gainfully employed and they have a monthly positive cash flow.  There has \nbeen no attempt to pay past due obligations indicating that he is not trying to resolve his \nindebtedness.  He did not establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \nApplicant made a voluntary decision to move his family.  This was not a condition \nbeyond his control.  He then purchased a new house before he sold his old one creating \na severe financial hardship.  His actions were within his control.  He has not acted \nresponsibly in managing his finances. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\".  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant presented no information to show he has a plan to pay the debts or any action \nthat he has taken to pay his debts.  Applicant has sufficient income to make some \npayments on his delinquent debts but has not attempted to do so.  His and his wife have \na combined income of about $48,000 a year, with a net remainder each month of over \n$311 that could be used for debt reduction.  Applicant's debts were discharged in \nbankruptcy in 1998 and he started accumulating delinquent debts again in 2005.  \nBankruptcy is a legal and permissible means of resolving indebtedness.  However, the \ncircumstances of the bankruptcy action can be examined to determine any security \nsignificance.  The filing of the bankruptcy action in itself does not create a security \nconcern.  Applicant admitted he incurred financial problems because he was \nirresponsible towards his finances necessitating the bankruptcy filing.  Applicant \naccumulated delinquent debt after the bankruptcy discharge indicating a continual \nirresponsible and indifferent attitude towards his finances.  There is no indication \nApplicant acted responsibly towards his debts or that the situation is under control.  In \nfact, the opposite seems to be true, his finances are not under control and he has not \n\n \n6 \n \n \nacted responsibly.  Applicant has not presented sufficient information to indicate a good \nfaith effort to pay creditors or resolve debts.  He has not presented sufficient information \nto mitigate security concerns for financial considerations. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant has not taken action to resolve his past due debts.  His indifferent \nattitude and lack of actions shows he is not trustworthy, responsible, or exercises good \njudgment.  Applicant has been irresponsible towards his delinquent debts and financial \nobligations.  This is an indication that he might be irresponsible towards the protection \nand handling of classified information.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from his finances.  Clearance is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Applicant is 55 and married. He is a co-founder and officer of a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline D - Sexual Behavior Guideline E - Personal Conduct The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has had an extra-marital affair since 2004 with a woman (\u201cA\u201d), that he loaned or gave A $16,000.00, and that neither of their spouses know of the affair. The Applicant admits 1 the factual allegations in the SOR, but denies that his conduct has security significance. The Applicant is currently married to his fourth wife. They have been married since 1992. The Applicant and his current wife had an extra-marital affair while he was married to his third wife. According to the Applicant, he has known A since 1996. They began dating in 2004 and they have had a sexual relationship since that time. A was born in a foreign country, but is a naturalized American citizen. During their relationship, the Applicant and A have taken at least five vacations overseas. (Government Exhibit 2 at 5-7.) During one of these vacations, which was in conjunction with a business trip to A\u2019s home country, one of the Applicant\u2019s employees became aware of the affair between the Applicant and A. This occurred in February 2007. (Transcript at 38-39; Government Exhibit 2 at 6-7.) The Applicant gave $16,000.00 to A in the year 2005. According to the Applicant, this was a gift to A to allow h",

On July 30, 2008, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guidelines D and E concerning the Applicant.  The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on August 19, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to another\n\nThe SOR originally had the monetary figure at $15,000.00.  This figure was amended to $16,000.00 to\n1\ncomport with the evidence presented.  (Transcript at 113.)\n2\nAdministrative Judge on September 12, 2008.  I received the case assignment on\nNovember 13, 2008.  DOHA had previously issued a notice of hearing on October 15,\n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 14, 2008. The\nGovernment offered Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called two additional witnesses, and\nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript\nof the hearing on November 25, 2008.  The record closed on November 25, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 55 and married.  He is a co-founder and officer of a defense\ncontractor and seeks to retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline D - Sexual Behavior\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he\nhas had an extra-marital affair since 2004 with a woman (\u201cA\u201d), that he loaned or gave A\n$16,000.00, and that neither of their spouses know of the affair.   The Applicant admits\n1\nthe factual allegations in the SOR, but denies that his conduct has security significance.\nThe Applicant is currently married to his fourth wife.  They have been married\nsince 1992.  The Applicant and his current wife had an extra-marital affair while he was\nmarried to his third wife.\nAccording to the Applicant, he has known A since 1996.  They began dating in\n2004 and they have had a sexual relationship since that time.  A was born in a foreign\ncountry, but is a naturalized American citizen.  During their relationship, the Applicant\nand A have taken at least five vacations overseas.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 5-7.)\nDuring one of these vacations, which was in conjunction with a business trip to A\u2019s\nhome country, one of the Applicant\u2019s employees became aware of the affair between\nthe Applicant and A.  This occurred in February 2007.  (Transcript at 38-39;\nGovernment Exhibit 2 at 6-7.) \n  The Applicant gave $16,000.00 to A in the year 2005.  According to the\nApplicant, this was a gift to A to allow her to purchase a home.  Also according to the\nApplicant, A views the money as a loan.  The Applicant was asked about this\ntransaction during his interview with an authorized investigator of the Defense\nDepartment.  It was as a result of that discussion that the Applicant admitted his affair\nwith A.  Once again, neither spouse is aware of this transaction.  (Transcript at 46-47;\nGovernment Exhibit 2 at 4-5.)\n\n3\nThe Applicant continued the relationship with A during the pendency of the\nhearing.  He testified that he saw A the day before the hearing (Transcript at 40), and\nthat they had sex within a week of the hearing (Transcript at 43).  The Applicant was\nasked why he continued to engage in this relationship knowing of the Federal\nGovernment\u2019s interest.  (Transcript at 42-43.)  The Applicant stated, \u201cBecause I feel it is\nunrelated to me being under any type of coercion to give up classified information.\nThese are totally unrelated incidents or circumstances.\u201d  (Transcript at 43.)\nThe Applicant has stated that he was not proud of his affair with A and that it was\na mistake.  (Transcript at 39; Government Exhibit 2 at 4.)  However, he later testified:\nThere is a, you know, I believe, again, that it is a - - publicly, people\nmight think it\u2019s immoral to have an extra-marital affair, but people do get\nattached to other people, and it does go further than just friendship, and\nthat is what happened here.  I don\u2019t intend it to - - I mean it\u2019s just\nsomething that I am now involved with.  Although I might have mentioned\nit is a mistake, it is just that I am now into that relationship, and she has\nbeen a friend of mine for some time.  And it is something that I just feel it\nis private, and I want to keep it to myself.  (Transcript at 40-41.)  \nThe Applicant\u2019s wife is not aware of his relationship with A (Transcript at 31), and\nA\u2019s spouse is not aware of her relationship with him (Government Exhibit 2 at 4).  In\naddition, the Applicant\u2019s wife is not aware of the $16,000.00 loan or gift to A, or the fact\nthat A has accompanied the Applicant on at least five trips overseas.  (Transcript at 34.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s business partner is not aware of his relationship with A.  The\nbusiness partner is aware that the Applicant\u2019s security clearance is at risk.  (Transcript\nat 32, 41-42.)  \nThe Applicant stated several times that he does not believe himself to be\nvulnerable to exploitation or pressure because of his relationship with A.  (See e.g.\nTranscript at 30-31, 36.)  He testified that he would inform his wife of the relationship if\nhe was threatened with exposure.  (Transcript at 38.)  The Applicant has also indicated\nthat, if his wife found out about the affair, he would terminate the relationship with A.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 4.)  He further stated that he has no fear of divorce because\nhe has been through that before.  (Transcript at 48-49.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant called a clinical psychologist to testify.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  The\npsychologist testified about the Applicant\u2019s psychological profile. In particular, the\nwitness related his opinion concerning the Applicant\u2019s ability to withstand coercion.\n(Transcript at 58-61.)  He also stated that the Applicant did not appear to have a\npersonality disorder that might make the Applicant a security risk.  (Transcript at 61-62.)\n\n4\nA retired FBI agent also testified for the Applicant and submitted a statement.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  This witness has done background investigations for agencies\nof the Federal Government.  He was, however, unfamiliar with the Directive and the\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  (Transcript at 94.)  During his testimony, the witness stated\nthat his opinion was the Applicant was not subject to coercion, and that his conduct did\nnot show a lack of discretion or judgment.  (Transcript at 102-103.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\n\n5\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG\n\u00b6 12:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion,\nor which may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion,\nexploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  No adverse\ninference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely\non the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Based\non the evidence presented, the following conditions have applicability in this case: AG \u00b6\n13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation or duress,\u201d and \u00b6 13(d), \u201csexual behavior of a public nature and/or that\nreflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns given the facts\nof this case. Under AG & 16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about\none\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\n\n6\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional or community standing. . .\u201d\nThe Applicant has been involved in a long-term affair with A.  He has actively\nkept his wife, business partner and others from finding out about the affair, or his giving\nA $16,000.00.  The Applicant may deny it, but the evidence convincingly shows that he\nfeels he has something to hide concerning this relationship.  Whether it is because he\nthinks the relationship is wrong, a mistake or nobody else\u2019s business is of no moment.\nIt is axiomatic that having something to hide makes you vulnerable to exploitation,\ncoercion or duress.  He has done nothing to reduce or eliminate that vulnerability.  \nThe Applicant claims that his relationship with A is private, consensual and\ndiscreet, and therefore not of interest to the Government.  He is wrong.  First, he has\nbeen so indiscreet as to take his lover on a business trip and have dinner with one of his\nemployees along with her.  Not only that, but they took this combined business and\npersonal trip to her home country.  This particular conduct shows not only a lack of\ndiscretion, but a lack of judgment.  This lack of judgment on the Applicant\u2019s part, when it\ncomes to A, is also shown by his continuing to have a sexual relationship with her\nduring the pendency of this hearing and knowing the fact of that sexual relationship is of\nconcern to the Government.\n  The Applicant was truthful with the Government once the right question was\nasked about his relationship with A.  He then attempts to argue that the truthfulness\nshows he is not subject to coercion.  That is a false attempt to make a virtue out of a\nnecessity.  Applicants for security clearance are required to provide truthful answers.\nThe mere fact that he has been truthful with us does not show that he is, therefore, not\nsubject to coercion.  Once again, it is particularly troubling that his business partner\ndoes not know the basis for this action against the Applicant.\nNone of the Mitigating Conditions under Guidelines D or E have application in\nthis case.  Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR are found against the Applicant.\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n\n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a successful\nbusinessman.  However, he is involved in a relationship which, under the particular\ncircumstances of this case, makes him particularly vulnerable to coercion, and shows\npoor judgment and a lack of discretion.\nIn viewing all the facts of this case, I find that the Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity significance of his relationship with A.  As set forth at length above, the conduct\nwas recent (AG \u00b62(a)(3)), voluntary (AG \u00b62(a)(5)), and there have been no pertinent\nbehavioral changes (AG \u00b62(a)(6)). I find that there is considerable potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that the likelihood of\nrecurrence is close to 100% (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his sexual\nbehavior and personal conduct.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant was divorced in July 2002 and \nwas unable to keep current on the loan for a few months and eventually had difficulty \npaying all of his bills. The vehicle was repossessed in January 2003. At the time it was \nrepossessed he believed the balance on the loan was $8,000 to $9,000. Applicant did \nnot receive any correspondence on this account since the repossession. He does not \nhave any agreement to pay this debt.  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is for a car loan. Applicant signed a loan for a car for his \ndaughter because she was unable to get a loan. His daughter was to make the monthly \npayments. The account was opened in January 2003. Applicant believed the original \n \n1 Item 4. \n \n2 Item 5. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \namount of the loan was $23,000. His daughter made a few payments and then \ndefaulted on the loan. Applicant tried to return the car to the creditor, but his daughter \nhad given the car to her ex-husband and Applicant could not locate it. Applicant could \nnot make the payments on the car and received repossession notices from the creditor. \nSometime in 2003 the car was impounded and the driver of the car was arrested for an \noutstanding warrant. Approximately 13 months after the car was impounded Applicant \nreceived a notice from a collection company requesting payment of $18,000 for the car. \nHe later received a settlement offer for $9,000. He notified the collection company he \ncould not pay the amount. Applicant has not made any attempt to repay the loan. \n \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on October 26, 2007. He stated he intended to pay all of his \ndelinquent debts and would file for bankruptcy if he was unable to make the payments. \nHe stated he started a new job and a new life in a different state. He stated all of his \nmonthly bills were current.3  \n \n \nApplicant provided a statement explaining his debts became delinquent due to \nhis divorce and they were incurred when he was living in a two income household. In his \nstatement Applicant refers to another long-term debt he is currently paying. He stated \nhe would like to pay his delinquent debts but does not earn enough money. No other \ninformation was provided.4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n \n3 Id. \n \n4 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts totaling $37,720 that he incurred years ago and \nremain unpaid. He has not taken any action to resolve the debts. Applicant does not \nhave sufficient resources to pay the debts. I find both disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant admits he owes all of the delinquent debts and they remain unpaid. \nTherefore, the debts are recent and based on Applicant\u2019s financial situation I can not \nfind the problem is unlikely to recur. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. \nApplicant bought his daughter a car and she was required to make the payments on it. \nShe failed to do so and because the car loan was in Applicant\u2019s name he was \nresponsible to pay the loan. He did not pay the loan. Applicant took out a loan to buy a \ncar and took out a signature loan, both with his wife. They divorced and he could not \npay these loans. These are conditions that were somewhat beyond his control. In order \nfor mitigating condition (b) to be fully applicable Applicant must have acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Applicant did not provide evidence to show he has taken any \naction to resolve these debts or made any payments towards them since he defaulted \non them. I find mitigating condition (b) only partially applies. There is no evidence \nApplicant has received financial counseling or the problem is under control. There is \nalso no evidence Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay his delinquent debts. I \nfind none of the remaining mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has three large delinquent \ndebts that have remained unpaid for many years. Although he stated he intends to pay \nhis delinquent debts he has not taken any action to do so. Applicant failed to provide \nsufficient evidence to meet his burden of persuasion. I am unable to conclude Applicant \nhas successfully mitigated the security concerns raised. Overall the record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on June 28, 2006. On September 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its decision to deny her\na security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 29, 2008. She\nsubmitted an undated written answer to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case\nwas assigned to me on November 17, 2008, to conduct a hearing and to determine\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. On November 21, 2008, Applicant requested that her hearing\nApril 8, 2009\n\n2\nbe held in mid to late January 2009, to give her more time to prepare. On December 16,\n2008, I scheduled a hearing for January 9, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Five government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) and\nseven Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-G) were admitted. Applicant and one witness, a family\nfriend who holds a high position with Applicant\u2019s employer, testified on her behalf, as\nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on January 28, 2009. Based on a review of the\nSOR, Answer, transcript, and documentary exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\ndelinquent debt totaling $55,872 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.q). Applicant denied the debts\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.o, totaling about $2,118. She admitted the\nother debts. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of\nfact.\nApplicant is a 31-year-old environmental safety and occupational health\nengineer, who has been employed by a defense contractor since May 2006 (Ex. 1, Tr.\n100). Applicant seeks a secret-level security clearance for her duties, never having\npreviously held a security clearance.\nIn the fall of 1995, Applicant began her undergraduate studies (Tr. 64-65). She\nfinanced her education through student loans totaling about $22,153 with one lender\nand $1,000 with another (Exs. 4, 5), work-study at the college during her sophomore\nyear, and employment as a writing consultant at a learning center from September 1997\nto February 2000 (Ex. 1). In February 1998, Applicant took out an $8,083 automobile\nloan on which she made regular payments (Ex. 5). Applicant was awarded her B.A.\ndegree in biology and environmental studies in February 2000 (Ex. 1, Tr. 65). That\nSeptember, she began pursuing graduate studies in neuropsychology part-time while\nworking in a low-paying student co-op position, initially as a wildlife biologist for the U.S.\ngovernment from March 2000 to August 2001, and then at the same duty location as a\nsurveyor under the employ of a university (Ex. 1, Tr. 65-66).\nApplicant was unemployed from October 2001 to August 2002, when she\nreturned to her previous part-time position as a surveyor. In November 2002, she left\nthat position for a graduate research position at the university where she was pursuing\nher studies. After the spring semester of 2003, she discontinued her academic studies\nso that she could focus on her employment search (Tr. 73). She realized that her\nfinances were getting out of control and she needed more income (Tr. 84). She kept her\nresearch assistant position until November 2004 (Ex. 1), but had to rely heavily on credit\ncards to pay her expenses (Tr. 73). Several of her financial obligations became\nseriously delinquent during the 2002 to 2004 time frame. Also, the university sought\n$1,134 in unpaid class fees (SOR \u00b6 1.l) for a course that she never took (Exs. 3, 4, 5,\nTr. 80-83).\n\n3\nApplicant worked full-time as a project biologist for a commercial company\nstarting in December 2004 at an annual salary of $32,000 (Tr. 85). Her financial\nsituation improved in that she did not continue to take on new debt until October 24,\n2005, when she suffered a substantial loss of personal property in Hurricane Wilma.\nShe lacked rental insurance and incurred an estimated $15,000 in out-of-pocket costs to\nreplace her clothing, home furnishings (dishes, furniture, etc.), and computer (Tr. 54-\n57). About $2,000 was spent to repair and clean her water-damaged automobile (Tr.\n57). Applicant borrowed about $10,000 from family members that she repaid by late\n2007 at priority over her delinquent consumer credit accounts (Tr. 57-58).\nIn January 2006, she was laid off by her employer (Ex. 1, Tr. 57). She incurred a\ncouple of medical debts at that time (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c) that she thought were covered by\ninsurance (Tr. 66-67). In March 2006, she started working as an environmental scientist\nfor another company, but she left that job for her current employment in May 2006 (Ex.\n1) at a salary of $55,000 annually (Tr. 101). On June 28, 2006, Applicant completed an\ne-QIP for a secret-level security clearance. In response to questions 28.a (any debts\nover 180 days delinquent in the last seven years) and 28.b (any debts currently\ndelinquent over 90 days), Applicant listed eight debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j,\n1.q, and 1.m) totaling $30,611. She indicated payment status was to be determined with\nrespect to each of the debts (Ex. 1).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on July 11, 2006, revealed she had repaid the\n$1,000 student loan satisfactorily. Her other student loan account was in good standing\nwith a $22,030 balance, but several of her delinquent consumer credit accounts had\nbeen placed for collection, as set forth in the following table (Ex. 5).\nDebt as alleged in SOR\nDelinquency history\nPayment status as of Jan\n09\n\u00b6 1.a. $11,663 credit card\ndebt in collection\nCredit card last activity\nNov 03, $8,130 balance\nfor collection Jul 05 (Ex.\n1), $8,431 balance as of\nOct 05 (Exs. 3, 4, 5),\n$11,663 balance as of Oct\n07 (Ex. 4), $12,938\nbalance in collection as of\nJul 08 (Ex. 3).\nContacted creditor after\nAug 1, 08 (Ex. 2, Tr. 61-\n62), inquired about settling\nfor lesser amount, creditor\nunwilling to waive interest\n(Tr. 62).

No\npayments (Tr. 92).\nIn about February 2007, Applicant received an 8 percent increase in pay when\nshe went from her job in the quality department to her present position of environmental\nsafety and occupational health engineer (Tr. 100-01). In August 2007, she was\ninterviewed by a government investigator about her delinquent debt. She expressed a\nwillingness to resolve the debt. In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant\nindicated on August 1, 2008, that she had contacted those creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i,\nand 1.p to discuss repayment terms. She requested proof of the telephone debt in SOR\n\u00b6 1.k, and disputed those debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.l. Applicant denied knowledge of\nthe medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, but indicated she would find out how to\nresolve them. At DOHA\u2019s request, she completed a personal financial statement in\nwhich she estimated a net monthly remainder of $39 after paying $100 each month on\nher student loan principal balance of $21,617.13 (Ex. 3, Ex. D). Applicant added that\nshe had paid off her private debt to family and friends, was not accruing new debt, and\nhad only one active credit card account on which she was paying more than the monthly\nminimum. She expressed an intent to make payments on her debts when she was\nfinancially able to do so (Ex. 2).\nIn February 2008, Applicant attended a presentation at her local library about\ndebt management (Tr. 97). She also telephoned at least one consumer credit\ncounseling service, apparently sometime in 2008 (Tr. 97). In about July 2008, Applicant\nattended a seminar at work concerning employee benefits, including a program\nproviding legal coverage in debt collection actions (Ex. F, Tr. 43, 96). In October 2008,\nduring the enrollment period, she signed up for the coverage at a cost to her of $10 per\nmonth, with her eligibility to run for one year starting January 2009 (Tr. 44, 98).\nApplicant intends to have an attorney within the plan negotiate with her creditors to get\nthe interest charges waived on her debts and to arrange for settlements on her behalf\n(Tr. 44, 95).\nDespite an annual salary of $60,000 for her work with the defense contractor (Tr.\n86), Applicant\u2019s budget is \u201cusually pretty tight.\u201d (Tr. 89). Applicant\u2019s rent is now $900 a\nmonth. It had been $1,200 until November 2008 when she moved to be closer to work\nand to reduce costs (Tr. 90, 99). Her utility costs are about $230 plus a disposal fee.\nCable television, Internet, and telephone (home and cell) total about $250 per month\n(Tr. 87). She paid off her car a couple of years ago, so she does not have a car\npayment, although she pays about $130 every three months in car insurance (Tr. 89).\nShe needs to budget for a car payment as her automobile \u201cis on its way out.\u201d (Tr. 88).\nApplicant pays $100 per month on her student loan, which had a principal balance of\n$21,774.04 as of December 12, 2008, and it was in good standing (Ex. D). She spends\nabout $150 per month on medications (Tr. 89).\nAs of December 2008, Applicant was reported by Equifax Information Services\nto owe a balance of $1,259 on her active credit card account which had a limit of $1,200\n(Ex. 3). Applicant made payments within the last two months to bring her balance to\n\n7\nabout $800 (Tr. 93). Applicant admits that she exceeded her credit limit because of\nrecent travel and holiday gifts (Tr. 93).\nA high-ranking employee for the defense contractor testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf\nat her hearing. An old family friend, he provided her some assistance in the application\nprocess but did not participate in the decision to hire her. They have worked on a couple\nof projects together, including some company sensitive internal efforts to remove\nhazardous chemicals from the production process. Applicant has given him no reason\nto doubt her personal integrity, judgment, or reliability (Tr. 116-23). He understood that\nApplicant had some financial problems after the hurricane, but he remains unaware of\nthe extent (Tr. 124).\nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor since January 2007 has had the opportunity to\nclosely observe Applicant\u2019s work performance and handling of company sensitive\ninformation. He considers her to be a valuable member of their section. In the past year,\nshe was responsible for coordinating and arranging several program events using\ncompany funding and she executed her duties \u201cflawlessly.\u201d (Ex. A).\nA professional colleague, who has spent time in Applicant\u2019s apartment, attests\nthat Applicant appears to be living within her means. In their work interactions, Applicant\nhas exhibited willingness to abide by rules and regulations required by the government,\ntheir employer, and subcontractors (Ex. B). The company\u2019s security manager is also\naware of no reason to question Applicant\u2019s integrity or her ability to safeguard classified\ninformation (Ex. C).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\n\n8\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant disputes the validity of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.k, 1.l, and\n1.o. All of these debts appear on one or more of her credit reports. At the same time,\nApplicant can successfully rebut the credit listing by credible evidence that she has \u201ca\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt that is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d (see AG \u00b6 20(e)). Applicant relies\nsolely on her testimony, which is accepted given her overall candor about her debts.\nApplicant asserted that the $595 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) should have been paid by a\nformer insurer (Tr. 68). The medical debt was incurred in January 2006, and she was\nlaid off that same month. Her explanation of insurance error is plausible. She credibly\nexplained that she had made several co-pay payments of $35 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and one was\nsimply not credited to her account. Concerning the $713 debt claimed by a previous\nlandlord (SOR \u00b6 1.d), Applicant surmises the debt is likely from charges after she\nvacated but the apartments have since been leveled (\u201cThe reason why I had to move\nout is because they were demolishing the house, so I don\u2019t know what charges they\ncould have charged on a house that they demolished and then built stuff on.\u201d Tr. 71).\n\n9\nThe legitimacy of the debt does not turn on whether she can successfully contact her\nformer landlord or the collection agency, but it is unclear what the debt was for or\nwhether the creditor would pursue the debt. There has been no effort by the creditor to\nreport a past due balance to Equifax since January 2005 (see Exs. 3, 4). The $149 debt\n(SOR \u00b6 1.k) owed for telephone charges from June 2002 is still listed as an open\ncollection debt. However, Applicant has requested proof of the debt, which she has\nconsistently denied. As for the $1,134 debt balance (SOR \u00b6 1.l) from March 2003,\nApplicant testified that the university assumed incorrectly from a $100 credit on her\naccount that she had registered for a class that she had not taken; that the university\nunderstood the error and it would not bar her from obtaining her transcript. Applicant\ndoes not recognize the $87 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.o) and it does not appear on her recent\ncredit reports.\nApplicant does not dispute that she incurred delinquent balances on several\ncredit card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.m, 1.p, and 1.q), a $220\nmedical debt in 2003, or a deficiency balance on an automobile loan for a vehicle that\nwas repossessed when she could no longer afford to make the payments. Although\nunaware of the nature of the $175 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n, she does not dispute its validity.\nShe has satisfied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h, and paid about $1,200 through wage\nattachment toward the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i. Yet, even after these payments, her total\nundisputed delinquent debt balance exceeds $50,000. If the creditor of the debt in SOR\n\u00b6 1.p demands the full $18,214, her outstanding delinquent debt totals more than\n$60,000. Significant security concerns are raised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nTo the extent that over extension on consumer credit cards reflects spending beyond\nher means, AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis\u201d), this behavior was confined to when she\nwas in college and graduate school and lacking full-time, well-paying employment.\nConcerning potential mitigation of the undisputed delinquent debt, most of the\naccounts became delinquent in 2002 and 2003, when she was in graduate school and\nheld part-time employment. Yet, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d\ncannot be fully applied in mitigation. She remains under a significant debt burden that\nshe has only recently begun to resolve.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is implicated. She ran up about $35,793 on\neight credit card accounts before they were charged off and/or referred for collection\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.p, and 1.q).  Without income or expense information\navailable for 2002/03, it is unclear to what extent Applicant relied on consumer credit for\nschooling versus living or discretionary expenditures while she was in graduate school.\nHowever, lack of income was a factor in incurring the debt. Furthermore, personal\n\n10\nproperty losses incurred during the October 2005 hurricane forced her to borrow about\n$10,000 that was repaid at priority over her old debts. Yet, the financial setback caused\nby the hurricane cannot reasonably be relied on to explain the delay in addressing her\ndelinquent indebtedness over the latter half of 2007 into 2008. She began working for\nher current employer in May 2006 at an annual salary of $55,000. In February 2007, her\nincome increased to $60,000. She satisfied her personal loans to family members by\nlate 2007, but had made no payments on any of her undisputed delinquencies as of her\nresponse to DOHA interrogatories in August 2008.\nIt is only within the past year that she has taken meaningful steps to resolve her\ndebts. In about February 2008, Applicant attended a presentation at her local library on\ndebt management. In July 2008, she learned of a potential employment benefit in that\nshe could retain an attorney to negotiate on her behalf with her creditors. During the\nopen enrollment period in October 2008, she enrolled for this calendar year. Albeit in\nresponse to a garnishment action by the assignee, she began making payments of\n$200 per paycheck starting October 10, 2008, on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i. In November\n2008, she satisfied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies in part, but it\nwould be premature to apply AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control.\u201d\nWith her student loan debt at about $21,774 and delinquent debt now amounting\nto as much as $61,729 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e-1.j, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.q), Applicant is not likely to\nresolve her debts in the foreseeable future. As of her hearing, it was unclear whether\nany of her creditors would waive the interest charges on her past due debts. Even after\nmoving closer to work in November 2008 to reduce her expenses, her budget was still\n\u201cpretty tight.\u201d Her credit report of January 2009 (Ex. 3) shows she was $59 over her\ncredit limit of $1,200 on her only active credit card account as of December 2008,\nalthough Applicant testified that she made several payments in excess of the monthly\nminimum to where her account is now below its limit.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n11\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person\nanalysis in financial cases stating:\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is\nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge\ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation\nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for\nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts\nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in\nthe SOR.\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nApplicant has taken a credible first step toward resolving her debt by enrolling in a legal\ncare benefit program at work. However, it remains to be seen whether she or her\nattorney will be able to negotiate debt repayment terms that she can reasonably afford.\nPayments made in fall 2008 to satisfy the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h are not enough to establish\n\u201ca meaningful track record\u201d in light of her serious delinquency on several accounts over\nthe past five to six years. Applicant has proven that she can handle company sensitive\ninformation appropriately, but it does not completely dispel the judgment concerns\nraised by her irresponsibility in her personal financial affairs. Based on the record before\nme, I cannot conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance at this time.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 38-year-old developer for a defense contractor, working on software and web sites. Divorced in 1999, Applicant is currently in a stable relationship with a teacher\u2019s assistant. He is a home owner with excellent credit. Starting in 1987, at about the age of 17 during his junior year, Applicant began the recreational use of marijuana, an illegal drug. He knew the substance was illegal.1 He did not use the drug in public or at large gatherings, limiting his use to sporadic events with an inner circle of friends. The frequency of his use varied from daily, to just weekends, to only once or twice a month. \u201cThere were times where [he] just stopped for six months just because [he] didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d As a teen, he used the drug for \u201cfun.\u201d 2 3 Following high school he worked and completed an associate\u2019s degree in applied science and electronics. After visiting what is now his current area of residence, Applicant and his now ex-wife moved to that area in 1996. He worked in several technological and network areas and held various second jobs for several years and built a favorable reputation. Throughout this time, he continued to use marijuana to help him relax. By 2005, Applicant\u2019s drug abuse had decreased somewhat. In December 4 2005, he thought he would stop using marijuana. He used it at least two more time, however, after that time. He finally quit in April 2007. He did so for a number of reasons: His girlfriend would not tolerate its use. He is ",

On June 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nIn a response received on July 7, 2008, Applicant admitted the sole allegation\nraised under Guideline H. Applicant also requested a hearing before a DOHA\nAdministrative Judge. I was assigned the case on August 18, 2008. Department\nCounsel and Applicant proposed a September 16, 2008, hearing, and a Notice of\nHearing was issued to that effect on August 27, 2008.\nNovember 24, 2008\n\n Tr. 39. \n1\n Tr. 25.\n2\n Tr. 26.\n3\n Id.\n4\n Applicant last saw one of his old friends in April 2007. Applicant did not use marijuana on that occasion, but\n5\nit was the last month he used the drug. Tr. 33. \n2\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted three\nexhibits (Exs.) which were accepted into the record as Exs. 1-3 without objection.\nApplicant submitted five exhibits, accepted as Exs. A-E without objection. Applicant\u2019s\nboss appeared as a witness and gave testimony. Applicant was given until September\n26, 2008, to submit any further materials. On September 23, 2008, Applicant submitted\nby facsimile transmission one additional document, a statement of intent, which was\naccepted into the record as Ex. F without objection; the original document followed by\nregular mail. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 26, 2008. The record was\nthen closed. Based upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security\nclearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old developer for a defense contractor, working on\nsoftware and web sites. Divorced in 1999, Applicant is currently in a stable relationship\nwith a teacher\u2019s assistant. He is a home owner with excellent credit. \nStarting in 1987, at about the age of 17 during his junior year, Applicant began\nthe recreational use of marijuana, an illegal drug. He knew the substance was illegal.1\nHe did not use the drug in public or at large gatherings, limiting his use to sporadic\nevents with an inner circle of friends. The frequency of his use varied from daily, to just\nweekends, to only once or twice a month. \u201cThere were times where [he] just stopped for\nsix months just because [he] didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d  As a teen, he used the drug for \u201cfun.\u201d\n2\n3\nFollowing high school he worked and completed an associate\u2019s degree in applied\nscience and electronics. After visiting what is now his current area of residence,\nApplicant and his now ex-wife moved to that area in 1996. He worked in several\ntechnological and network areas and held various second jobs for several years and\nbuilt a favorable reputation. Throughout this time, he continued to use marijuana to help\nhim relax.  By 2005, Applicant\u2019s drug abuse had decreased somewhat. In December\n4\n2005, he thought he would stop using marijuana. He used it at least two more time,\nhowever, after that time. He finally quit in April 2007. He did so for a number of reasons:\nHis girlfriend would not tolerate its use. He is serving as sort of stepfather to his\ngirlfriend\u2019s pre-teen children. He did not want to set a bad example for a nephew and\nniece who then lived nearby. The smoke irritated his eyes. He had a new inner circle of\nfriends and he had been seeing less and less of the friends with whom he would use\nmarijuana.  Such considerations led him to quit cold turkey, without any assistance.\n5\n\n Ex. 1 (e-QIP) at 28 of 31.\n6\n Ex. 2 (Interrogatories). \n7\n Tr. 30, 44.\n8\n Tr. 35.\n9\n Ex.F (Statement of Intent, dated Sep. 23, 2008).\n10\n Tr. 49.\n11\n Tr. 53.\n12\n3\nIn executing his e-QIP on on February 5, 2008, Applicant admitted in response to\nQuestion 24 that he had illegally used a controlled substance (marijuana) since the age\nof 16 or in the last 7 years. He noted that he used marijuana \u201c100+\u201d times between\nOctober 2000 (estimated) and April 2007 (estimated). He wrote in the space provided\nfor additional comments: \u201cI experimented on and off through out the years. I quit\nDecember 2005. I thought maybe just on special occasions. It only took a few\noccasions and decided that I didn\u2019t want anything to do with marijuana and I don\u2019t plan\non ever trying it again.\u201d  He provided substantially the same answers the following\n6\nmonth during an interview.  The two incidents of drug use between December 2005 and\n7\nApril 2007 were not special occasions. He was at home alone on the first occasion; the\nsecond time he used the drug was with a friend.\nTo date, Applicant has been drug-free for about a year and a half. He has no\nintention of illegally using marijuana again.  He has successfully passed three drug\n8\nscreening tests since June 2007, when he started work for his current employer.9\nApplicant has signed a notarized statement that any future violation of Guideline H shall\nconstitute automatic revocation of any security clearance granted to him.  \n10\nApplicant has the support of many individuals, as reflected in the many\nrecommendations introduced at the hearing. His boss describes him as an excellent\nemployee who is reliable and trustworthy.  He has witnessed Applicant mature over the\n11\ntime they have worked together and noted that Applicant has never seemed happier.12\nApplicant\u2019s boss believes Applicant to be sincere with regard to his expressed intent not\nto use marijuana again in the future.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n13\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n14\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n15\n Id.\n16\n Id.\n17\n4\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n13\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n14\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n15\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n16\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n17\n\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n18\n Because Applicant readily admits he bought the marijuana he used, specific discussion as to the unique\n19\nfacts involved in how he solicited such purchases is reserved for Guideline E, Personal Conduct.\n5\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n18\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline H - Drug\nInvolvement. to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case. The\nconcern under that guideline is that use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as\nmood and behavior altering substances, and include drugs, materials, and other\nchemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as\namended, (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and\nhallucinogens) and inhalants and other substances. \u201cDrug abuse\u201d is the illegal use of a\ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction. \nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nAnalysis\nApplicant admits he used marijuana with varying frequency from the time he was\na teenager in 1987 to until last year, 2007. Consequently, Drug Involvement (DI)\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse) applies.  With a disqualifying\n19\ncondition thus established, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate security concerns.\nApplicant began using marijuana during his junior year of high school. He\ncontinued using the drug, knowing it was illegal, into maturity. His use varied from daily\nto weekends only. Sometimes he would go for periods as long as six months without\nusing the drug, but he would eventually relapse and continue its illegal use. Indeed,\nafter he \u201cquit\u201d in 2005, he still relapsed and abused the drug at least twice before\nquitting again in April 2007. Under such facts, DI Mitigating Condition (MC) 1, AG \u00b6\n26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nMarijuana was Applicant\u2019s drug of choice. Consequently, DI MC 3, AG \u00b6 26(c)\n(abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during which these\ndrugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended) does not apply. Similarly, because\nApplicant did not undergo a prescribed drug treatment program, DI MC 4, AG \u00b6 26(d)\n\n6\n(satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not\nlimited to rehabilitation and ftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a\nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional) does not apply.\nApplicant has expressed his intent not to use marijuana again in the future, both\norally and in writing. He rarely sees his old cohorts and now moves in a circle of peers\nwho do not use drugs. His girlfriend is adamantly opposed to its use. He has signed a\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any future violation. He\nhas refrained from marijuana use fo a year and a half. Such facts may raise sections\n(1), (2), and (4) of DI MC 2, AG \u00b6 26(b) (a documented intent not to abuse any drugs in\nthe future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)\nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate\nperiod of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation).\nThe facts, however, do not raise section (3) \u2013 an appropriate period of\nabstinence. Applicant is 38-years-old. He has abused marijuana for 20 of those years,\nhis entire adult life. He admits he went through periods of as long as six months without\nusing marijuana simply because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d Then relapsed to using the\ndrug as usual. His attempt to \u201cquit\u201d in 2005, unless a special occasion happened,\nresulted in him resorting to marijuana at least twice under less than stellar\ncircumstances. Had he satisfactorily completed a drug treatment program in which he\ncould have demonstrated a more concerted, guided effort to become drug-free,\nApplicant might have better demonstrated his resolve and ability to remain drug free. As\nit is, however, given the duration of his illegal drug use and his past relapses, a year\nand a half of being drug free is insufficient to establish a commitment to abstinence.\nConsequently, illegal drug related security concerns remain. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Applicant is an engaging, credible, and mature man who began\n\n Id.\n20\n7\nusing marijuana as a teen. He continued this illegal abuse for two decades. While he\nvoluntarily decided to quit drugs in 2007 for a number of persuasive and laudable\nreasons, he did so \u201ccold turkey,\u201d without professional or peer guidance. Although he is\nhighly credible in expressing his intention and desire not to abuse drugs again, and his\nyear-and-a-half of abstinence is a positive indicator, his track record to date gives one\npause vis-a-vis the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. This is particularly true in\nlight of the fact his efforts are self-initiated and without a support network. Had his\nresolve stood firm in April 2005, this judgment might be different. As it now stands,\nhowever, any residual doubt must be resolved by finding against an Applicant because\nthe clearly consistent standard indicates that \u201csecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  With security concerns remaining, clearance\n20\nis denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance is granted.\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn April 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 4, 2008, and elected to have his case\ndecided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on July 1, 2008.  Applicant did not submit any information in response\nto the FORM.  The case was assigned to me September 15, 2008.\nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n2\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested (a) on four different\noccasions between June 2003 and January 2007 on various charges related to\ndomestic violence, (b) once in February 2004 for no insurance (followed by the issuance\nof a warrant for failure to appear) and (c) once for possession of alcohol by a minor in\nMay 2006.\nUnder both Guidelines E and J, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his public\ntrust application (SF-85P) of April 2007 and his security clearance application (SF-86) of\nJuly 2007, by omitting the arrests covered in the SOR.\n For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations pertaining\nto his arrests anc associated charges with explanations.  He denied that a warrant was\nissued in connection with his 2004 arrest.  He claimed three of the charges were either\ndismissed or dropped (viz., subparagraphs 1.c, 1.d and 1.f). He never admitted nor\ndenied the allegations concerning his omissions of his arrests.  He did, however, claim\nthat he was told (source not identified) that all of the alleged charges would be\ndismissed and not show up on his record, and for this reason, he did not list them in his\nSF-86.  Applicant\u2019s explanations essentially deny any intentional omission, and will be\ntreated as pleading denials.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 22-year-old lawn seasonal maintenance worker for a defense\ncontractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted to by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional\nfindings follow.\nApplicant was arrested on a number of occasions between June 2003 and\nJanuary 2007 for assorted offenses.  Records show that he was arrested in June 2003\nand charged with simple assault/family violence and criminal trespassing.  He was\nplaced on pre-trial diversion and the charges were nolle prosequi in February 2006.  He\nwas arrested for no insurance in February 2004.  When he did not appear as scheduled,\na bench warrant reportedly was issued.  When Applicant appeared for his hearing, he\nwas issued a warning. \nBetween May 2005 and January 2007, he was arrested on three occasions for\ndomestic violence offenses and charged with battery/family violence.  Charges were\ndismissed relative to both of his May 2005 domestic violence arrests.  He was found\nguilty of battery/family violence relative to his January 2007 charges and fined\napproximately $400.00. He claims the charges were dismissed following his completion\nof an anger management course, but provides no documentation of the same.  \nApplicant\u2019s other arrest was alcohol-related.  Records show that in May 2006, he\nwas cited and charged with possession of alcohol by a minor.  He was found guilty and\n\n3\nfined approximately $480.00.  Applicant claims he does not drink anymore, but provides\nno witness or documentary support for his claims.\nWhen interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) in September 2007, Applicant described the covered domestic violence incidents\nas essentially quarrels that ended in some pushing and physical damage of his\ngirlfriend\u2019s apartment (see Item 6).   With respect to his May 2006 arrest, he recalled\nspending a night in jail and completing  in some cases and completing the work required\nby the court (item 6).  Applicant provides no further details of any of the covered\nincidents in the SOR. \nAsked to complete an SF-85P in April 2007, and an SF-86 in July 2007, Applicant\nomitted all of his arrests covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f.  He attributed his\nomissions of his 2003 and 2004 arrests to his claimed belief that he did not have to list\narrests that occurred when he was a minor.  He attributed his alcohol-related arrest to\nmemory lapse.  And he attributed his omissions of his 2005 and 2007 domestic violence\narrests to his belief that the charges stemming from these arrests were either dropped\nor dismissed, and hence did not need to be listed (see Answer and Item 6).  Applicant \u2018s\nexplanations do not provide a very credible explanation in their entirety.  His\nexplanations at the very least require more detail to be plausible. \nConsidering all of the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s omissions, his claims of\nmisunderstanding and inadvertent omission cannot be accepted as plausible and\ncredible explanations. Inferences warrant that Applicant\u2019s omissions were made\ndeliberately with the intent to mislead the Government.  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\n\n4\nCriminal Conduct \n The Concern.  Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  Adjudication Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 30.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\n\n5\nAnalysis  \nApplicant in this case was arrested and/or cited on six difference occasions over a\nfour-year period spanning 2003 and 2007 for assorted offenses ranging from driving\nwithout proof of insurance and failing to appear, possessing alcohol as a minor, and\ndomestic violence offenses (four in all).  He is also alleged to have committed criminal\nconduct in omitting his arrest/charges from both the SF-85P and SF-86 he completed in\n2007. Applicant\u2019s arrests/charges and omissions are probative based on the information\npresented in this record raise initial security concerns.  \nAppellant\u2019s admitted charges (some later dropped or dismissed) warrant\nconsideration under the criminal conduct guideline (\u00b6 30) of the AGs.  DC \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and DC \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\u201d\nhave application.\nWhile some of the covered charges may have been dropped or dismissed, they\nentail admitted criminal conduct that is neither aged nor isolated.  His conduct is too\nrecent and frequent to warrant application of any of the mitigating conditions of the\ncriminal conduct guideline. He provides no documentation either of character\nendorsements, work evaluations, or demonstrated work in the community that might aid\nin making a positive whole person assessment.  \nUse of a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s arrest history is insufficient to enable him to\nsurmount security concerns independent of the express disqualifying conditions covered\nby AG \u00b6 18.  Without proof of acquired maturity and a demonstrated change of direction\nin his life, it is difficult to draw convincing conclusions about his overall trustworthiness\nbased on factors not covered in the mitigation conditions of the guideline for financial\nconsiderations. \nBased on a consideration of the applicable guidelines and a limited  whole person\nassessment from the few details furnished by Applicant, unfavorable conclusions warrant\nwith respect to the allegations covered by the criminal conduct guideline. \nPotentially serious, too, and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability\nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s assorted arrests/charges in the SF-85P and SF-86 he completed in April and\nJuly 2007, respectively, and withholding the information until he was confronted in his\nensuing OPM interview.  So much trust is imposed on persons cleared to see classified\ninformation that deviation tolerances for candor lapses are gauged very narrowly. \nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with, since he failed to promptly correct his\nSF-86 understatements before being confronted in his ensuing OPM interview.  In the\npast, the Appeal Board has denied applicants availability of the predecessor mitigating\ncondition of MC 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\n\n6\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) where the\napplicant has waited many months to timely correct a known omission. Compare ISCR\nCase No. 97-0289 (Appeal Bd. January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (Appeal\nBd. January 1995).\nBy omitting his arrests/charges in both his SF-85P and SF-86, Applicant\nconcealed materially important background information needed for the government to\nproperly process and evaluate his security clearance application.  His attributed reasons\nfor his omissions (minor status, memory lapse, and impression that dropped or\ndismissed charges need no be listed) are not sustainable grounds for averting inferences\nof falsification.  Weighing all of the circumstances surrounding his SF-86 arrest/charge\nomissions and lack of any prompt, good faith corrections, Applicant\u2019s claims lack the\nnecessary probative showing to avert drawn conclusions that he knowingly and\ndeliberately withheld material background information about his prior use of illegal\nsubstances. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b.  Because Applicant\u2019s omissions are isolated and were\nfollowed by corrections when interviewed two months later, criminal conduct associated\nwith them are mitigated.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive. \nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT): \nAGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para.  1.g:\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 2.a and 2.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

His eligibility \nfor a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn August 3, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On June 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the \nsecurity concerns under the guidelines for Drug Involvement and Personal Conduct. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nOctober 21, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn June 30, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On July 18, 2008, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing five \nItems, and mailed Applicant a complete copy on July 21, 2008. Applicant signed the \ndocument acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM on August 6, 2008, and \nreturned it to DOHA. He provided no further response to the FORM within the 30-day \nperiod he was given to do so, did not request additional time to respond, and made no \nobjection to consideration of any evidence submitted by Department Counsel. I received \nthe case assignment on September 24, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in the SOR. \nThose admissions are incorporated into the findings herein.   \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old, married with two children. In November 2005, he began \nworking for a defense contractor. In August 2006, he submitted an e-QIP. (Item 4). \n \n \nIn response to Section 24(a) on the e-QIP that inquires into illegal drug activity, \nApplicant admitted that he used illegal drugs and estimated that he used marijuana, \nsocially, a couple times a month from June 1975 until August 2005. (Item 4 at 30). In \nresponse to Section 24(c), he denied ever purchasing illegal drugs.  In a September \n2007 interview with a government investigator, he disclosed that he used marijuana until \nJune 2006. Later in the interview, he admitted that the last time he used it was in June \n2007 after becoming distressed about his brother\u2019s divorce. (Item 5 at 14). He normally \nused the substance with friends because his wife does not approve of his drug use and \ndoes no know that he continues to use it. (Id. a 13). He no longer sees one of his \nfriends, who provided the marijuana, because the friend moved out of the area. (Id. at \n14). Applicant believes he will use it in the future. (Id.). He has not participated in any \nsubstance abuse counseling. (Id.). \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n\n \n3 \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d   \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe security concern pertaining to drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \n Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (a) Drugs are \ndefined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: (1) \nDrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in \nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and; (2) \ninhalants and other similar substances; (b) drug abuse is the illegal use of \na drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThis guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Based \non Applicant\u2019s admissions that he used marijuana about twice a month from \napproximately June 1975 until June 2007, the Government raised a disqualifying \ncondition under AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse (see above definition).\u201d \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of that disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe resulting security concerns.  Under AG \u00b6 26, four conditions are listed that could \nmitigate the security concern arising from illegal drug use: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged \nillness during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since \nended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.   \n Based on an evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n25(a) does not apply. Applicant used illegal drugs a couple times a month from June \n1975 until June 2007, the last incident being about a year ago. Given his 32-year history \nof marijuana use, his behavior does cast doubt on his trustworthiness and good \njudgment.   \nApplicant stated he may use the illegal substance in the future; hence AG \u00b6 25(b) \ndoes not apply. The record does not contain any evidence to support the application of \nAG \u00b6 25(c) or AG \u00b6 25(d).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged in \u00b6 2(a) of the SOR that Applicant deliberately falsified \nhis response to a government investigator about the length of time that he used \nmarijuana.  In \u00b6 2(b), the Government alleged that his answer in the e-QIP regarding his \npurchasing marijuana was inconsistent with his answer during the interview. The \nGovernment alleged in \u00b6 2(c) that he used marijuana after submitting his e-QIP. The \nGovernment contended that those omissions may raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying under AG \u00b6 15. \n \n AG \u00b6 16 sets out seven conditions that could raise security concerns and be \ndisqualifying. Two of them are applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \n \nApplicant admitted that he intentionally failed to initially disclose to the \ngovernment investigator the last date on which he smoked marijuana, but \ninstead, disclosed a date one year earlier (2006) before disclosing 2007. Based \non that admission, the Government established AG \u00b6 (16(a). Applicant also \nadmitted that he used marijuana for 32 years, which raises a potential for \nexploitation, because such information, if known in his community, could affect \nhis reputation, as noted under AG \u00b6 16 (e)(1).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAlthough Applicant admitted that he gave inconsistent answers regarding \nthe purchase of marijuana, the evidence does not support the admission. \nApplicant denied that he ever purchased marijuana in his response to Question \n24(c) on the e-QIP and also during his interview. Hence, his answers are not \ninconsistent as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b and this allegation is found in his favor.  \n \nApplicant did not provide any evidence that would trigger the application of \nany of the mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 17 as to the allegations \ncontained in \u00b6 2. a and \u00b6 2.c of  the SOR. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each \nguideline, the adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all \navailable, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate \nvariables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. In evaluating the \nconduct of the applicant, the administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 48-year-old married \nman, who began using marijuana in 1975 and continued using it until 2007, and after \ncompleting an e-QIP. While I find his candid admissions of his drug use noteworthy, his \nassertion that he may use marijuana in the future is very concerning and indicative of a \nlack of good judgment.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with significant questions as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct. \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",
