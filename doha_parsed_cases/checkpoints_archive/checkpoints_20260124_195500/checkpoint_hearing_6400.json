Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant has mitigated security concerns pertaining to Foreign Preference and \nForeign Influence. Clearance is granted. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 7, \n2004. On September 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines \nC (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence) for Applicant. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \nJune 24, 2008\n\n \n \n2\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 1, 2007. He answered \nthe SOR in writing on November 1, 2007, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on November 13, 2007. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on January 9, 2008, and I received the case \nassignment on January 10, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 16, \n2008, scheduling a hearing for March 11, 2008. DOHA issued an amended notice of \nhearing on February 21, 2008, rescheduling a hearing for March 27, 2008. The hearing \nwas held as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government offered three documents, which were admitted without \nobjections as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. The Applicant offered one \ndocuments, which was admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf. \n \nI held the record open to afford Applicant an opportunity to submit additional \nmaterial. Applicant timely submitted one document, which was admitted without \nobjection as AE B. DOHA received the transcript of the hearings (Tr.) on April 4, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request Exhibit (Ex.) I(A) that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts relating to Nigeria contained in Exs. I through V. As \nrequested and without objection, I took administrative notice of Exs. I(A) through V. Tr. \n17. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) \n(listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to Nigeria \nwere derived from documents offered by Department Counsel under subheading \n\u201cNigeria\u201d of this decision. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of \nFact, below.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n3\nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR dated November 1, 2007, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.d., and 2.a. and 2.b., but denied the factual \nallegations in 1.a. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of \nfact. \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old armed security officer. He has been employed by his \ngovernment contractor employer since November 2001. Tr. 46, GE 1. He is a first-time \napplicant for a security clearance and seeks a clearance to enhance his employment \npotential within his company. Tr. 46-47, 62.  \n \nApplicant was born in March 1977 in the U.S. to Nigerian parents and as such \nholds dual citizenship with the U.S. and Nigeria. Applicant\u2019s father was completing \ngraduate work in the U.S. from 1973 to 1977. Applicant is the second of four children \nborn to his parents. Applicant\u2019s older brother was also born in the U.S. in May 1973. \nApplicant has two younger siblings, a sister and a brother, who were born in Nigeria \nafter his parents returned home in 1977. \n \nAt the time Applicant moved with his parents to Nigeria, he was less than a year \nold. He was raised, educated, and spent his formative years in Nigeria. Applicant \ndescribes his upbringing in Nigeria as middle class. His father was a university \nprofessor and recently retired. Tr. 39-40. His mother is a career civil servant and \nexpects to retire in the near future. Tr. 41. His father is 64 years old, and his mother is \n57 years old. Tr. 41. Applicant\u2019s parents are financially secure and not dependent on \nhim for financial support. Tr. 41-42. Applicant also described both of his parents as \nbeing in good health. Tr. 65-66. None of Applicant\u2019s family members are agents of the \nNigerian government. \n \nIn 2001, at age 24, Applicant moved back to the U.S. permanently to pursue \nhigher education and find a job. Tr. 39. His older brother had previously returned to the \nU.S. to do the same and known owns his own medical equipment company. Applicant \nlives relatively close to his older brother and has frequent contact with him. Applicant\u2019s \nyounger sister lives in Canada and is employed as a customer service representative \nfor a cell phone company, and his younger brother is a full-time student and lives with \nhis parents in Nigeria. Tr. 52-53, 67-68. Applicant estimates he communicates with his \nparents about every two to three months by telephone. Tr. 53-55, 68-69. \n \nSince arriving in the U.S., Applicant earned an associate\u2019s degree from a \ncommunity college in May 2007. He is currently attending college on a part-time basis \nand anticipates earning a bachelor of science degree majoring in business \nadministration in 2010. Tr. 56, 60-61. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1 alleged security concerns under Guideline C, specifically that Applicant \nis a dual citizen of Nigeria and the U.S., that he possesses a Nigerian passport, that he \nused his Nigerian passport in 2004 in lieu of his U.S. passport when traveling to Nigeria, \n\n \n \n4\n                                                          \nand maintains a bank account in Nigeria with a balance of approximately $1,500.00. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.d.) Noted above, Applicant was born in the U.S. to Nigerian parents \nand returned to Nigeria with his parents as a very young child. As such, Applicant\u2019s dual \ncitizenship is based solely on his parents\u2019 citizenship. Applicant categorically stated he \nwould be willing to renounce his Nigerian citizenship. Tr. 59-60. Applicant\u2019s parents \nobtained Nigerian and U.S. passports for him when he was a minor. Applicant \nsurrendered his Nigerian passport to his Facility Security Officer on March 11, 2008. AE \nA. Applicant stated at the time he used his Nigerian passport in 2004 when traveling to \nNigeria, he was unaware that such use was a security concern. He closed his Nigerian \nbank account, which he estimated had a balance of approximately $600 to $700, on \nApril 8, 2008. AE B, Tr. 57-59, 70. \n \nSince moving to the U.S. in 2001, Applicant has visited Nigeria in August 2004 \nand December 2005. Tr. 50. Both visits were to visit family and a woman he had met in \nDecember 1999 while a student in Nigeria, who would later become his wife. He \nbecame engaged during his December 2005 visit. Tr. 24-25.  \n \nApplicant married his fianc\u00e9e in the U.S. in September 2006. His wife came to \nthe U.S. in July 2006 on a fianc\u00e9e visa and has a two year \u201cconditional green card.\u201d Tr. \n24.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and five siblings live and reside in Nigeria. Her father \npassed away when she was nine years old. Tr. 26-27, 33. She communicates with her \nfamily in Nigeria by telephone about every two weeks. Tr. 35. None of her family \nmembers are agents of the Nigerian government. Applicant\u2019s wife currently attends a \ncommunity college where she is studying English as a Second Language (ESL). Upon \ncompletion of her ESL coursework, she plans to pursue a nursing degree. Tr. 23. Her \nstated intention is to become a U.S. citizen when eligible. Tr. 31. \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s assets are in the U.S. He is registered to vote in the U.S. and \nexercises all rights of citizenship. Tr. 63-64. \n \nNigeria1  \n \nNigeria is a federal republic composed of 36 states and a capital territory. The \ngovernment\u2019s human rights record is poor, and government officials at all levels commit \nserious abuses including politically motivated and extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary \narrest and detention, infringement on privacy rights, freedom of speech, and press. \nAreas of the country are marked by serious instability and outbreaks of armed conflict \nbetween religious, political, and ethnic factions. The lack of law and order in the country \nposes considerable risks to travelers. \n \nThe Nigerian government provides strong diplomatic support to U.S. government \ncounter-terrorism efforts. It has condemned terrorist attacks against the United States \nand supported military actions against the Taliban and Al-Qaida. It also has played a \nleading role in forging an anti-terrorism consensus among states in their region. The \n \n1 The contents of the Nigeria section are from Exs. I(A) through V. \n\n \n \n5\n                                                          \nUnited States provides the people of Nigeria with substantial financial assistance in \nareas such as public health, education, and in their efforts of developing effective \ninstitutions of democratic governance. Nigeria is an important trading partner of the \nUnited States. There is no evidence of economic competition with the United States, or \nthat Nigeria has or ever had an intelligence gathering program targeting U.S. economic, \nindustrial, or military critical technologies.  \n \nPolicies \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must \nconsider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation\u201d (Guidelines). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each \nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and \nMitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the \nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole \nperson concept,\u201d an administrative judge considers all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nGuideline \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \n \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of national security.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d2 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \n \n \n2 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the \nrecord.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 \n\n \n \n6\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \na case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a \ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving \na mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at \n5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).3 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by \nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a \ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this \nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \nAnalysis \n  \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nGuideline \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and \ninterests\u201d stating, \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he \n \nE3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of \ndrawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] \nfinding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, \n380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n3 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both \nfavorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light \nof pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his \nburden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n \n7\n                                                          \nor she] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the \nforeign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information \nand/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d \n \nGuideline \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and,  \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.4 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with his parents and brother, who are resident \ncitizens of Nigeria. These contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation because there is always the possibility that Nigerian agents or criminals \nmay exploit the opportunity to obtain information about the United States. His \nconnection to his family members also create a potential conflict of interest because his \nrelationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire to help \nthem by providing sensitive or classified information. Applicant\u2019s wife is a Nigerian \ncitizen who is a resident alien and intends to file for U.S. citizenship at the earliest \nopportunity.  \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the government. \n \n4 See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n8\n                                                          \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and, \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant established \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of [his parents and brother] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d \nHis frequent contacts and close relationship with his family do not establish that he \ncould potentially be forced to choose between the United States and Nigeria. He did \nmeet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with his family] \ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  The closeness of the \nrelationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s telephone contacts with his parents, and his travels \nto Nigeria.  I do not believe Applicant\u2019s relationship with his parents and younger brother \nin Nigeria creates a heightened risk for foreign influence or exploitation. \n \n \nIn deciding whether Applicant\u2019s family members are in a position to be exploited, \nI considered Nigeria\u2019s form of government.5 Nigeria is a developing country that, so far, \npossesses no intelligence, economic, or industrial threat to the United States. \nNotwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s poor human rights record, there is no evidence its \ngovernment seeks classified and industrial/economic information from the United \nStates. Nor is there evidence of the Nigerian government mistreating relatives of U.S. \ncitizens or U.S. citizens to obtain such information. Additionally, given the existing \nrelationship between the governments of the United States and Nigeria, it is unlikely \nNigeria would risk losing an important trading partner and the financial support of the \nUnited States. \n \n \n \n5 The focus is not the country or its people, but its rulers and the nature of the \ngovernment they impose. This approach recognizes that it makes sense to treat each \ncountry in accordance with the level of security concern or threat it presents to the United \nStates.  \n \n\n \n \n9\nIt is noted Applicant\u2019s father is retired and his mother plans to retire soon, and his \nfamily live a low key life in Nigeria. The evidence did not show any connection between \nApplicant\u2019s parents and the internal ongoing problems in Nigeria. They are financially \nindependent and Applicant does not provide them with financial support. \n \nApplicant and his in-laws do not appear to have a particularly close relationship \nand what relationship he has is a vicarious one through his wife. No evidence was \ndeveloped suggesting his relationship with his mother-in-law or in-laws was anything \nother than casual and infrequent. His limited and infrequent contacts do not present a \nsecurity concern placing Applicant in the unlikely position of having to choose between \nhis in-laws and the interests of the United States.  \n \nGuideline \u00b6 8(b) applies because Appellant is sufficiently vested through family, \npersonal property, and socialization in the U.S.  As such, he is expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. Although raised in Nigeria, he and his \nolder brother chose to take up permanent residency in the U.S. when they reached \nadulthood. He has lived in the United States since 2001. He and his older brother are \nnative born U.S. citizens. Applicant has earned his associate\u2019s degree in the U.S. and is \nworking towards his bachelor\u2019s degree. His older brother owns his own business in the \nU.S. and lives relatively close to Applicant. His contacts and linkage to the U.S are \ngreater than his linkage to Nigeria as demonstrated by to his permanent return to the \nU.S. in 2001. He has staked his future on his life in the U.S. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nGuideline \u00b6 9 explains the Government\u2019s concern  \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in \nsuch a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then \nhe or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the Unites States.\u201d \n \n Guideline \u00b6 10 indicates one condition that raises a security concern and is \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport. \n \n \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 11 are \npotentially applicable to this disqualifying condition: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n\n \n \n10\n                                                          \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted documentation confirming he surrendered his Nigerian \npassport to his Facility Security Officer. He also expressed a willingness to renounce his \nNigerian citizenship. At the time he used his Nigerian passport when traveling to Nigeria \nin 2004, he was unaware such use had the potential to create a later security concern. \nWhen he became aware his holding a Nigerian passport was a security concern, he \npromptly surrendered it to his Facility Security Officer. Applicant also closed his Nigerian \nbank account. AGs 11(a) through (e) are applicable. In light of Applicant\u2019s affirmative \nsteps to comply with the Directive and explanations provided, this concern is deemed \nmitigated. \n \nWhole Person Analysis  \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d6 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the \neighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.7 In addition to the \neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense \ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.     \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \n \n6 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. \n02-01093 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, \n2007) (citing Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate \nevents may have a significance that is missing when each event is viewed in isolation). \n \n \n7 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an \nanalysis under the eighth APF apparently without discussion of the other APFs was \nsustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (sole APF mentioned is \neighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of \nclearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for exploitation\u201d), but see \nISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that eighth APF \nis exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n \n\n \n \n11\n                                                          \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. He is a U.S.-born citizen and returned to the U.S. as a young adult to attend \ncollege and has lived continuously in the U.S. for seven years. His older brother is also \nU.S-born resident citizen.  His father is retired and his mother is about to retire, and his \nfamily in Nigeria lead a low key life. His ties to the United States are stronger than his \nties to family members in Nigeria. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action \nwhich could cause potential harm to the United States. He takes his loyalty to the United \nStates seriously, and he has worked diligently for a government contractor since \nNovember 2001. There is nothing in the record to suggest he is anything but a loyal, \ntrustworthy, conscientious, responsible, and a mature individual, who is making a \ncontribution to society and the U.S. No derogatory evidence was presented which \nsupported denial of his security clearance nor was any derogatory information \npresented about him. Applicant has fully cooperated in the process and taken all \nreasonable and achievable steps to mitigate security concerns raised.  \n    \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990).  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence and foreign preference.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d8 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has \nnot mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he \nis eligible for access to classified information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n8 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

On August 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline J for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 13, 2007. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on September 21, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request the same day. Department Counsel\nwas prepared to proceed on October 12, 2007. I received the case assignment on\nOctober 17, 2007, after it was transferred from another judge who had received it two\ndays earlier. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 7, 2007, and I convened\nJanuary 17, 2008\n\n2\nthe hearing as scheduled on November 28, 2007. The government offered Exhibits\n(Exh.) 1 through 4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on her own\nbehalf and submitted one exhibit (Exh. A) which was admitted without objection.\nApplicant requested that the record be left open until December 28, 2007, for\nsubmission of additional evidence. A submission with five documents was timely\nreceived (Exh. B) and admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on December 6, 2007.Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, testimony, and the applicable statutory provision relating to an applicant who\nhas served over one year in confinement (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 986) eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR,\nwith explanations.\nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor who works in a\ntemporary position as a data processor without a security clearance. She worked as a\ncivilian employee of the Army for 25 years and retired in 1998. During the latter part of\nher employment she was introduced to marijuana and occasionally used it. Once it was\nlaced with crack cocaine and after once disliking it intensely, used it again with a\nfrequency of approximately once a month (Tr. 22-25). After her retirement she became\ninvolved with friends who introduced her to drug sales. One stored marijuana in her\nhouse and another asked her to purchase drugs for him and she did so. This person\nwas a DEA undercover informant and this led to the charges at issue in this case.\nApplicant was arrested by agents of the Drug Enforcement Agency on or about\nSeptember 27, 1999, when she was 48-years-old and charged with six cocaine related\ncounts including conspiracy with intent to distribute, conspiracy to distribute, and\ndistribution. Her trial was delayed for two years during which time she became ill, was\nhospitalized, and diagnosed with congestive heart failure. She received a heart\npacemaker. For more than one year before trial, she was allowed to live on her own and\nparticipated in alcohol and drug rehabilitation programs until she appeared in court (Tr.\n24). \nApplicant pleaded guilty to one count of distribution of cocaine base on July 25,\n2002 and was sentenced in October 2002 to 30 months imprisonment. She was fined\n$100, ordered to take 500 hours of a residential drug addiction program (RDAP), which\nshe completed. She was given three years of supervised release. The remaining\ncharges were dismissed. She spent one month in a U.S. Marshal\u2019s confinement facility\nand another year in a federal corrections facility. She was then moved to a halfway\nhouse for six months, and on May 21, 2004, was placed on supervised release for three\nyears. Her probation officer requested early release (Exh. B 4 and 5) and she was\ndischarged early on August 4, 2005, by order of the U.S. District Court (Exh. B 6). After\nshe was released from supervised probation in 2005, her doctor would not immediately\n\n3\napprove her return to work because of her heart condition, but she obtained approval to\nwork and did so in January 2006.\nApplicant\u2019s drug rehabilitation efforts have been successful and she has been\ndrug free since 2002. She receives $800 per month from her federal retirement. When\nshe is fully employed she receives $700 every two weeks from her employer. Her\nimmediate family is a son who is 37 years old. He is successfully employed, supportive\nof his mother, and visits her often. She was very devoted to her mother who died while\nshe was in prison. This loss caused her to regret her conduct even more. She has\nseveral brothers and sisters who are supportive of her rehabilitation. She deeply regrets\nthe conduct that led to her conviction and knows that it was wrong and that she\ndeserved the punishment imposed. She no longer has any contact with the people with\nwhom she consorted when her legal difficulties occurred or others who might lead her\ninto further misconduct. \nApplicant is well regarded by her supervisor at work who finds her dedicated and\nprofessional in her work (Exh. B 2). She is also supported by a friend of 20 years who\nhas gone through her difficult times with her and concludes that she is on the right track\n(Exh. B 3). The attorney for Applicant in her criminal case has known her since 1999\nand vouches for her truthfulness and moral values (Exh. A). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.\nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns for an\napplicant. One of them that may be a disqualifying condition (DC) is a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses (AG \u00b6 31 a). However, the most pertinent DC is a\nconviction in a federal or state court of a crime that results in a sentence of\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year and incarceration as a result of that\nsentence for not less than a year (AG \u00b6 31 f). The evidence in this case is sufficient to\nraise these disqualifying conditions.\nPossible mitigating factors under the guideline that could be applicable are that\nso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened that it does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment (AG \u00b6 32 a), or\nthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation including but not limited to passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse, and a good employment record (AG \u00b6\n32 d). However, neither can be applied because of the confinement for more than one\nyear. \n\n5\nThe history of the section of the guideline concerning sentences originated in a\nlaw enacted by Congress in 2000 (18 U.S.C.\u00a7 986 c 1) and amended in 2004. It\nprohibited the Department of Defense from granting or renewing a security clearance for\ncertain persons falling into four categories. The statute is applicable to a person who\nhas been convicted in any U.S. court of a crime, and was incarcerated as a result of that\nsentence for not less than one year. Applicant spent over one year in confinement as a\nresult of her conviction. Thus she is disqualified from holding a security clearance. An\nexception is provided and a security clearance may be granted if an applicant receives\na waiver from the Secretary of Defense or his designee (AG & 31 f). \nThe law authorizes a waiver lin a meritorious case if there are mitigating factors.\nWaivers may be granted by the Director of DOHA pursuant to a delegation of authority\nin accordance with Operating Instruction (OI 64) The instruction limits the administrative\njudge\u2019s responsibility to determinating if the law applies to facts of the case and\nprovides that the judge may not make a recommendation of any kind.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nWhile Applicant has shown evidence of successful rehabilitation as a result of her\nconviction, she has been out of prison for only two and a half years and has been\nemployed for only a little over one year. She was a mature woman with 25 years of\nfederal service in a military department when the offense occurred. She knows that the\npunishment was justified. She greatly regrets the conduct that caused her to lose\nseveral years of her life including the last years of being with her mother. She no longer\nconsorts with the people whom she knew during the time of the trouble nor with others\nlike them. She is not in the best of health yet now works in the defense industry in an\neffort to make a contribution to society.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, I conclude that Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from her criminal conduct since she served over\none year in confinement as a result of her conduct and the sentence imposed for it. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:Against Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n_________________\nCHARLES D. ABLARD\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 67-year-old married man with four adult children. He has a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering. He has worked in the defense contracting industry since finishing college in 1965, and has continuously held a security clearance since 1967. Currently, Applicant is a mechanical development group supervisor. He is highly respected by his colleagues. According to his supervisor, he has a stellar performance record, and is \u201can outstanding role model for his employees [who] fosters a very inclusive, positive environment for them\u201d (Exhibit G). A former subordinate described Applicant as \u201ca driving force in [his] career\u201d whose advice he continues to seek (Exhibit I). In 2007, Applicant received an award from his employer for outstanding ethical conduct (Exhibit G). In the mid-to late 1980s, Applicant\u2019s wife was charged criminally with embezzling $250,000 over an approximate five-year period from her then-employer, a jewelry store owner (Tr. 34, 86). Two successive trials ended in mistrials (Tr. 35). Shortly after the prosecution began preparing for a third trial, Applicant\u2019s wife decided to make a plea admitting that the state had enough evidence to convict her, but maintaining her innocence (Tr. 35) The court then ordered her to pay restitution (Tr. 49). Applicant\u2019s wife did not report the money that she had illegally obtained from her employer to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In 1995, after she entered the plea, the IRS audi",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn, April 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 9, 2008, admitting the allegations and\nrequesting a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 6, 2008. The next day,\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling it for September 8, 2008. During the\nhearing, I received 10 government exhibits, 12 Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony. At the hearing\u2019s conclusion, I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s request to\nallow him to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, Applicant submitted\nthree additional exhibits. Department counsel had no objections to their admissibility,\nOctober 8, 2008\n\nThis nearly led to the breakup of their marriage. They separated for a year, then reconciled after attending marital\n1\ncounseling (Tr. 35).\n2\nand I incorporated them into the record. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on\nSeptember 15, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 67-year-old married man with four adult children. He has a\nbachelor of science degree in electrical engineering. He has worked in the defense\ncontracting industry since finishing college in 1965, and has continuously held a security\nclearance since 1967. \nCurrently, Applicant is a mechanical development group supervisor. He is highly\nrespected by his colleagues. According to his supervisor, he has a stellar performance\nrecord, and is \u201can outstanding role model for his employees [who] fosters a very\ninclusive, positive environment for them\u201d (Exhibit G). A former subordinate described\nApplicant as \u201ca driving force in [his] career\u201d whose advice he continues to seek (Exhibit\nI). In 2007, Applicant received an award from his employer for outstanding ethical\nconduct (Exhibit G).\nIn the mid-to late 1980s, Applicant\u2019s wife was charged criminally with embezzling\n$250,000 over an approximate five-year period from her then-employer, a jewelry store\nowner (Tr. 34, 86). Two successive trials ended in mistrials (Tr. 35). Shortly after the\nprosecution began preparing for a third trial, Applicant\u2019s wife decided to make a plea\nadmitting that the state had enough evidence to convict her, but maintaining her\ninnocence (Tr. 35) The court then ordered her to pay restitution (Tr. 49).\nApplicant\u2019s wife did not report the money that she had illegally obtained from her\nemployer to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In 1995, after she entered the\nplea, the IRS audited her back tax returns, and concluded she owed an additional\n$98,000 (Tr. 98). Because Applicant and his wife filed joint tax returns, he became\njointly responsible for the income tax debt.1\nApplicant neither participated in his wife\u2019s criminal scheme nor had knowledge of\nit before she was charged. During the entire period it occurred, she told Applicant that\nher father was gifting her the money to help them cover the expenses from the\nextensive renovation of a 200-year-old house which they had purchased (Tr. 88; Exhibit\n10 at 3).\nIn November 1997, the IRS obtained a lien against Applicant\u2019s property for\n$98,104, and levied his entire 401k account (Exhibit 2; Answer, SOR \u00b6 1.a; Exhibit K;\nTr. 38). The trustee of the 401k account then distributed $12,704 to the IRS.\n\n3\nBetween December 1997 and March 1999, Applicant made $500 monthly\npayments toward the lien\u2019s satisfaction (Exhibit 7 at 7-8). Then, he began negotiating an\noffer in compromise (Ex 4 at 2). At the instruction of an IRS representative, he\nsuspended his monthly payments while negotiating the offer in compromise (Tr. 64-65;\nExhibit 4 at 3). In approximately 2001, Applicant\u2019s efforts at negotiating an offer in\ncompromise failed because he was unable to afford the proposed lump sum payment\n(Tr. 36,100-101). He did not resume monthly payments. Each year, the IRS applied\nsuccessive income tax refunds to the delinquency ranging between two and five\nthousand dollars (Exhibit 7 at 8). Applicant\u2019s repayment strategy has been to primarily\nuse his refunds to satisfy the delinquency (Tr. 41). He attempted to maximize the\namount of these yearly refunds by intentionally not claiming many deductions on his\nincome tax returns (Id.).\nIn February 2006, the IRS garnished Applicant\u2019s wages for $22,265 (Exhibit O).\nEach week, $1,188.27 of Applicant\u2019s wages was applied to the delinquency (Exhibit 10\nat 3). By July 2006, Applicant satisfied the garnishment.\nIn March 2008, the IRS, certifying that Applicant had satisfied all of his back\ntaxes and any statutory additions, released the lien (Exhibit A). Applicant contends that\nalthough the lien was released, he still owes the IRS approximately $21,000 in\npenalties. He has continued to attempt to make payments, but the debt is no longer\nenforceable because the 10-year statute of limitations for collecting federal tax\ndelinquencies has expired (Tr. 43). Applicant consulted a tax attorney about paying this\nremainder. His attorney told him that his only alternative was to continue paying the\ndebt informally and to instruct the IRS to deposit these additional payments into the\ngeneral tax fund (Tr. 43). There is no other record evidence regarding a possible\noutstanding delinquency other than Applicant\u2019s testimony and a spreadsheet he\nprepared by hand (Exhibit L).\nAs of January 2008, Applicant had not filed his federal and state income taxes for\ntax years 2005 and 2006 (Answer, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c). He has had an ongoing problem\nwith filing taxes timely since his wife opened a seasonal antiques business in the late\n1990s. She is not a good record keeper, and the problem is compounded because she\nmaintains her records in the state where she operates the business, hundreds of miles\nfrom their home (Tr. 45). Because her records are \u201ca jumble,\u201d Applicant procrastinates\n(Tr. 45). Recently, Applicant retained a tax attorney to help organize his wife\u2019s financial\nrecords (Id.).\nOn June 4, 2008, Applicant filed his 2005 federal income tax return (Exhibit D).\nHe received a $3,364 refund that he instructed the IRS to apply to the general tax fund\n(Exhibit D). On September 4, 2008, Applicant filed his 2006 federal income tax return\n(Exhibit C). He anticipates a $5,818 refund that he has instructed the IRS to apply to the\ngeneral tax fund (Id. at 2). \n\n4\nOn May 12, 2008, Applicant filed his 2005 state income tax return (Exhibit E). He\nreceived a $2,007 refund (Id. at 2). He filed his 2006 state income tax return in\nSeptember 2008, and anticipates a $2,177 refund (Exhibit B).\nApplicant earns a salary of $136,000 per year (Tr. 68). His pension pays him an\nadditional $25,000 per year (Tr. 69). He is also collecting social security, which pays\nhim $2,100 per month (Tr. 70). He maintains a $2,000 balance in his checking account\nand his wife earns $65,000 per year (Tr. 73). A November 2006 credit report reflects no\nderogatory information other than the tax lien which he has since satisfied (Exhibit 5).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s longstanding tax delinquency and his late return filings trigger the\napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquency was unrelated to any bad judgment, irresponsibility,\nor inability to manage finances. Instead, it accrued because of his wife\u2019s malfeasance.\nHe has satisfied the lien through monthly payments, wage and retirement account\ngarnishments, and the application of successive income tax refunds to the delinquency.\nGiven Applicant\u2019s salary, he probably could have satisfied the delinquency\nsooner. He only made monthly, voluntary payments for 16 months. Nevertheless, I\nconclude he acted reasonably. He stopped the monthly payments at the instruction of\nan IRS representative to focus on negotiating an offer in compromise. When the IRS\nrejected the offer in compromise, he then began satisfying the delinquency by\nstructuring his salary withholdings to maximize the amount of refunds he would receive\neach tax year, and applying each annual refund to the delinquency. \nUnlike the tax delinquency, Applicant\u2019s failure to file his 2005 and 2006 federal\nand state income tax returns timely is solely related to his irresponsibility. He identified\nthe problem, retained a tax attorney to help organize his records, and filed all of his\nreturns. He received refunds for each of the late tax years. AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nApplicant earns a $136,000 annual salary, and an additional $45,000 annually in\npension and social security benefits. He currently has no financial delinquencies. He\nhas mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d \nThe amount of Applicant\u2019s tax delinquency was significant. He satisfied it, and he\nfiled the late income tax returns. Given his current financial well-being and the steps he\nhas taken to organize his financial records, the risk of recurrence is minimal.\n\n6\nDepartment counsel argues that because Applicant never paid $21,000 of the tax\nlien, its release does not satisfy the government\u2019s security concern. The only evidence\nthat the lien was not satisfied completely was provided by Applicant. Moreover, he has\nbeen receiving refunds since the release, and attempting to apply them to the remaining\ndeficiency even though he is no longer legally responsible. The positive security\ninference generated by his disclosure of this information and the steps to satisfy the\npotentially outstanding delinquency outweigh any potentially negative security\nimplications. Evaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude\nthat Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance should be granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Blank, Jr., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n February 25, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn August 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines B, C, and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing, and requested an Administrative\nDetermination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel issued a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) on October 24, 2007. Applicant did not respond to the\nFORM. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\n\nSee, SOR Response. Applicant stated in Exhibit 5 that \u201cthe Jordanian government charges non-citizens\n1\nsubstantial visitor fees and you\u2019re required to submit immigration documents monthly.\u201d\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant was born in the United States in 1984. When he was about 12 years of\nage, he moved to Jordan. He lived in Jordan from May 1996 to August 2002. He then\nreturned to the United States.\nBecause of his father\u2019s Jordanian citizenship, applicant is automatically\nconsidered a citizen of Jordan. Applicant exercised his Jordanian citizenship in 1990\nwhen he applied for and received a Jordanian passport. He renewed this passport in\n2006. Although applicant holds a United States passport, he uses his Jordanian\npassport when he visits Jordan \u201cbecause using an American passport would incur [sic]\nundue stress and financial burden.\u201d  He maintains his Jordanian citizenship because it\n1\nis part of his culture.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and five siblings are dual citizens of Jordan and the United\nStates, and they all currently reside in Jordan. His father operates a business there and\nhis mother is an editor for a foreign newspaper. Applicant is in contact with his family in\nJordan at least once a week via email or telephone.\nDuring an interview with a DoD investigator in October 2006, applicant stated he\n\u201cwould like to live in Jordan at some point within the next ten years.\u201d The Government\nalleges that during the same interview, applicant failed to disclose he had traveled to\nJordan in July 2006, and that while there, got married. Because there is no credible\nevidence that applicant was asked any question that would have required disclosure of\nthis information, this allegation, and Guideline E, are found for applicant.\nThe Government provided seven official United States publications with the\nFORM that describe the economic, political and intelligence activities of Jordan. The\nGovernment requested that these documents be admitted into evidence. I have\nadmitted the documents into evidence, and I take administrative notice of the following\nfacts found therein:\nJordan, which has a population of approximately 5.9 million, is a constitutional\nmonarchy that is pro-Western. Although the government respected human rights in\nsome areas, its overall record continued to reflect problems. While in Jordan, American\ncitizens who also possess Jordanian nationality may be subject to laws that impose\nspecial obligations on Jordanian citizens.\nCombating terrorism has been a major problem for Jordan. United States\npersonnel and assets in Jordan have been targeted by terrorists in recent years.\nTerrorists use overt, covert, and clandestine activities to exploit and undermine United\nStates national security interests.\n\n3\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\n \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Influence guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 6 of the AG, and is as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\n\n4\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nParagraph 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.a., \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.b.,\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information\u201d may be disqualifying. Lastly, under Paragraph 7.i., \u201cconduct,\nespecially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country\u201d\nmay be disqualifying.\nApplicant has at least weekly contact with his immediate family members residing\nin Jordan. In addition, since moving back to the United States in 2002, he has visited\nJordan numerous times, the last time in 2006 according to the evidence in the record.\nApplicant\u2019s presence in Jordan during these trips made him and his family members\npotentially vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by not only the Jordanian\ngovernment, but also by terrorists operating in Jordan. These facts raise concerns\nunder all three disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 8 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph 8.a., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Under Paragraph 8.b., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual*s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Lastly, under Paragraph 8.c., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate that the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d\nNone of the foregoing mitigating conditions is applicable. Applicant*s contacts\nwith his parents and siblings in Jordan are frequent and ongoing. His relationship with\nthem is one of loyalty and obligation, raising the concern that these relationships create\na risk for foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant failed to provide credible evidence\nthat it is unlikely he would be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign government and the interests of the United States, or that he is not\nvulnerable to a conflict of interest.\n\n5\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Preference guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 9 of the AG, and is as follows:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nParagraph 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 10.a.1., exercising any right or privilege of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member, such as possession of a current foreign passport, may be disqualifying.\nUnder Paragraph 10.b., taking action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign\ncitizenship by an American citizen may also be disqualifying. The fact that applicant\napplied for and received a Jordanian passport, and then renewed it while an adult,\nrequires application of these two conditions.\nParagraph 11 describes potentially mitigating conditions. The only one applicable\nis 11a., which states, \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\na foreign country.\u201d\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant was born in the United States to Jordanian parents. Although he has\nspent most of his life in the United States, he has strong ties to Jordan and to his\nimmediate family members living there, as evidenced by his voluntary weekly contacts\nwith these family members and his voluntary trips to Jordan. His voluntary actions could\nleave him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure and could cause the future\n\n6\ncompromise of classified information. I have carefully reviewed the administrative\nrecord, applicant*s submissions, and the allegations in the SOR. I have weighed the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and I have evaluated\napplicant*s conduct in light of the whole person concept identified at Paragraph E2.2. of\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive. After doing so, I conclude that applicant failed to rebut the\nGovernment\u2019s case under Guidelines B and C.\nThere is nothing in the record that suggests applicant is anything but a loyal\nAmerican citizen. Applicant*s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these\nproceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that industrial\nsecurity clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Therefore,\nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in\nwhole or in part, on any express or implied concern as to applicant*s allegiance, loyalty,\nor patriotism.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Finding no error,\nwe affirm.\nThe Judge found Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of alcohol and drug abuse.\nApplicant had consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication, from\napproximately 1972 to at least 2006.  He had been arrested for DWI in 1997, although the charge\nwas ultimately dismissed.  Applicant had used marijuana, at times daily, from approximately 1977\nto at least 1988, and he had used cocaine, at times monthly, from approximately 1977 to 2004.  He\nhad used cocaine while holding a security clearance, and he had tested positive for cocaine in a\nrandom drug test at his employment in 2004.  In 1986, Applicant had received outpatient treatment\nfor a condition diagnosed in part as alcohol abuse and poly-pharmacy abuse.  Although his prognosis\nhad been good, Applicant had resumed drinking alcohol and using marijuana approximately six\nmonths after completing the program.  The Judge also found Applicant had made a series of\nmisstatements and omissions about his alcohol and drug use in three signed, sworn statements to\ngovernment investigators.\n The Board has examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole and concludes\nthat the Judge has drawn \u201ca rational connection between the facts found\u201d under Guidelines G, H and\nE and his adverse decision.

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn August 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 10, 2007, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was assigned to me on October 10, 2007, and was scheduled for\nhearing on November 8, 2007.  A hearing was held on November 8, 2007, for the\npurpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the\nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n2\nGovernment's case consisted of eight exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nand one exhibit.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on December 4, 2007.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nPrior to the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to (1) delete\nthe words \u201calcohol dependence\u201d from subparagraph 1.b and replace with \u201calcohol\nabuse\u201d and (2) add Guideline E allegations to allege falsification of (a) signed, sworn\nstatements in August and September 1990 and again in April 1997 by concealing his\ncontinued use of marijuana after his stated July 1986 cut-off and (b) a signed, sworn\nstatement of April 1997 by denying he drank any alcoholic beverages prior to his being\narrested for driving under the influence (DuI) in January 1997.  There being no objection\nfrom Applicant, and good cause being demonstrated, Department Counsel\u2019s motion was\ngranted.  Applicant denied the amended allegations of the SOR. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have (a) consumed alcohol to excess\nand to intoxication from 1969 to 1972 and until at least 2006, (b) received inpatient\ntreatment from June 1986 until August 1986 for diagnosed alcohol dependence, and \u00a9)\nbeen arrested in January 2007 for aggravated DuI (dismissed). \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant is alleged to have (I) used marijuana daily from\n1977 to at least 1985, (ii) used cocaine monthly from 1977 to August 2004, (iii) received\noutpatient treatment for alcohol abuse and poly-pharmacy abuse, and (d) tested positive\nfor cocaine in a random drug test in August 2004.\nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations covering\nhis involvement with alcohol and illegal drugs.  Applicant provided explanations to his\ncovered use of alcohol and illegal drugs, acknowledging his use of alcohol and drugs as\nstated. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old facilities technician for a defense contractor who seeks\nto retain his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant was introduced to alcohol in high school.  Between 1977 and 1980\n(while in the military), he  consumed approximately a six-pack of beer a day. During this\nsame period, he also used marijuana on a daily basis, and cocaine monthly (R.T., at 42-\n43).  Contemporaneously, he tried other drugs as well.  Once discharged from the\nmilitary, he went to work for his father\u2019s construction company and tried tech school.  He\nwas forced to withdraw from his school studies, however, when his wife became\npregnant (R.T., at 44).  Over the course of the ensuing six years (between 1980 and\n\n3\n1986), he did not drink every day, but when he did drink, he usually drank to intoxication\n(R.T., at 44-45).  When he felt additional pressures from his marriage, he would some\ntimes drink before going to work (R.T., at 45).  Applicant admits to using marijuana daily\nduring this six-year period, as well as cocaine (although not as much).  \nIn June 1986, Applicant voluntarily admitted himself to an inpatient treatment\nfacility (CU Hospital).  Upon admission, he was diagnosed by a certified physician with\nalcohol and poly pharmacy abuse and admitted for detoxification (see ex. 8).  After\nsuccessful detoxification, he was transferred to adult rehabilitation, where he was\ntreated for family dysfunction, chemical dependency, and a lack of a recovery program.\nWhile in treatment, Applicant attended all required individual and group sessions and\nwas credited with interacting well and making considerable progress (see ex. 8; R.T., at\n46).  He was discharged in August 1986 with a favorable prognosis and a\nrecommended post-discharge regimen of 90 AA/NA meetings in 90 days, sustained\navoidance of alcohol and all mood altering substances, continued work on family\nrelationships, and advised outside therapy as necessary (ex. 8; R.T., at 47).\nFollowing his 1986 hospital discharge, Applicant utilized outpatient treatment for\na brief time and maintained sobriety for 4 to 6 months before relapsing into both alcohol\nconsumption and marijuana/cocaine use, some times binging on cocaine (R.T., at 47-\n48, 63).  Around 1989, he was ticketed for having an open container in his vehicle and\npaid a fine (R.T., at 48-49). While he continued to consume alcohol on a regular basis\nafter his discharge, he stopped using marijuana altogether around 1988 (see ex. 6).\nIn January 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated DuI after\nhe failed to provide police with a sufficient breath sample.  He had consumed a number\nof drinks at a local bar and was driving home when he was stopped by police (R.T., at\n53-54).  When he failed an administered sobriety test at the scene, he was escorted to\nthe local police station for further testing.  Once in court, the DuI charges were\ndismissed due to the likely malfunctioning of the breathalyzer.  Based on his admitted\nthree beers before his arrest, though, the incident qualifies as an alcohol-related\nincident, despite the dismissal of the charges.\nFor a number of years following his 1997 DuI arrest, Applicant continued to drink\non a regular basis, sometimes to intoxication (see ex. 3; R.T., at 56).  Tired of the\nhangovers, which could sometimes last up to one week after a week of binge drinking\nepisodes, he began curtailing his drinking in the 2002 time period.  Between 2002 and\n2004, he consumed a six-pack of beer a week on average, and rarely any mixed drinks\n(ex. 3; R.T., at 64-65).  Since his 2004 positive drug test, he not only ceased using\nillegal drugs, but he reduced his alcohol consumption even further: \u201cmaybe once every\ntwo weeks\u201d he estimates (R.T., at 66).\nDespite his denials of returning to any kind of sustained use of illegal substances\n(such as cocaine and marijuana) after giving up drugs in 1988, he is on record for\ntesting positive for cocaine in August 2004 (see ex. 6; R.T., at 59). In a September 2006\nOPM interview, he admitted to using cocaine for about two weeks before his positive\n\n4\ndrug test and  purchasing 4 to 5 lines of cocaine at a party and snorting the same a\ncouple days before the test (see ex. 3; R.T., at 60-62).  He assures that he has not used\nany form of illegal drugs since his positive drug test (R.T., at 64). Applicant\u2019s claims\nraise credibility issues that require careful consideration.\nIn two signed sworn statements given to a DSS investigator in August and\nSeptember 1990, respectively (see exs. 4 and 5), Applicant stated that he had not used\nor purchased marijuana since July 1986.  He admits to making these misstatements but\ndid not know why he made them (R.T., at 51).  He was just as uncertain about his\ndenied use of any alcohol preceding his January 1997 DuI arrest when he answered\nquestions from an OPM agent in April 1997 (see ex.6; R.T., at 56-57).  Only when\nconfronted about pre-arrest alcohol consumption by the same OPM agent in an ensuing\ninterview in June 1997 did he admit to having three beers before his DuI arrest and\nattribute his omissions to concerns that his being honest about his alcohol use might\nhurt his case (see ex. 7; R.T., at 58).  \nIn a more recent OPM interview in June 2006, Applicant provided a complete\nhistory of his alcohol and drug use for the interviewing agent (see ex. 3).  He provided\nno explanations for his previous misstatements and omissions about his use of alcohol\nand illegal drugs.  I view the 2006 OPM interview as a more credible account of\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol and drug history than those previously provided the DSS investigator\nand OPM agent who interviewed Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s series of misstatements and omissions about his alcohol and drug\nuse in the signed, sworn statements he signed for DSS and OPM are admitted and\nprobative of determined withholding of adverse information about his alcohol and drug\nuse.  His omissions are neither isolated nor explained and mask far more serious\nalcohol and drug use than he was willing to acknowledge in his earlier interviews.\nConsidering all of the circumstances of his noted misstatements, they cannot be\nexcused as inadvertent.  They reflect a pattern of misstatements and omissions of\nmaterial information about his recurrent alcohol and drug use that was material to an\ninvestigation of security eligibility, and both knowing and wilful under all of the\ncircumstances considered.\nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisors.  He is described as a skilled\nworker and a very reliable and dependable team member who is respected by his fellow\nco-workers (see ex. A). \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the Mitigating Conditions, if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\n\n5\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness (Adjudicative Guidelines, paragraph 21). \nDrug Involvement\nThe Concern: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions\nregarding an individual\u2019s willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug\nabuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk\nof an unauthorized disclosure of classified information (Adjudicative Guidelines,\nparagraph 24).\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process (Adjudicative Guidelines, paragraph 15). \nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of\nrecord.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on\nspeculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a highly regarded electronics technician for a defense contractor with\na history of regular alcohol consumption and illegal drug use over a 30-year period.\nSecurity concerns are raised, too, over Applicant\u2019s misstatements and omissions\nregarding the extent of his alcohol and drug use in a series of interviews with\nGovernment investigators.\nAlcohol issues\nOver the course of 30-years, Applicant consumed alcohol abusively to the point\nof intoxication.   After a brief respite from abusive drinking following his discharged from\ninpatient treatment in 1986, Applicant returned to heavy drinking, that included binge\ndrinking with hangovers that sometimes lasted as long as a week.  His excessive\ndrinking contributed to a DuI arrest in January 1997. Although the charges were\nsubsequently dismissed, the incident qualifies as an alcohol-related incident.  True, he\nhas managed to curtail his drinking since about 2002.  However, he has not obtained\nany kind of renewed diagnosis and prognosis to check his ability to limit his alcohol\nintake in the future.  \nOn the strength of the evidence presented, several disqualifying conditions (DC)\nof the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption may be applied: 22(a) \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d and\n22(c) \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent.\u201d \nBecause Applicant\u2019s drinking has never received any revised diagnosis since\n1986 and ensuing relapse, his previous diagnosis of alcohol abuse has some current\nassessment value. Accordingly, both 22(d) \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical\n\n7\nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or\nalcohol dependence\u201d and 22(f) \u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence\nand completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program\u201d have some application to the facts\nat hand. \nTo his credit, Applicant has curtailed his drinking for the past several years and\nhas not been involved in any alcohol-related incident since 1997.  Because his most\nserious periods of alcohol abuse (between 1977 and 2002) involved heavy binge\ndrinking at times and contemporaneous use of illegal substances (mostly marijuana and\ncocaine), his continued drinking retains some cause for concern.  However, his failure to\nseek a recent evaluation and enlist substance abuse counseling for any identified\nalcohol problem to date, his acknowledged binge drinking in the past, his\nunderstatements of his alcohol consumption, and his failure to furnish a more recent\nfavorable prognosis create a confluence of troubling concerns that preclude application\nof  any of the mitigating conditions of the guidelines for alcohol. Applicant\u2019s renewed\ncommitment to abstinence does reflect positive changes in behavior supportive of\nsobriety, and for these efforts Applicant is to be commended.  Favorable views of his\nprogress from work colleagues who know him are also helpful in gauging the strength of\nhis commitment to sobriety. \nTaking into account both Appellant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse and his strong work\nrecord, his mitigation efforts to date, while encouraging, reflect insufficient evaluative\ninformation and evidence of sustained commitment to AA and its tenets of sobriety to\nconclude he is no longer at risk of recurrence.  Without a favorable prognosis, it would\nbe imprudent to relax the time mitigation requirements of any of the mitigating\nconditions of the alcohol and criminal conduct guidelines.\nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant fails to make a convincing showing\nthat he has both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert any recurrent\nproblems with judgment lapses related to alcohol.  Safe predictions that he is no longer\nat risk of judgment impairment associated with such conduct are not warranted in these\ncircumstances.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by the alcohol guidelines of the SOR\nDrug issues\nAs he acknowledges, Applicant used illegal substances (marijuana and cocaine)\nregularly for over 10 years between 1977 and 1988.  In 1986, he was diagnosed by a\ncertified physician with poly pharmacy abuse.  And with a positive random drug test for\ncocaine still so recent (August 2004), it is difficult to credit Applicant with any sustained\nperiod of abstinence.   \nApplicant's recurrent use of cocaine (a drug he used quite regularly in the past) is\nsufficient to invoke four of the disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for\ndrugs, i.e., DC 25(a) \u201cany drug abuse\u201d), DC 25(b) (\u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use,\u201d\nDC 25(c) \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\n\n8\npurchase, sale or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d and DC 25(d)\n\u201cdiagnosis of a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist,\nor psychiatrist.\u201d  Although Applicant was credited with successfully completing his CU\ninpatient program in 1986, he soon returned to illegal drugs (marijuana and cocaine).\nAs a result, DC 25(f) \u201cfailure to successfully complete a drug treatment program\nprescribed by a duly qualified medical professional\u201d) has some continuing applicability\nas well, especially in light of his more recent positive drug test.. \nApplicant assures he has not used any illegal substances since his positive drug\ntest in August 2004.  To be sure, misconduct predictions (to include return to illegal drug\nuse), generally, may not be based on speculation or suspicion.  See ISCR Case No. 01-\n26893 (Appeal Bd. October 2002); ISCR Case No. 97-0356 (App. Bd. April1998).  The\nAppeal Board has consistently held that an unfavorable credibility determination\nconcerning an applicant is not a substitute for record evidence that the applicant used\nillegal drugs since his last recorded use, or based on his past use he is likely to resume\ndrug usage in the future.  See ISCR Case No. 02-08032 (Appeal Bd. May 2004). \nBased on Applicant\u2019s long history of sustained marijuana and cocaine use, his\npoly-pharmacy abuse diagnosis, his recent positive drug test, his past minimizing of the\nextent of his use in his statements to Government investigators, and his return to illegal\nsubstances following his 1986 inpatient treatment discharge, it is simply too soon to\nenable him to claim the benefits of any of the mitigating conditions of the guideline for\ndrug involvement. \nApplicant\u2019s assurances that his drug use is a thing of the past must be balanced\nagainst his considerable history of recurrent use (at times quite heavy), his positive drug\ntest with his current employer, his poly-pharmacy diagnosis, his understatements when\nasked about his drug use, and the relatively short amount of time that has elapsed since\nhis failed drug test.  Considering all of the developed evidence of record, Applicant fails\nto mitigate security concerns associated with his recurrent use and possession of illegal\nsubstances.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 2.a\nthrough 2.d of Guideline H. \nFalsification concerns\nPotentially serious and difficult  to reconcile with the trust and reliability\nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s misstatements and omissions he made in the series of interviews he\nparticipated in with DSS and OPM agents between August 1990 and April 1997.  So\nmuch trust is imposed on persons cleared to see classified information that deviation\ntolerances for candor lapses are gauged very narrowly. \nApplicant\u2019s misstatements and omissions about his alcohol and drug use in the\nsigned, sworn statements he signed for DSS and OPM are admitted and probative of\nhis withholding of adverse information about his alcohol and drug use.  His omissions\nare neither isolated nor explained and mask far more serious alcohol and drug use than\n\n9\nhe was willing to acknowledge in his earlier interviews. Considering all of the\ncircumstances of his noted misstatements, they cannot be excused as inadvertent.\nThey reflect a pattern of misstatements and omissions of material information about his\nrecurrent alcohol and drug use that was material to an investigation of security eligibility,\nand both knowing and wilful under all of the circumstances considered.\nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with, since he failed to accurately describe\nthe extent of his alcohol and illegal drug use following his 1986 discharge from inpatient\ntreatment.  In the past, the Appeal Board has denied applicants availability of the\npredecessor mitigating condition of MC 17(a) (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith\nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with\nthe facts\u201d) where the applicant has waited many months to timely correct a known\nomission. Compare ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (Appeal Bd. January 1998) with DISCR\nCase No. 93-1390 (Appeal Bd. January 1995).  Not until interviewed by an OPM agent\nin June 2006 (almost 10 years since his last DSS interview in April 1997) did Applicant\nvoluntarily come forward with a full and complete history of his illegal substance and\nalcohol use.\nBy minimizing his past involvement with illegal substances in his SF-86, Applicant\nconcealed materially important background information needed for the government to\nproperly process and evaluate his security updates.  His lack of plausible reasons for\nunderstating his drug and alcohol use are not sustainable grounds for averting\ninferences of falsification.  Weighing all of the circumstances surrounding his substance\nunderstatements/omissions and lack of any prompt, good faith corrections, Applicant\u2019s\nclaims lack the necessary probative showing to avert drawn conclusions that he\nknowingly and deliberately withheld material background information about his prior use\nof illegal substances and alcohol.\nFrom a whole person standpoint, Applicant is highly regarded by his supervisors\nand co-workers as reliable and dependable.  His overall reputation for reliability and\ndependability in the work place is not enough, however, to overcome repetitive\nmisstatements and omissions about his drug and alcohol use in his background\ninvestigations.\nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available\nguidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to added sub-paragraphs 3.a through 3.d  of Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, and conditions and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\n\n10\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.c\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE H (DRUGS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras 3.a through 3.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

On June 29, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn December 10, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s determination\nthat the Government had not made a prima facie case under Guideline B is erroneous; whether the\nJudge\u2019s application of the Guideline B mitigating conditions is erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s\nwhole-person analysis was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding error, we reverse.\n Whether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nApplicant was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in 1958.  She came to the U.S.\nin the late 1980s, completing her education.  She became a U.S. citizen in 2001.  Her husband is a\ncitizen of the PRC.  He has postponed becoming a naturalized citizen because of his elderly father,\nwho lives in China.  \u201cIt is easier and faster for her husband to go to China, if his father suddenly\nbecame ill, if he was still able to use a Chinese passport.\u201d  Decision at 2.  \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens of the PRC but permanent residents of the U.S.  They moved\nto the U.S. prior to the hearing in Applicant\u2019s case.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nIn deciding the case in Applicant\u2019s favor, the Judge considered the application of Foreign\nInfluence Disqualifying Condition (FIDC) 7(a).   This provision of Directive describes security\n1\n\nGovernment Brief at 8.  See also Administrative Notice Document (AN) IV, Intelligence threat Handbook, June\n2\n2004, at 17.  \nON II, Country Report on Human Rights Practices, March 2007, at 9.  \n3\nSee Directive \u00b6 6, describing the Foreign Influence security concern.  \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be\n4\na security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of\nthe foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information\nand/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.7(d).  \n5\n4\nconcerns rasied when an applicant\u2019s contact with, inter alia, a foreign relative \u201ccreates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion . . .\u201d  The Judge stated\nthat Applicant\u2019s ties to the U.S. are such that \u201cno \u2018heightened risk\u2019 has been shown that she would\never act improperly in a national security context. (Guideline B: Foreign Influence at 7.(a).\u201d\nDecision at 6.  In so doing, he apparently concluded that this disqualifying condition was not raised\non the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  Department Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s decision on this\nmatter fails to take into account significant record evidence.  That argument is persuasive.\nDepartment Counsel notes, for example, that the PRC is active in the collection of intelligence and\nsensitive proprietary information from U.S. defense contractors and that the PRC considers U.S.\ncitizens of Chinese ancestry to be \u201cprime intelligence targets.\u201d   The Board also notes other record\n2\nevidence that the PRC monitors its citizens\u2019 telephone, fax, and e-mail communications and\nroutinely enters residences to obtain such data.   These matters, read in conjunction with Applicant\n3\nhaving family members who live in the PRC, are sufficient to constitute substantial evidence of the\nsecurity risk outlined in the Directive.  Given the PRC\u2019s interest in U.S. intelligence, Applicant\u2019s\nforeign relatives pose a real, rather than merely theoretical, risk that Applicant could be targeted for\nmanipulation or induced into compromising classified information.        \n4\nDepartment Counsel also argues that the Judge erred in not considering FIDC 7(d),  which\n5\nidentifies security concerns arising when an applicant shares \u201cliving quarters with a person or\npersons . . . if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion . . .\u201d  Again, Department Counsel\u2019s argument is persuasive.  Applicant lives\nwith her husband, a citizen of the PRC, who in turn maintains contact with his father, a citizen and\nresident of the PRC.  Read in light of the above-referenced record evidence concerning the PRC\u2019s\nintelligence gathering activity, and the Judge\u2019s findings on the same issue, the record contains\nsubstantial evidence of the sort of foreign influence security concern described in FIDC 7(d).  Even\nif one interprets FIDC 7(a) and (d) narrowly, one must acknowledge that the Directive does not\nprovide an exhaustive and exclusive list of disqualifying circumstances; rather, the matters listed in\nthe disqualifying conditions are illustrative in nature and do not provide a Judge with a basis to\nconclude that factors or categories not explicitly described fall outside the general security concern\nof the guideline.  In analyzing cases before them, Judges must be guided by common sense and with\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.8(b).  \n6\n5\na view toward making a reasoned determination consistent with the interests of national security.\nThe Judge\u2019s conclusion that the Government has not presented substantial evidence of Guideline B\nsecurity concerns is erroneous. \nThe Judge did reference Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FIMC) 8(b)  and the whole-\n6\nperson, raising the implication that, despite his having found no security concerns in Applicant\u2019s\ncase, he evaluated Applicant\u2019s mitigation evidence  in the alternative.  The Board has examined the\nJudge\u2019s relatively brief mention of these matters in light of the record as a whole.  The Board\nconcludes that the record does not support the view that Applicant has met her burden of persuasion\nthat it is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security\u201d for her to have a clearance.\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 528.  The fact that Applicant lives with a PRC citizen, her husband; that her\nhusband maintains contact with his own father who is a citizen and resident of the PRC; that\nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of the PRC; that Applicant speaks with her brother over\nthe telephone \u201cseveral times a year;\u201d that the PRC targets U.S. citizens of PRC ancestry for\nintelligence gathering purposes; and that the PRC monitors telephone and other communications of\nits citizens constitute significant record evidence of security significant foreign contacts and interest.\nAs such, Applicant\u2019s evidence as to her good job performance and her ties to the U.S. are not\nsufficient to mitigate those concerns.  It is not to question Applicant\u2019s patriotism to acknowledge that\nthe record in her case raises the reasonable concern that she could be placed in a position of having\nto choose between her ties to the U.S. and her obligations to her foreign family members.  The\nevidence which Applicant has provided is not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board holds that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable on this record.\nOrder\n      \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jean E.

SAX\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRobert Bohn, Esquire, McKenna Long & Aldrich\nSYNOPSIS\nThis 49- year-old software engineer was born in China in 1958, and came to the U.S. 20 years\nago with her husband and baby.  She completed her education, raised a family and became a part of\nAmerican society.  The only allegations in the Statement of Reasons pertain to her having family\nmembers in China. Recently, her mother and father have emigrated to the U.S.  Her connections with\nChina are minimal compared with her ties to the U.S.  She understands her security responsibilities\nand she avers prompt reporting of any improper contacts.  Her history in the U.S. indicates her\nwillingness and ability to meet these responsibilities. Mitigation has been established. Clearance is\ngranted. \n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nOn June 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant. The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. \nOn July 30, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected\nto have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing. The matter was assigned\nto me on September 12, 2007. On October 9, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued setting the\nhearing for November 7, 2007. At the hearing the Government introduced two (2) exhibits\n(Government\u2019s Exhibit (GX) 1 - 2). At the hearing, the Government also offered six (6) Official\nNotice Documents (ON) 1 - 6. The Applicant testified and introduced twenty-four (24) exhibits\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A - X. All exhibits and Official Notice documents were admitted. The\ntranscript (Tr) was received at DOHA on November 20, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant is a 49-year-old computer engineer linguist/translator for a defense contractor. The\nSOR contains nine (9) allegations under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Applicant answered all\nallegations, most with comments and explanations. All specific admissions are accepted and\nincorporated herein as Findings of Fact.\nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following FINDINGS OF FACT\nas to the present status of each SOR allegation. \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n1.a. Applicant\u2019s husband is a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China (China).  He resides\nwith Applicant in the U.S. He came to the U.S. in 1988 to pursue his post graduate degree. Applicant\ncame the next year with their baby son. They both graduated with Engineering degrees from the same\nuniversity. They both became Permanent Residents in 1992. Her husband began the naturalization\nprocess, but he postponed completing the process because of his elderly and very ill 77-year-old\nfather in China, who is too frail to travel to the U.S. It is easier and faster for her husband to go to\nChina, if his father suddenly became ill, if he was still able to use a Chinese passport. American\ncitizens must obtain a visa (Tr at 43-46). \nHe is a legal Permanent Resident and intends to apply for U.S. citizenship when the need for\nquick travel no longer exists. He has visited China only three times since first coming to the U.S. in\n1988. This includes one business trip for his company. He is very active in community affairs in his\nhome area (AX U), as are their children (AX V and AX W). \n\n3\n1.b. - Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of China and a resident of the U.S. She retired from\nteaching school about 15 years ago. She and her husband applied to emigrate to the U.S. in 2003.\nThey were approved and  moved to the U.S. prior to the hearing (Response to SOR, Attachment 3).\n1.c. - Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen of China and a resident of the U.S. He retired about 15\nyears ago. He and his wife applied to emigrate to the U.S. in 2003. They were quickly approved and\nmoved here shortly before the hearing (Id.). \n1.d. Applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of China. He used to be a teacher, but for\nthe last 10 years has been self employed as a free lance screen writer and artist. They speak only a\nfew times a year. \n1.e. and 1.f. - Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of\nChina. She is 73, and lives on a pension. Her primary task is to take care of her elderly and ailing\nhusband, who is 77. Applicant has no personal contact with her in-laws. Her husband has visited his\nparents in China only a few times in the last 20 years (Tr at 83). \n1.g. - Applicant had telephonic contact with her parents once or twice a month. She visited\nher parents, when she traveled to China. However, both parents now reside in the U.S. \n1.h. - Applicant has telephonic contact with her brother several times a year. They talk about\nfamily matters and do not discuss the nature of her employment. \n1.i. - Applicant had only limited contact with her in-laws when she visited China. \n1.j. - Applicant was employed fora short time by an Institute of Meteorology and\nMeasurements as an Engineer from 1987 to 1989. This was almost 20 years ago and was right after\nshe graduated from school. She helped make industrial thermometers. This was at a time when the\ngovernment owned almost all industries and businesses. \n1.k. - Applicant traveled to China in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, and August 2006. With\nher parents now in the U.S., she no longer has any need to travel to China (Tr at 54).\nApplicant was born in China in 1958.  She came to the U.S. in the late 1980s, with her oldest\nson, who was naturalized in 2002. She completed her education, began her career, and has two sons,\n19 and 14, the youngest of which was born in the U.S. The 19-year-old is now in college here. Their\nhome is worth about $1.1 million (AX Q), her salary is about $107,00 per year, she has about\n$112,000 in a Company Savings Plan, her husband has about $522,000 in his Company Stock Plan\n(AX O), and the two of them have about $225,00 in an IRA (AX S). Applicant and her husband left\nany assets they had in China when they left more than two decades ago (Tr at 47). \nShe has received numerous letters of praise and recommendation from work supervisors and\ncolleagues (Response to SOR, Attachments 1 and 2; AX A, from a man who has held a DoD Secret\nsecurity clearance for 20 years; AX B, AX C, AX J, and AX W and Tr at 38-42); Certificates of\nRecognition of Exceptional Performance (Attachments 4, 5, 7, and 9), and positive work evaluations\n(Attachment 6) \n\n4\nEven though she has not yet received a security clearance, she has received company-wide\ntraining, program, and manuals, on the protection of company sensitive information and material (Tr\nat 37, 38). She always follows procedures (Id.). She strongly avers that if improperly contacted,\nregardless of source, she would immediately report the contact to Homeland Security and her\nCompany\u2019s Security Officer (Tr at 60, 61). She identifies most strongly with the United States and\nvery little with China (Tr at 64-66). Referring first to her children, \"It\u2019s their country, it\u2019s my country,\nit\u2019s our country. So they are going to be here forever. I will remain here for the rest of my life, with\nmy whole family\" (Tr at 66). \nPOLICIES\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant\nin all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (Directive, Enclosure 2 at Section 2, pages 18, 19). I have considered\nall nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion. \nEach of the eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive\n5220.6 identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate\nquestion of whether it is \"clearly consistent with the national interest\" for an individual to hold a\nsecurity clearance. An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the\nGovernment of having to prove those allegations. If specific allegations and/or information are\ndenied or otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving\nthose controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. \nOnce the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in\nthe Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue\na security clearance for the Applicant.\nThe person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government based upon trust and confidence. As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as\namended, at E2.2.2., \"any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\"\n\n5\nOfficial Notice Documents \nThe Government has introduced a number of Official Notice Documents pertaining to China.\nThe Official Notice documents discuss the official U.S. concern with China - that it a large and\nvibrant country of 1.3 billion people with an economy expanding at about 10% a year. China has an\nauthoritarian Communist government with a poor human rights record, the suppression of political\ndissent. China possesses large and sophisticated military forces, including nuclear weapons and\nmissiles. According to the Intelligence Threat Handbook, \"The United States is a primary\nintelligence target of China, because of the U.S. role as a global superpower, its substantial military,\npolitical, and economic power in the Pacific Rim and Asia.\" \nAnother official document states: China uses legal and illegal means, including espionage,\nto obtain such [military-related] technologies (ON VI). Over the past year, the United States has\nconvicted and sentenced a number of individuals for illegally exporting critical technology to China\n(Id.). The covers sheet to the Government submission of Official Notice Document abstracts\nconcerns from all six documents, all of which I give considerable weight.\nChina is clearly one of those countries deemed to be of the highest order of risk of seeking\nto violate U.S. security interests. Under DOHA Appeal Board precedent, it is clear that Applicant\nhas a particularly heavy burden of establishing she is not at risk of being subjected to pressure or\ncoercion \nCONCLUSIONS \nApplicant is a 49-year-old computer engineer. She was born in China in 1958 and emigrated\nto the U.S. in 1989, with her oldest son, a year after her husband had arrived here. She became a U.S.\ncitizen in 2001. Applicant has made herself a part of American society, albeit with Chinese roots.\nApplicant describes herself as follows: \nAfter all, I am a mom with two wonderful children growing up in this country. My\ncommitment, obligation, loyalties, and love [for] the U.S. precede any other interests. I, as\nparent, educate them to be a contributor and leader to the U.S. society. We have obligations,\nresponsibilities, rights, and privileges here. My older son and I vote. I also try to set a good\nexample for my children by being a role model. No foreign group, organization, or\ngovernment can influence me by any means to do anything that can negatively affect the\nbright future of my children. No one can choose their birth place, but my husband and I chose\nto live in this country and made the choice for our children for a better life. We were\nuprooted in China long ago and have established the foundation for our life with our children\nhere\" (Attachment to Response to SOR) \nIn summary, my foreign contact is so casual and infrequent that it will not create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation, or put me in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof any foreign group, organization, or government and the interests of the United States. There is no\n\n6\nconflict of interest because I don\u2019t have any obligations to any foreign person, group, government,\nor country. Just in case such conflict of interest emerges in the future, my longstanding relationships\nand loyalties [to] the United States will enable me to resolve it in favor of the U.S. interest\" (Id.). \nAs is the case with all Applicants who have reported family and relatives in foreign countries,\nApplicant faces the logically difficult, if not impossible, task of proving a negative; i.e., that\nsomething that has not happened in the past is at risk of happening in the future. What she can\nestablish is who she is and how she is likely to act in the future. \nIn the words of others who know her in a work context, Applicant is \"trustworthy, stands by\nher commitments, and has demonstrated a high level of performance and professionalism\n(Attachment 1 to Response to SOR). Similar comments are made by other colleagues as well (Id.,\nat Attachment 2.)  As to financial matters, Applicant has documented her financial ties to the U.S. -\nher current net worth as well in excess of $1 million (GX 2). \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if te individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or indeed to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interests. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is\nlocated, including but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known\nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nDisqualifying Condition - 7.(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion. \nMitigating Conditions - 8.(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country\nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; and 8.(b) there\nis no conflict of interest, either because of the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, organization, or country is so minimal or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict\nof interests in favor of the U.S. interest. \nAs established by Applicant\u2019s own words and conduct, and the highly favorable comments\nfrom others in positions of considerable security significance, she has (1) demonstrated an\nunequivocal preference for the United States, (2) renounced her Chinese citizenship upon becoming\nan American, (3) never renewed her now expired Chinese passport; and (4) has shown strong and\nlong lasting ties to the United States and its interests. I conclude that no \"heightened risk\" has been\nshown that she would ever act improperly in a national security context. (Guideline B: Foreign\nInfluence at 7.(a). To the contrary, even with her remaining ties to China, the record demonstrates\nthat she \"can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest (Id., at 8.(b)).\n\n7\nIn addition, the totality of the record, evaluated under the \"whole person\" concept, shows\nApplicant to be woman of strength and integrity, dedicated to her adopted homeland, and determined\nto protect the life she has made here for herself and her family. Overall, and considering her in the\nlight of the whole person concept, I conclude she currently possesses the judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness required of someone seeking a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are \nParagraph 1\nFore the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c. \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d. \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h. \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i. \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k. \nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nBARRY M.

Also alleged is that Applicant had a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case filed and discharged in 1991\u20131992. Applicant\u2019s Answer was mixed. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He served on active duty in the Army during 1986\u20131990. Since then, he has worked as a contractor at or near the same large Army post. He has worked as a video-teleconference (VTC) manager since 1994, and he has worked for his current employer since 2005. His gross annual salary is about $65,000. He is seeking to retain a security clearance. Applicant is married to his second wife. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1996, and he remarried in 1999. His wife is employed as a nurse for a local school district. She has a gross annual income of about $23,000. Applicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute. His history of financial problems is established by the 1991 Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, which was based primarily on unsecured credit card debt, and the more recent problems as revealed in credit reports from 2006 and 2008 (Exhibits 2 and 3).

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on April 29, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to an\nadministrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in this\ncase fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of financial\nproblems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nSeptember 9, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n See Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony for a narrative description of the debts and their status (Tr. 28\u201332).\n3\n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on June 12, 2008, and he requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on July 21, 2008. The hearing took place as scheduled on\nAugust 13, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 21, 2008.\nThe record was left open until August 27, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity\nto submit additional documentary evidence. He did so, and his three-page submission is\nadmitted as Exhibit G. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges ten delinquent debts for a total of about\n$21,000. Also alleged is that Applicant had a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case filed and\ndischarged in 1991\u20131992. Applicant\u2019s Answer was mixed. Based on the record\nevidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He served on active\nduty in the Army during 1986\u20131990. Since then, he has worked as a contractor at or\nnear the same large Army post. He has worked as a video-teleconference (VTC)\nmanager since 1994, and he has worked for his current employer since 2005. His gross\nannual salary is about $65,000. He is seeking to retain a security clearance. \nApplicant is married to his second wife. His first marriage ended in divorce in\n1996, and he remarried in 1999. His wife is employed as a nurse for a local school\ndistrict. She has a gross annual income of about $23,000. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute. His\nhistory of financial problems is established by the 1991 Chapter 7 bankruptcy case,\nwhich was based primarily on unsecured credit card debt, and the more recent\nproblems as revealed in credit reports from 2006 and 2008 (Exhibits 2 and 3). The ten\ndebts alleged in the SOR are summarized in the following table.3\n\n3\nDebts\nStatus\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013$67 collection account.\nSettled for $67 (Exhibit A).\nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013$482 medical account.\nSettled for $250 (Exhibit A). \nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013$207 collection account.\nSettled in full (Exhibits A and F).\nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013$5,200 unpaid government\ndebt.\nActual debt is $6,116; settled for $2,601\n(Exhibit A).\nSOR \u00b6 1.e\u2013$6,268 unpaid government\ndebt.\nSame debt as SOR \u00b6 1.d.\nSOR \u00b6 1.f\u2013$153 collection account.\nSettled for $76 (Exhibit A).\nSOR \u00b6 1.g\u2013$2,458 charged-off credit\ncard account.\nSettled for $1,500 (Exhibits A and D).\nSOR \u00b6 1.h\u2013$5,383 charged-off credit\ncard account.\nSettled for $2,933 (Exhibits A and E).\nSOR \u00b6 1.i\u2013$356 charged-off account.\nIntends to settle for $231 in Sep. 2008\n(Exhibit A).\nSOR \u00b6 1.j\u2013$800 charged-off credit card\naccount.\nDisputes; account has zero balance and\nunable to find any information on debt.\nHas current credit card with same\ncreditor (Exhibits A and C).\nIn addition to the debts in the SOR, Applicant has another $236 collection\naccount that he intends to resolve later this year (Exhibits C and G at 1).\nApplicant attributes the Chapter 7 bankruptcy to financial irresponsibility. Both he\nand his first wife had a habit of \u201cspend and go\u201d (Tr. 45).\nHe attributes his most recent financial problems to his use of alcohol. He says\n90% of his financial problems were due to his excessive alcohol consumption and 10%\nwas due to procrastination (Tr. 54\u201355). He has abstained from alcohol since June 2007\n(Tr. 50\u201354). In doing so, Applicant obtained treatment for depression, and he  explained\nthe benefits of abstaining from alcohol as follows:\nI will tell you that not in 52 years have I experienced such a joy,\nsatisfaction in life, in my marriage, with my grandchildren, my daughter. It\nhas absolutely been a turnaround, turning point in my life, sir. I can\u2019t\nexplain how broad of a spectrum it has improved my quality in terms of my\nhealth, how I feel just on a day-to-day basis. I still take an antidepressant\nevery day (Tr. 52).  \n\n Department of Navy v.

In late May 2008, he borrowed $9,500 (interest free)\nand agreed to pay it off with 21 monthly payments of $450 and one payment of $50\n(Exhibit G at 3). He made his first two $450 monthly payments in July and August 2008. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n6\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n7\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n5\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n15\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n16\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n17\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n18\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. In addition, another\n\n DC 6 is \u201cfinancial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling problems, or other issues\n19\nof security concern.\u201d\n6\ndisqualifying condition is raised because his recent financial problems are linked to\nexcessive consumption of alcohol.   \n19\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered, and MC 1, MC 3, and MC 4 apply\nin Applicant\u2019s favor. \nMC 1 applies for two reasons. First, it applies to Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7\nbankruptcy case because it happened during Applicant\u2019s first marriage, which\nsubsequently ended in divorce. The circumstances of that marriage, which contributed\nto the bankruptcy, are unlikely to recur. Second, it applies to Applicant\u2019s most recent\nfinancial problems because those problems are linked to excessive drinking. He has\nabstained from alcohol for more than one year, and he is enjoying the benefits of\nsobriety. Given these circumstances, additional financial problems linked to excessive\ndrinking are unlikely to recur.\n\n7\nMC 3 applies under a similar rationale as MC 1. It applies because the chief\ncause of his financial problems\u2014excessive drinking\u2014is a thing of the past as he has\nabstained from alcohol since June 2007. It appears Applicant has made a genuine\ncommitment to sobriety. Given these circumstances, there are clear indications that his\nexcessive drinking is resolved and under control.  \nMC 4 applies based on Applicant\u2019s well-documented efforts to resolve the\ndelinquent debts as revealed in the table above. He did so with the benefit of a family\nloan, but he signed a promissory note and has already made his first two monthly\npayments. Taken together, these circumstances qualify as initiating a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain\na favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept\nwas given due consideration and that analysis supports a favorable decision. This case\nis decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.l:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJohn Bayard Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He made a good-faith effort to resolve his\nfinancial problems by refinancing his home and paying or settling about $30,000 in debt. He\npresented sufficient information to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern. Eligibility\nfor a security clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on May\n11, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual basis\nfor the action and alleges a security concern under Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR\nalleges eight delinquent accounts for about $33,000 in total. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn May 31, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned for hearing on June 27, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled on August 8, 2007, and\nthe transcript was received on August 20, 2007.\nThe record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. On\nAugust 22 , Applicant made a timely submission and those matters (a fax cover sheet plus eight\nnd\none-page documents) were forwarded to me by department counsel who voiced no objections. The\nmatters are marked and admitted as Exhibit E.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all indebtedness in his reply to the SOR. He indicated that he was in the\nprocess of refinancing his home to obtain the necessary funds to resolve the debts and hoped to do\n\n3\nso by June 30, 2007. In addition to his admissions and explanation, the following facts are\nestablished. \nApplicant is a 56-year-old training analyst and property manager working for a contractor that\nprovides services to the U.S. Army. He has worked for his current employer since March 2004. He\nhas worked as a contractor for about the last 15 years. \nFrom 1968 to 1992, Applicant served on active duty in the Army working in signals\nintelligence. He rose through the enlisted ranks to the rank of sergeant first class. He was then\nadvanced to the position of warrant officer for his last four years of service when he retired as a chief\nwarrant officer two. \nHe has been married for nearly 36 years and has two adult children. His wife is not employed\noutside the home. She suffers from bipolar disorder and depression and work became too much for\nher. \nApplicant has held a security clearance for many years as a soldier and a civilian employee.\nHe is seeking to retain a security clearance for his current employment. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. Indeed, a credit report from 2001 reflects seven\naccounts in a collection or charged-off status (Exhibit 5). The SOR alleges that Applicant has eight\nunpaid debts ranging from $40 to $14,143 for a total of approximately $33,000. The indebtedness\nis based on collection accounts (two) and charged-off accounts (six). Seven of the eight debts appear\nto have originated from credit card accounts. \nApplicant has paid in full or settled all the debts alleged in the SOR (Exhibits A, B, C, D, E,\nand Applicant\u2019s testimony). He was able to do so by refinancing his home in June 2007. His home\nhad a market value of about $220,000 and he owed about $87,000 (between a mortgage loan and a\nline of credit). He refinanced for about $135,000, and he received about $36,000 after payment of\nclosing costs, fees, and one of the delinquent debts. His checking account statement reflects a deposit\nof $35,828.81 on June 29, 2007 (Exhibit B at 1). Applicant then used the money to pay or settle the\nother debts. \nIn total, he spent approximately $30,000 to pay or settle the eight debts. As of August 3,\n2007, his checking account had a balance of $8,850. His monthly mortgage payment is now about\n$100 less than he was previously paying on the mortgage and line of credit. Based on his retirement\npay from the Army, and his current income and expenses, Applicant and his wife have a positive\nmonthly cash flow and they are living within their means. He has about $16,000 in a 401(k)\nretirement account, which is the extent of his financial assets other than his home. \nApplicant attributes the debts to bad management by him and his wife. Also, he believes a\nformer son-in-law may have run up some of the credit card accounts, but does not have solid proof.\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n4\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n15\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n16\n MC 4 is \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n17\n5\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n14\nsignificant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet\nfinancial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHis history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline\n15\n16\nF. The record evidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. \nApplicant receives credit in mitigation. The most pertinent mitigating condition is the fourth\nMC  of Guideline F, because Applicant has made a good-faith effort to repay or settle the eight\n17\ndebts. His good-faith effort is established by his actions. In 2007, he refinanced his most valuable\nasset and spent about $30,000 in home equity to pay or settle the debts. And unlike many applicants\nin financial cases, Applicant has corroborated his testimony by providing documentary proof of\npayment or settlement of the debts. He has cleaned up his financial house, has cash left over, and is\notherwise living within his means. Although he can be faulted for taking too long to address his\nindebtedness, there are no concerns about his current financial situation.

He resigned in March 2004, rather than face an internal investigation he knew would likely\nresult in a recommendation he be fired. In December 2004, he deliberately falsified a security\nclearance application by failing to disclose he had left his previous job under unfavorable\ncircumstances. He did not mitigate the resulting security concerns about his personal conduct, sexual\nbehavior, and misuse of information technology systems. Clearance is denied.\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n Applicant specifically waived his right to 15-days\u2019 notice before hearing as provided by Section E3.1.8 of the\n2\nDirective.\n Those documents are described at Tr., 22 - 24. I excluded Gx. 3, an excerpt from DoD Regulation 5500.7-R\n3\n(the Department of Defense Joint Ethics Regulation), for reasons stated in the transcript of hearing at pp. 24 - 30. I\nadvised the parties, based on Department Counsel\u2019s request that I take notice of whether this regulation applies to the\nagencies within the Department of Interior, that I would research this issue (Tr., 63 - 64). Having reviewed that\ndocument, I conclude it applies only to agencies within the Department of Defense. Therefore, it is irrelevant to the\nallegations of misuse of IT systems at non-DoD agencies.\n Described at Tr., 9 - 11. Department Counsel did not object to including them in the record. \n4\n Tr., 35.\n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nAfter reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance.\n1\nOn May 10, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise\nsecurity concerns addressed through Guideline D (sexual behavior), Guideline E (personal conduct),\nand Guideline M (misuse of information technology systems).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, admitted with explanation all of the allegations\ntherein, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on June 29, 2007, and I convened a\nhearing on July 16, 2007, at which the parties appeared as scheduled.  I admitted two of the three\n2\nexhibits proffered by the government (Gx. 1- 3).  Applicant testified in his own behalf, but offered\n3\nno exhibits other than those included with his responsive pleading.  DOHA received the transcript\n4\n(Tr.) on July 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are incorporated herein as facts. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is 53 years old, and has a Ph.D. in geophysics. Since March 2004, he has worked\nin Maryland for a contractor supporting the National Air and Space Administration (NASA). He is\non a technical staff that performs planetary science research through interpretation of data received\nfrom spacecraft. He is an accomplished member of his profession, receiving over the years numerous\nawards, certifications, and letters of thanks and congratulations. He also serves on several\nprofessional boards, is widely published in his field, and has a record of working with sensitive\nclassified and unclassified information.5\n\n Answer to SOR; Tr., 41 - 42.\n6\n Tr., 61.\n7\n Gx. 2; Tr., 42 - 48, 53 - 55.\n8\n Gx. 1; Tr., 56 - 57.\n9\n Tr., 63 - 64.\n10\n Gx. 2; Tr., 49 - 50.\n11\n4\nFrom September 1984 until March 2003, Applicant was a federal employee working in\nArizona as a geologist for an agency within the Department of Interior. In October or November\n2003, Applicant was accused of using his government-issued desktop and laptop computers to visit\nweb sites containing sexually explicit materials. Applicant has admitted he did so and that he knew\nsuch use of government information technology (IT) assets was a violation of IT procedures where\nhe worked. Between 1998 and 2003, he misused his access to government computers as often as\ndaily, and at least several times each week, and he has acknowledged accessing over 4,000 web\npages of such material on the internet over the five years in question.  Applicant has not used\n6\ngovernment computers to access pornography on the web since 2003, but he still views it through\na personal laptop he uses when traveling for work.7\nWhen Applicant was confronted with his misconduct, he began looking for a new job. In\nNovember or December 2003, he interviewed with his current employer and verbally accepted a job\noffer. Applicant\u2019s supervisor and a personnel department representative investigating Applicant\u2019s\nconduct had already indicated to Applicant he probably would be fired over the matter. Applicant\ndid not want to suffer further embarrassment and decided to leave the agency to avoid a formal\ninvestigation into his actions. At his hearing, he acknowledged that his change of employment and\nthe allegations of misconduct were related.8\nIn December 2004, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) to begin a\nperiodic review of his clearance. In response to question 20, which asked if Applicant had, in the\npreceding seven years, been fired from or left a job under adverse conditions. He answered \u201cno.\u201d At\nsome point, Applicant initialed changes to the SF 86 indicating he had reviewed it for accuracy.  \n9\nApplicant\u2019s wife, some family members, and some of his former co-workers know about his\nreasons for leaving his previous job. When he was interviewed for his current job, he did not disclose\nthe real reason for wanting to leave his job in Arizona. He has only recently told his supervisor why\nhe may lose his clearance.  In June 2006, a government investigator interviewed Applicant as part\n10\nof his periodic reinvestigation. Applicant disclosed the circumstances surrounding his departure from\nhis previous employer when the investigator asked him about his answer to question 20.11\nApplicant has been receiving counseling for his behavior since late 2003. After leaving his\nprevious job in March 2004 and relocating to Maryland with his family, he resumed counseling in\nJuly 2004 with a new provider. Applicant attends counseling weekly or biweekly and, according to\n\n Attachment to Answer (Letter of May 31, 2007, from Margaret B. Hanagan, Psychiatric Clinical Nurse\n12\nSpecialist).\n Answer; Tr., 61 - 62.\n13\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President\n14\non December 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official\nrevision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are as follows: 1. Nature and seriousness\n15\nof the conduct and surrounding circumstances; 2. Frequency and recency of the conduct; 3. Age of the applicant; 4.\nMotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with\nknowledge of the consequences involved; 5. Absence or presence of rehabilitation; and 6. Probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n16\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n17\n5\nhis counselor, \u201chas shown clear and consistent progress in working on some very difficult issues.\u201d12\nNeither Applicant nor his counselor further explained what \u201cissues\u201d he is working on, but Applicant\nhas referred often to his conduct as \u201cthe problem.\u201d He testified he continues to view sexually explicit\nmaterials as a \u201cstress reliever.\u201d  \n13\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines  to be considered in evaluating an\n14\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance decisions must reflect\nconsideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue\napplicable to the facts and circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair,\nimpartial, and common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive.  The\n15\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion\nfor or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the\nparties at hearing require that Revised Adjudicative Guidelines D (sexual behavior), E (personal\nconduct), and M (misuse of technology) be applied.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified\n16\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, the burden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate\nthe government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a\nheavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n17\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n18\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 15.\n19\n \u201c[the] deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\n20\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance  eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities;\u201d\n \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\n21\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information;\u201d\n \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be\n22\nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a\nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment,  untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information. This includes but is not limited to consideration of:...(4) evidence of significant misuse of\nGovernment or other employer's time or resources;\u201d\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,\ntherefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.18\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonal Conduct. The government alleged Applicant should be disqualified from holding\na security clearance because he exhibited poor judgment by visited sexually explicit websites using\ngovernment-issued computers while he was a federal employee between 1998 and 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.a),\nand that he deliberately falsified his answer to SF 86 question 20 regarding adverse aspects of his\nemployment record (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The facts established raise, in turn, security concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s candor, trustworthiness, judgment and conduct. Specifically, \u201c[c]onduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during\nthe security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d19\nFurther, Guideline E disqualifying condition (DC) 16(a)  must be considered, because Applicant\n20\nadmitted he intentionally withheld from his December 2004 SF 86 the fact he left his previous job\nunder adverse circumstances. Applicant sought a new position when he did because he knew he\nwould be fired for his misuse of government IT systems to view sexually explicit materials on the\ninternet. All available information bearing on this issue shows Applicant is an intelligent, articulate\nperson who knew at the time he submitted the SF 86 his answer was false.\nGuideline E DC 16(c)  and DC 16(d)(4)  also apply to the information presented. As\n21\n22\ndiscussed under Guidelines D and M, below, over the course of several years, Applicant intentionally\n\n \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\n23\nbeing confronted with the facts;\u201d\n \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by\n24\nimproper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically\nconcerning the security clearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the\ninformation, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully;\u201d\n \u201c(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under\n25\nsuch unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; (d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change\nthe behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\u201d\n7\nviolated procedures governing use of IT systems in a government workplace. Such conduct also\nshows questionable judgement, in that he was aware through periodic memoranda and his own\ncommonsense as a well-educated scientist that such conduct was improper, yet he persisted in it on\na weekly, sometimes daily basis.\nHis response to the government\u2019s presentation does not support consideration of any of the\nGuideline E mitigating conditions (MC). As to his false answer to SF 86 question 20, MC 17(a)23\nmay not be applied, because Applicant made no effort to correct his answer during the 18 months\nthat elapsed from the time he submitted his SF 86 until his subject interview with a government\ninvestigator. Nor is MC 17(b)  applicable, because Applicant offered no information showing he\n24\nrelied on advice from anyone else about how he should answer the question.\nAs to the underlying misconduct, I have considered MC 17(c) and 17(d)  together. Neither\n25\nis available to Applicant, because, while nearly four years have passed since his misuse of\ngovernment IT systems cost him his job, the behavior was not infrequent. Further, in spite of\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledgment of his misconduct and poor judgment and his ongoing counseling,\nApplicant still accesses sexually materials on the internet for stress relief. Although he does not do\nso on a government computer, the motivation for his past misconduct is still present and undermines\nmy confidence the behavior will not recur. In light of all available information probative of this\nissue, I find he has not presented sufficient information to overcome the adverse information about\nhis personal conduct, and I conclude this guideline against the Applicant.\nUse of Information Technology Systems. The government further alleged as a basis for\nrevoking Applicant\u2019s security clearance, the actual conduct that led to his dismissal; that is, that he\nused government computers to view sexually explicit materials on adult web sites between 1998 and\n2003 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). As addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines at \u00b6 39, \u201c[n]oncompliance\nwith rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to information technology systems may\nraise security concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information. Information\nTechnology Systems include all related computer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for\nthe communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of information.\u201d\nThe government presented sufficient information at hearing to support the allegation, but did not cite\n\n As previously noted, Gx. 3 was excluded because it proffered evidence of a DoD regulation, which was not\n26\ncontrolling because the misconduct in question occurred when Applicant worked for a non-DoD agency.\n  \u201cunauthorized use of a government or other information technology system;\u201d\n27\n  \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances,\n28\nthat it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d\n8\nto any specific regulation, rule, or procedure Applicant may have violated.  Nonetheless, Applicant\n26\nadmitted the allegation, and information developed at hearing shows he was aware through periodic\nguidance from internal memoranda, through his own commonsense, and from his experience over\nseveral years as a federal employee that his conduct violated generally-known rules for use of\ngovernment computers and IT systems. \nOf the listed disqualifying conditions under this guideline, only DC 40 (e) applies.27\nApplicant\u2019s access to government IT systems (to surf the internet) may have been authorized, but\nthe way he used that access was not. In response to the government\u2019s information, Applicant did not\nprovide sufficient information to support application of any of the listed mitigating conditions under\nthis guideline. I specifically decline to consider MC 41(a),  for the same reasons I did not consider\n28\nMC 17(c) and 17(d) under Guideline E, above. Applicant\u2019s conduct in this regard continues to cast\ndoubt on his ability or willingness to comply with rules and procedures pertaining to government IT\nsystems, and I conclude this guideline against the Applicant.\nSexual Behavior. Lastly, the government alleged Applicant\u2019s clearance should not renewed\nbecause of his conduct in viewing sexually explicit materials on government computers between\n1998 and 2003 (SOR \u00b6 3.a). Again, the information submitted by the government, and Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions and testimony at hearing are sufficient to support this allegation. The facts established\nby that information raise a security concern addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines at \u00b6\n12; that is, \u201c[s]exual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional\ndisorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may subject the individual to undue\ninfluence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference concerning the\nstandards in the Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the\nindividual.\u201d \nAs discussed under Guideline E, above, Applicant\u2019s conduct reflects a lack of judgment,\nbecause he violated proscriptions against using government IT systems for improper purposes, and\nbecause he deliberately tried to conceal his conduct from the government when he re-applied for a\nclearance. Because he decided to resign rather than face further embarrassment at work through a\nformal investigation of his conduct, and he did not reveal to his new employer the real reason he\nchanged jobs, Applicant\u2019s conduct may still subject him to coercion, exploitation or duress. Finally,\nApplicant has responded to this allegation by characterizing his conduct as \u201cthe problem\u201d and\nproviding information about counseling he has been attending since late 2003. While his voluntary\nreferral to professional help is laudable, his testimony that he still visits adult web sites as a stress\nreliever indicates Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior has a  compulsive aspect that undermines any claim\nit is under control and responding to counseling.\n\n   \u201c(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that the person is unable to stop\n29\nor that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder; (c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; (d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of discretion or\njudgment.\u201d\n \u201c (1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\n30\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) The frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) The individual's age and maturity\nat the time of the conduct; (5) The extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) The presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) The motivation for the conduct; (8) The potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; (9) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n9\nUnder Guideline D, the foregoing requires consideration of DC 13(b), 13(c), and 13(d).  By\n29\ncontrast, for many of the same reasons discussed under Guideline E, none of the Guideline D\nmitigating conditions apply. Accordingly, I conclude this guideline against the Applicant.\nWhole Person. I have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines D, E, and M. I have also reviewed\nthe record before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in section 2(a) of the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  It is uncontroverted that Applicant is a well-educated professional, who\n30\nis eminently qualified and accomplished in his field. It is also clear his conduct, which occurred as\na mature adult, was, at least partially due to compulsion. It also was embarrassing to him, and he\ntried to conceal it from the government and a prospective employer. In light of the adverse effects\non his career and personal life, his continued viewing of sexually explicit materials perpetuates the\ngovernment\u2019s doubts about his judgment and discretion. Because such doubts must be resolved in\nfavor of the national security, a fair and commonsense assessment of all available information before\nme shows that the Applicant has not yet overcome the adverse information about his ability to\nprotect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected\nof one who holds a security clearance.\n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):         \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline M (Information Technology):  AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior):\n        AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the information presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.

Coale, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 27 June 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF.  Applicant submitted an undated answer received by DOHA 22 August 2007, and\n1\nrequested a decision without hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 24 June 2008.\nThe record in this case closed 18 May 2008, the day Applicant\u2019s response to the\ngovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) was due. Applicant did not respond to\nthe FORM.\n \nJuly 25, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations except for SOR 1.l., which she correctly\nasserted had been included in her September 2002 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge.\nThe record also established that the debt alleged at SOR 1.f. was discharged in\nbankruptcy. She is a 54-year-old driver employed by a defense contractor since August\n2006. She has not previously held a clearance.\nAs modified above, the SOR alleges, government exhibits substantiate, and\nApplicant admits, nine delinquent debts totaling over $21,000\u2014all of which became\ndelinquent after her chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in September 2002. Over $15,000\nof this new debt is for a state tax lien filed in February 2007. This lien has not been\naddressed. The remaining $5793 appears to have been paid between credit reports\ndated 23 April 2007 (Item 8) and 19 March 2008 (Item 9), only to be replaced by five\nmedical collection accounts totaling nearly $1,300 (Item 9).\nApplicant filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in June 2002, seeking relief\nfrom over $125,000 in liabilities. Those liabilities included $101,173 in unsecured priority\nclaims, of which $91,134 was owed to the IRS for unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest\nfor tax years 1990-1993. Those liabilities also included $23,135 in unsecured claims to\n22 creditors. Of those 22 creditors, 23 were readily identifiable with medical providers.\nApplicant reaffirmed one secured debt, for $1,000, for her television. In September\n2002, Applicant was discharged of her dischargeable debt, including\u2014by special\nagreement with the U.S. Attorney\u2014the $91,134 in back taxes owed to the IRS.\nDespite this fresh start, Applicant resumed having accounts referred to\ncollections as early as November 2002. In March 2007, DOHA inquired about 15 debts\nthat appeared on an October 2006 credit report (Item 7), some of which appear to be\nduplicate accounts. Three debts had been included in the bankruptcy, and at least one\npaid before the SOR was issued. Applicant attributed the IRS debt to their failure to get\ntax help when shuttering her husband\u2019s business in 1991-1993, and their medical debts\nto a previous employer\u2019s failure to pay their health insurance premium. However, the\nnamed employer does not appear on her clearance application (Item 5). Nevertheless,\nshe stated her intent to obtain credit counseling to address her outstanding debts (Item\n6).\nIt is not clear that the credit counseling ever occurred. Most of the debts that first\nappeared on Applicant\u2019s October 2006 credit report, remained on the three credit\nreports (one for each major credit reporting agency) she obtained for her April 2007\nresponse to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories. Most of them remained on the May 2007 credit\nreport obtained by the government just before issuing the SOR.\nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant re-stated her intent to obtain credit\ncounseling to address the debts she admitted. She also stated an intent to re-apply for\nher clearance in a year. The record contains no evidence that she obtained counseling,\nand although her March 2008 credit report suggests that the debts alleged in the SOR\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n3\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan\nto pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . .  \n3\nhave now been paid, there are new collection accounts. In addition, the March 2008\ncredit report covers only one of the major credit reporting agencies, which may not\nprovide full coverage of Applicant\u2019s debts.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has a lengthy history of\nfinancial difficulties, which is ongoing.  Although bankruptcy is a legitimate means of\n3\nobtaining relief from indebtedness and a new start at putting an individual\u2019s finances in\norder, the record contains insufficient information to conclude that Applicant was not\n\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n4\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.\u00a9 the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n,\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n4\nresponsible for the circumstances that ultimately caused her to seek bankruptcy\nprotection. Even with the new start, Applicant has been unable to gain complete control\nover her finances. Indeed, it is not clear that Applicant has any control over her\nfinances. More than half of her unsecured creditors in her bankruptcy were medical\nproviders. Two-thirds of the creditors alleged in the SOR were medical providers. The\nsix medical debts alleged in the SOR have been replaced by five more recent medical\nproviders. Except for the debt at SOR 1.b., none of the medical debts have been\nparticularly large, yet they have remained unpaid for significant periods of time.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  The debts were not due to\n4\ncircumstances beyond her control and she has not acted responsibly in addressing her\ndebts.  There is no evidence that she has sought credit counseling or otherwise brought\n5\nthe problem under control.  At best, eight of the nine debts have been recently paid,\n6\nand those were not paid in a timely, good-faith effort.  They were replaced by additional\n7\ndebt, and the state tax lien has not been addressed at all. Further, given her\nunwillingness to seek or use financial counseling, there is nothing in the record to\nsuggest that Applicant will put her financial problems behind her. I conclude Guideline F\nagainst Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s 20-year history of financial problems generates a financial considerations\nsecurity concern. These problems stemmed from layoffs, health crises, and other circumstances\nbeyond his control rather than from any financial irresponsibility. Most recently, Applicant has begun\nrehabilitating his finances by attending financial counseling, consolidating his debts into a payment\nplan, and obtaining a part-time job. Applicant has mitigated the security concern. Clearance is\ngranted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nExhibit M.\n1\nTr. 34.\n2\nExhibit DD, Letter from Ex-Employer, dated August 12, 1987.\n3\nExhibit W, Bankruptcy Record, dated July 15, 1987.\n4\nTr. 56.\n5\nExhibit X, Bankruptcy Record, dated February 10, 1988.\n6\n2\nOn July 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. He\nanswered the SOR on July 28, 2007, admitting all of the allegations, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on September 26, 2007. On October 1, 2007, DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing scheduling it for October 25, 2007. During the hearing, I received eight government\nexhibits, 19 Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received the transcript on\nNovember 2, 2007.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open for him to submit additional exhibits. Within\nthe time allotted, he submitted 24 additional exhibits that I incorporated into the record.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admissions are included in the findings of fact. In addition, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old married man with three adult children, two of whom are\nindependent. He continues to care for one son who is developmentally disabled. For the past 13\nyears, he has worked in the field of submarine maintenance as an electrical designer instructor. His\nemployer awarded him with a certificate of appreciation in August 2007.  He attended college in the\n1\n1970s, working toward a major in industrial technology, but did not graduate.  \n2\nOver the years, Applicant has struggled with job instability and family-related misfortune,\nbeginning in July 1987, when he was laid off.  Shortly thereafter, he grew unable to pay his debts,\n3\nand filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection.  He failed to adhere to the court-ordered payment\n4\nplan, leading to the dismissal of the petition in November 1987.5\nThree months later, in February 1988, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.6\nIn July 1988, approximately $65,000 of debt was discharged. His home was foreclosed through the\nbankruptcy.\n\nExhibit B, Resume, dated August 6, 2007.\n7\nTr. 59.\n8\nAnswer, at 3.\n9\nTr. 98.\n10\nAnswer at 3.\n11\nSummary of Trustee\u2019s Final Account, dated December 7, 1994, as included in Exhibit HH at 4. There is no\n12\nrecord evidence of how much debt Applicant was supposed to satisfy through the bankruptcy plan.\nExhibit 2 at 3.\n13\nTr. 61; Exhibit Z at 2.\n14\nExhibit 5, Court Order, dated May 20, 2002.\n15\nTr. 89.\n16\nTr. 90.\n17\nTr. 38.\n18\nExhibit QQ, Various Medical Invoices.\n19\n3\nIn April 1988, Applicant obtained another job.  In July 1988, he was laid off.\n7\n8\nIn December 1989, Applicant again filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection.   In 1990,\n9\nhe began making payments through the bankruptcy plan. By this time, he had gotten another job. In\napproximately 1992, he was again laid off.  Subsequently, he did not complete the payment plan,\n10\nand in 1994, the bankruptcy was dismissed.  He had satisfied $9,120 of debt through the plan at the\n11\ntime of its dismissal.  As a result of the bankruptcy dismissal, he lost his home to foreclosure.  \n12\n13\nApplicant\u2019s employment situation stabilized when he began working for his current employer\nin 1995. As his employment situation improved, his finances improved.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems recurred in May 2001 when he bought a home which,\nunbeknownst to him at the time of purchase, contained multiple defects, and required costly repairs.14\nAlso, his wife was laid off shortly after they purchased it. They were dependent on both incomes to\nmake ends meet.\nIn December 2001, Applicant began missing mortgage payments. In March 2002, he filed\nfor Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. It was dismissed two months later after he missed the deadline\nto file a bankruptcy payment plan.  Later that year, his home was foreclosed upon.\n15\n16\nIn December 2004, Applicant purchased another house.  By then, he and his wife had been\n17\nemployed without interruption for approximately a year. In December  2005, however, his wife was\nlaid off.  Also, her health began to deteriorate, requiring multiple surgeries and hospitalizations.\n18\n19\nShe has not worked since the 2005 layoff.\n\nTr. 40.\n20\nExhibit H.\n21\nExhibit I.\n22\nExhibit K.\n23\nExhibit 6.\n24\nTr. 70.\n25\nExhibit O.\n26\nExhibit N.\n27\nExhibit O.\n28\nTr. 49.\n29\n4\nBetween February 2005 and June 2006, Applicant\u2019s father, father-in-law, and uncle died. He\npaid $16,000 in burial and estate-closing expenses.  During this time, Applicant began to fall behind\n20\non his mortgage payments. In November 2006, he wrote the mortgagor detailing his misfortune, and\nrequesting to arrange a payment plan.  Receiving no response, he wrote again in January 2007.\n21\n22\nLater that month, he wrote $3,600 of checks, using money withdrawn from a retirement account, to\nthe mortgagor.  It did not accept them, and instead, initiated foreclosure proceedings.\n23\nIn March 2007, Applicant retained an attorney who contacted the mortgagor with another\nsettlement proposal.  The mortgagor rejected it, and continued with foreclosure proceedings. In\n24\nOctober 2007, the foreclosure process was completed, and Applicant lost his home.25\nCurrently, Applicant has approximately $8,800 of delinquent debt, including $1,775 in\nmedical bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d), $4,540 of credit card delinquencies (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.e, 1.g, and 1.i), and $2,900 in utility bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.f and 1.h). SOR\nsubparagraph 1.j lists $6,400 in debt owed to the mortgagor as of June 2007. This debt was satisfied\nafter the mortgagor resold his home after the foreclosure and applied part of the profit toward its\nsatisfaction.\nApplicant has been receiving financial counseling since April 2007.  In July 2007, with the\n26\nhelp of the counselor, he developed a payment plan and a budget.  Under the plan, he will make\n27\nmonthly payments of $350 to $375 per month for three years. He made the first payment in October\n2007.  \n28\nSOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.e, and 1.g through 1.i are included in the payment plan. Applicant\nis aware that he has some delinquent indebtedness stemming from his wife\u2019s extensive medical\ntreatment. He could not, however, identify the ones alleged SOR subparagraphs 1.b through 1.d. The\nSOR identifies the debts as medical accounts without specifying any creditors. Applicant satisfied\nSOR subparagraph 1.f.29\n\nExhibits S, Tr. 64.\n30\nTr. 93, Answer at 1.\n31\nExhibit A at 1-2.\n32\nExhibit S; Tr. 69.\n33\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n34\n5\nIn October 2007, Applicant obtained a part-time job.  He did so to offset a salary decrease\n30\nhe incurred when his primary employer eliminated overtime.  His net income from his primary\n31\nemployer is approximately $1,200 per month.  He will earn an additional $640 per month on his\n32\npart-time job.33\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n34\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\n\n6\n\u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\u201d In addition, individuals who are financially overextended, are \u201cat risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d Here, Applicant\u2019s recurrent financial problems\ntrigger the application of Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d FC DC 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d and FC DC 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other\nfinancial analysis.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by irresponsible spending or bad judgment.\nInstead, they were caused by repeated layoffs and family crises, including, among other things, his\nwife\u2019s serious illnesses, and the expenses associated with the death of three close family relatives\nin a 16-month span. Between 1995 and 2001, when these problems temporarily ebbed, Applicant\u2019s\nfinances were stable. \nApplicant\u2019s efforts at confronting his financial problems as they arose were not always\nsuccessful. However, he dealt with them each time in an organized and responsible manner.\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies.\nWithin the past seven months, Applicant has entered financial counseling, developed a\nbudget, and organized a payment plan. When his work-hours were reduced, he obtained a part-time\njob to offset the income loss. He has ample income to adhere to the payment plan. FC MC 20(c), \u201cthe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d and FC MC 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nAll of the remaining delinquencies except three medical bills listed in SOR subparagraphs\n1.b through 1.d are included in the payment plan. Although Applicant was unable to locate the\ncreditors, I conclude their existence does not create a security concern. In reaching this conclusion,\nI was particularly cognizant of the fact that the SOR referred to the delinquencies as \u201cmedical\naccounts\u201d without giving Applicant notice of the identity of any of the respective creditors. Upon\nweighing the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I conclude Applicant has mitigated\nthe financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nThe nature, extent, and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties is significant.\nSpecifically, he has filed for bankruptcy protection four times, and lost three homes to foreclosure\nin the past 20 years. These problems recurred frequently, and he has only recently been able to get\nthem under control. Conversely, all of his financial problems were caused by an extraordinary series\nof professional and personal misfortunes during the same time period. Between 1995 and 2001,\nwhen these problems subsided, he had no corresponding financial problems.\n\n7\nApplicant has methodically begun rehabilitating his finances by entering financial counseling,\npreparing a budget, and generating additional income through a part-time job. Similar efforts have\nnot always been successful in the past. I conclude, however, that the efforts at rehabilitation in\ntandem with the cause of the financial problems outweigh the risk of recurrence. Evaluating this case\nin the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concern.\nClearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.s:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nMarc E. Curry\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Tigerman, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 22, 2008,  DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 30, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance. Applicant  filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Finding no harmful error, we affirm.  \n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: in October 1990, Applicant\nappeared before a DOHA Administrative Judge in a security clearance hearing, addressing his prior\nuse of marijuana.  At the hearing, he was asked if he planned to use marijuana in the future.\nApplicant replied that he did not intend to do so.  He further stated, \u201cI believe it\u2019s in my best interest\nand the best interests of the Department of Defense that I do not, both because of my participation\nand role as a leader in my company.\u201d  Decision at 2.  However, Applicant subsequently used\nmarijuana on two occasions.  \u201cHe does not know why he used it on these occasions.\u201d  Id.    \nThe Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) Although Applicant has demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s\nfindings contain error, the Board concludes that such error is harmless.  See ISCR Case No. 06-\n23112 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 2007).   Applicant further contends that the Judge erred in her analysis\n2\nof the Guideline E security concerns.  Specifically Applicant persuasively argues that the Judge erred\nin concluding that Applicant\u2019s 1990 testimony concerning future marijuana use was a deliberate\nfalsification.  Additionally, Applicant correctly notes that certain language in the Judge\u2019s decision\n\nThe Judge\u2019s decision contains the following statement:  \u201cConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has\n3\nintroduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the government\u2019s case\nunder Guidelines H and E of the SOR.\u201d  Decision at 5.  The Board also notes Applicant\u2019s point that the Judge\u2019s formal\nfindings neglect to make explicit reference to subparagraphs 1(b) and (c) of the SOR.    \nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.15.\n4\n3\nis inconsistent with her ultimate adverse determination.   However, the sustainable findings of fact\n3\nin the Judge\u2019s decision support her adverse conclusion under Guideline E, in that they illustrate\n\u201cquestionable judgment\u201d and, therefore, impugn Applicant\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.   The\n4\nBoard concludes that there is insufficient reason to remand to the case to the Judge for a new\ndecision.  Therefore, the Board concludes that identified errors in the decision are harmless.\nAccordingly, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s decision is sustainable in light of the standard set\nforth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). (\u201cThe general standard is that\na clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national\nsecurity.\u2019\u201d) \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Michael Y.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Charles S. Tigerman, Attorney At Law\nOctober 30, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on June 23,\n2005.  On July 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 14, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on September 4, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on\nSeptember 12, 2008, scheduling the hearing for October 2, 2008.  The Government\noffered seven exhibits referred to as, Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant offered no exhibits but testified on his own behalf.\nThe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on October 16, 2008.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 70 years old and has a Bachelor\u2019s of Science in Mathematics\nand a Bachelor of Arts in Statistics.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an\nChief Engineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant has been working for the Department of Defense in some capacity\nfor almost fifty years.  He began using marijuana in 1970, and continued to use it until at\nleast 1989.  He understood at the time that its use was illegal.      \nOn October 25, 1990, the Applicant appeared before a DOHA Administrative\nJudge in a security clearance proceeding and discussed his marijuana use from 1970 to\nat least 1989.  At the hearing, the Applicant was asked whether he planned to use\nmarijuana in the future.  The Applicant stated that, I do not\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 6, p.\n25, lines 19 through 23).  He further stated that \u201cFor my use, I believe that I should not\nsmoke at all.  I believe it\u2019s in my best interest and the best interest of the Department of\nDefense that I do not, both because of my participation and role as a leader in my\ncompany.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 6, p. 38, line 22).  Despite the statement he made to\nthe  Department of Defense at the hearing, the Applicant subsequently used marijuana\non two occasions during the period from January 1999 through February 2002.\n(Government Exhibit 3).  He does not know why he use it on these occasions.  (Tr. p.\n55).  \nDuring the present hearing, the question was asked of the Applicant if he were\nretired and no longer needed a clearance, could he state that he would never use\nmarijuana in the future.  The Applicant could not say that he would never use it.  (Tr. p.\n58).\n           \nThe Applicant further stated that his wife suffers from a back condition and was\nprescribed marijuana by a NASA internal medicine physician.  She keeps marijuana in\ntheir home and uses it when her back is bothering her. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nher personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Government contends that the Applicant provided false information to the\nGovernment during his security clearance hearing on October 25, 1990, when he stated\nhe had no intentions of using marijuana again, when in fact he continued to use\nmarijuana on at least two more occasions during the period from January 1999 through\nFebruary 2002.  The Applicant contends that at the time he made the statement, he had\nno intentions of ever using marijuana again, and that at the time he made the statement\nhe was being truthful.  (Tr. pp. 23 -26).    \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s argument has no merit in this case.  The Government relied on the\nstatement of the Applicant, to be true and accurate, with the impression that the\nApplicant would not use marijuana in the future.  The Applicant broke his promise to the\nGovernment.     \n           \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n22.(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\n\n4\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges.\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse and dishonesty that demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H) and dishonesty (Guideline E).\nThe totality of this evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness\non the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's\nconduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines H and E of the SOR.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant used marijuana from 1970 until at least\nSeptember 1989.  It also shows that he represented to the Government during a\nhearing before DOHA in October 1990, that he did not intend to use marijuana again,\nleaving the government with the impression that he would never use it in the future.\nThe Applicant did not keep his work.  During the period from January 1999 to February\n2002, the Applicant used marijuana on at least two occasions.  Under Guideline H, Drug\nInvolvement, Disqualifying Conditions, 25(a) any drug abuse, 25(c) illegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or\ndistribution or possession of drug paraphernalia, and 22(g) any illegal drug use after\nbeing granted a security clearance apply.  However, Mitigating Condition 26.(a) the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment also applies.  Applicant\u2019s last use of\nmarijuana occurred in 2002, over six years ago.  His last use of illegal drugs occurred\nso far in the distant past and there is no evidence in the record to indicate otherwise.  I\ndo not find his past use of illegal drugs to be recent or of security significance.\nAccordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. \nOn the other hand, the Applicant misled the Government by stating that he would\nno longer use marijuana when in fact he did.  Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct,\ndisqualifying condition 16(a), deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\n\n6\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities applies. Applicant told the Administrative Judge that he had no\nintention of using marijuana again and then used it again.  He cannot be trusted.  I find\nthat he deliberately lied to the Government during the DOHA hearing in October 1990.\nConsequently, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 70 years old and cannot\nin all truthfulness say that he will not use marijuana in the future.  Under the particular\nfacts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed\nas a whole, support a whole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, a lack of candor, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nand/or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nclassified information.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is not trustworthy, and does meet the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against\nthe Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Guideline H (Drug Involvement is\nfound for the Applicant.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 2 of the SOR.  Paragraph 1 is found for the\nApplicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant has successfully mitigated financial \nconsiderations concerns. Clearance is granted. \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on August 15, 2007, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, for financial considerations based on a history of financial problems as \nevicenced by delinquent debts. \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n1\n January 29, 2008\n\n \n \nOn July 18, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. On October 16, 2007, I was assigned the case. On October 18, \n2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing for a hearing held on November 16, 2007. The \ngovernment offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A and B, which were \nadmitted into evidence. On November 28, 2007, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of \nthe hearing.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k, with explanations. The admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record, case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old industrial engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since September 1980, and is seeking to maintain a security clearance. \nSupervisors, coworkers, and friends indicate Applicant has a strong work ethic, a keen \nsense of teamwork, can be trusted to deliver results, is truthful, trustworthy, organized, \ndependable, dedicated, honest, selfless, he is willing to help others, and is active in the \ncommunity and church. (Ex. B) At work he meets or exceeds expectations. (Ex. B) \n \n \nIn November 1994, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. In March \n1995, the Discharge of Debtor entry was made and Applicant was released from all \ndischargeable debts. (Ex. A) During Applicant\u2019s first marriage his wife paid the bills. He \nassumed the debts were being paid until creditors began contacting him at work. The \ncreditors wanted to garnish his pay. At that time, Applicant contacted a debt reduction \nservice to help him with his financial problems. (Tr. 31) However, the creditors would not \nwork with him and wanted to garnish his pay. They were not agreeable to the amounts \npresented by the debt reduction service. (Tr. 53) Applicant attended budgeting classes \nand resorted to bankruptcy as a last resort. Since then, Applicant has also taken college \ncourse on budgeting. (Tr. 52) \n \n \nIn January 1998, Applicant applied for Chapter 13, wage earner\u2019s plan, \nprotection. His separation, divorce, attorney fees, and a child custody case left him with \nlittle money. He was required to pay support for his three children. His final decree, \nending his 22 year marriage, is dated January 2002. (Ex A, Attachment 1.B, Tr. 44, 50) \nHe wanted to continue paying his bills and have some financial protection at the same \ntime. (Ex. A) The Chapter 13 provided a monthly budget to allow him to pay his \ncreditors and meet his expenses. (Tr. 41) The plan lasted from 1989 through January \n2002. (Tr. 53) The plan was fully administered and Applicant received a final decree. \nThe Applicant had complied with the provisions of the confirmed plan and completed all \npayments to be made there under. (Ex. A) This was a period of financial stability in \nApplicant\u2019s life. (Tr. 42)  \n \n \n2\n\n \nIn June 2002, Applicant\u2019s oldest daughter graduated from high school. He had \nbeen paying $600 per month child support. Child support almost doubled increasing by \n$500 per month to $1,205. (Tr. 43) He attempted to pay his child support and meet his \nliving expenses. He obtained some payday loans to help him with his finances. His \ngross monthly income was $4,422 and his deductions including child support was \n$2,016. His monthly expenses were $2,318 and monthly payment on his bills was \n$1,957. (Ex. 2) Applicant was over extended and after discussing his finances with his \nattorney, decided to filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in October 2003. In \nJanuary 2004, Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged. (Ex. A) In June 2005, Applicant paid \nthe last child support. (Ex. B) Applicant never missed any of his child support payments. \n(Tr. 53)  \n \n \nFor tax years 2003 and 2004, Applicant owed the IRS $4,000. (SOR \u00b6 1. d) He \nhas an installment agreement paying the IRS $150 per month. (Tr. 54) The debt has \nbeen reduced to $2,149. (Ex. A, Attachments 2.A and 2.B, Tr. 39) Taxes were incurred \nwhen he was required to file as \u201cmarried filing a separate return.\u201d \n \nThe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1e - \u00b6 1. k were his children\u2019s medical bills of which \nhe was unaware. (Tr. 51) He maintained medical insurance for his children through his \ncompany. Applicant owed a $70 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e), which has been paid. (Ex. A, \nAttachment 3) Applicant owed a $457 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f), which was included in his \nOctober 2003 bankruptcy. The debt was discharged in January 2004. (Ex. A, \nAttachments 1. C and 4) Applicant owed a $125 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g), which has been paid. \n(Ex. A, Attachment 5) Applicant owed a $70 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e), which has been paid. \n(Ex. A, Attachment 3) Applicant owed a $208 debt (SOR \u00b6 1. h), which has been paid. \n(Ex. A, Attachment 6) Applicant owed an $83.95 debt (SOR \u00b6 1. k), which has been \npaid. (Ex. A, Attachment 8) The SOR did not have a subparagraph 1. i. \n \n \n \nApplicant has two companies to help him monitor and control his credit. His credit \nscore has improved from 543 in 2003 to 584 in 2007. (Ex. B) The fair market value of \nApplicant\u2019s home is $200,000 on which he owes $180,781. (Ex. B) Since 2003 his \nsalary has increased 46 percent. (Tr. 34) He was paying $14,000 a year in child support \nand now pays zero. Applicant\u2019s salary has increased from $57,496 in 2003 to $84,381 \nin 2007. Applicant has additional income as an umpire and does work as a printer. (Ex. \nA, Attachments 6 and 7, Tr. 36) \n \n \nApplicant remarried in 2003 and was divorced in 2006. (Tr. 50) Applicant \npresented letters from numerous creditors indicating his accounts are in good standing \nor have been paid in full. (Ex. B) Applicant included copies of his budgets (Ex. B), is \nliving within his means, and his credit score is improving. (Tr. 33)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n \n3\n\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F (financial considerations) a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \n \n4\n\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.2 \n \n \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an \nindividual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, \nnegligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. \nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how \na person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required \nto be debt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial \nobligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant has had to resort to bankruptcy protection three times and, at one \ntime, owed approximately $4,500 on eight past due obligations. Seven of Applicant\u2019s \ndebts were under $500 each. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d \napply.  \n \n \nOf concern is Applicant having had to resort to bankruptcy protection three times. \nIn 1994, Applicant\u2019s wife was handling the family\u2019s finances. He was unaware the bills \nwere not being paid. When Applicant learned of the problem, the creditors were not \nwilling to work with him or accept the proposed payment amounts presented by the debt \nreduction service. Applicant is no longer married to this woman and now maintains \ncontrol over his finances.  \n \n \nIn January 1998, Applicant\u2019s separation, divorce, attorney fees, and child support \nobligation left him with little money to pay his living expenses and other debts. When his \nchild support almost doubled to $1,200, he was unable to pay both his child support and \nliving expenses. He obtained some payday loans to help him with his finances, but had \nto resort to the forced budget plan in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. In 2004, he again filed \nfor bankruptcy protection when his child support payments added to his financial \nproblems. In June 2005, Applicant\u2019s child support obligation ended. His debts were \ndischarged in each of his Chapter 7 bankruptcies. In 2002, having complied with the \nprovisions of the plan, which had lasted four years, and had completed all payments \nunder the plan.  \n \n                                                          \n2 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n \n5\n\nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial problems \nwere contributed to by his child support obligations. He never missed making his child \nsupport payments, but was unable to pay his living expenses while meeting his support \nobligation. He no longer has a child support obligation. It is unlikely he will again incur \nfinancial problems due to making child support payments. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \n \nAG & 20(b), Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,@ applies. Applicant experience both \nseparation and divorce along with the financial burden associated with each.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nunder AG & 20(c), applies. Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ Applicant has paid seven of the eight debts and has an agreement paying the \nIRS $150 per month on the remaining debt. The total amount of unpaid debt is \napproximately $2,000. He has attended financial classes, maintains a budget, is living \nwithin his means, paying his debts, has received a substantial increase in salary, and no \nlonger has a $14,000 per year child support obligation. \n \nNeither the sole remaining $2,000 debt, which he is paying, nor his having to \nhave resorted to bankruptcy protection, raises concerns about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \n6\n\n \n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were not the \ntype that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations. Money was not spent frivolously. The set forth in the SOR were not \nincurred on luxuries, but were for medical treatment and taxes. \n \nSince the filing of his most current bankruptcy, Applicant has only one \noutstanding debt on which he makes monthly payments. This debt cannot be a source \nof improper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts \nare paid\u2014it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to \nhold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.k: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n      Mary Lou Taylor, Personal Representative \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application on January 17, 2006.  On \nNovember 8, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for Applicant under Guideline \nB, Foreign Influence, and Guideline C, Foreign Preference.  The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 15, 2007. She \nanswered the SOR in writing on December 17, 2007, admitting the factual allegations \nwith explanation except for the allegation that she is a dual citizen of both the United \nStates and Iran.  She denied the admitted facts created a security concern.  She \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department counsel was prepared \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nto proceed on January 31, 2008.  The case was assigned to another administrative \njudge on February 1, 2008, and reassigned to me on March 20, 2008.  DOHA had \nissued a notice of hearing on February 26, 2008, for a hearing on March 25, 2008.  I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on March 25, 2008.  The government offered five \nexhibits, marked government exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 5, which were received \nwithout objection.  Applicant submitted 11 exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) \nA through K, which were received without objection.  Applicant and nine other witnesses \ntestified on Applicant\u2019s behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nApril 2, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iran. (Tr. 23-26, Court Exhibit I)  The request and the attached \nsupporting documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record \nas Court Exhibits.  Applicant had no objection to the request for administrative notice or \nthe attached documents.  The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings \nof Fact, below.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.  Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR, except the allegation pertaining to dual citizenship with Iran and the United \nStates, with explanation. She also provided additional information to support her request \nfor eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant is 47 years old and an aerospace and systems engineer for a defense \ncontractor.  Applicant was born in Iran and received her elementary education in Iran.  \nShe received her high school education in Switzerland.  She then attended school in \nGreat Britain for one year before coming to the United States on a student visa in 1979.  \nShe received her bachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering from a United States \nuniversity in 1984.  She received a Master\u2019s degree in systems engineering from a \nUnited States university in 2000.  Applicant became a United States citizen in 1991. (Tr. \n91-93; Gov Ex 1, Security Clearance Application, e-QIP, dated January 17, 2006)   \n \nApplicant is presently single but has been married twice.  She married a United \nStates citizen in 1984 shortly after receiving her bachelor\u2019s degree.  Shortly after her \nmarriage, she applied for and received her permanent resident status in the United \nStates.  She was divorced in 1987.  She married another United States citizen in 1989, \nand that marriage was dissolved by divorce in 1997.  She has lived continuously in the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nUnited States since her arrival in 1979. (Tr. 93-97; Gov Ex 1, Security Clearance \nApplication, E-QIP, dated January 17, 2006)   \n \nApplicant has worked for her present defense contractor employer since 1999.  \nPrior to that, she worked for other defense contractors.  She applied for a security \nclearance in 1992 and it was granted in 1993.  She has continuously held a security \nclearance since it was first granted in 1993.  She has received periodic investigations \nand reviews since the initial grant of a security clearance.  She presently has a security \nclearance. (Tr. 39, 96-97) \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was a wealthy business man in Iran before the overthrow of the \nShah in 1979.  He was the owner and managing partner with his brothers of the \nAmerican car dealership in Iran.  At the time of the overthrow of the Shah, her father \nwas in France.  He never returned to Iran after the overthrow and lived in France until \nhe died in 1988.  Her father and mother divorced in 1980 but remained amicable.  There \nis no indication that her mother remarried.  Her father\u2019s business was confiscated and \nsold but he never received any proceeds from the sale of the dealership.  While he was \na business man, he did not have any arrangements or contacts with the Shah or the \ngovernment. (Tr. 98-101) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 78 years old and a resident and citizen of Iran.  She also is \na permanent resident (green card) of the United States.  Applicant visits her mother in \nIran frequently.  Applicant visited her mother in Iran in May and June 1997, October and \nNovember 2000, December 2003 to January 2004, and March 2005. Her last visit to \nIran was in early 2007 to see her mother.  Applicant and her mother are trying to \narrange their next visit at a neutral site since both she and her mother are concerned \nabout Applicant coming to Iran.  She and her mother agree it is too difficult and \ndangerous for Applicant to travel to Iran.  Applicant\u2019s mother also visited her in the \nUnited States.  She visited numerous times since 1996 and her last visit was in \nSeptember 2002.  Applicant\u2019s mother has not traveled to see her since 2002 because of \nthe physical difficulties in traveling, her advanced age, and her deteriorating health. (Tr. \n107-109, 117-121) \n \nApplicant also talks to her mother at least weekly by telephone.  She has tried to \nget her mother to move to the United States and live with her.  Applicant purchased a \nhouse so her mother could live with her.  Her mother did come to the United States for a \ntime and tried to live here.  However, the lifestyle was different and her mother did not \nlike it and returned to Iran.  Applicant considers her relationship with her mother as a \nclose mother-daughter relationship.  When her mother passes away, she will be buried \nin Iran.  Applicant fully intends to travel to Iran for her burial.  Her mother does not know \nshe has a security clearance, that she works for a defense contractor, or her type of \nwork.  Her mother knows only that she is an engineer for a good company. (Tr. 124-\n126, 138, 146-147) \n \nHer father owned property in Iran prior to the 1979 revolution.  He owned \ncondominiums in Tehran which he purchased in the name of Applicant and her brother \n\n \n4 \n \n \nwhen they were about six years old.  Her mother lives in one of the condominiums.  Her \nfather also owned two condominiums near the Caspian Sea which her mother still uses.  \nApplicant tried to turn over her rights to the condominium to her mother in 1994.  \nHowever, her mother was unable to make the transfer because of the legal and political \nsituation in Iran.  Applicant executed a power of attorney to her mother permitting her to \ndo anything with the properties that she thinks is appropriate. (Tr. 107-108)  Applicant \nand her brother inherited her father\u2019s house in France which they sold and split the \nproceeds. (Tr. 102-106) \n \nApplicant does not expect to receive any proceeds from the sale of the properties \nin Iran.  Applicant\u2019s father died without a will.  By Iranian law, her brother gets two-thirds \nof the estate and she gets one third.  She does not believe the properties will be sold \nbecause the family has been unable to sell them for many years.  She believes they will \nremain unused after her mother passes away.  Her father also owned undeveloped land \nin Tehran and Tabriz with his brothers.  Applicant is unsure of the ownership and value \nof the properties.  However, she has turned over her rights to the properties by power of \nattorney to her mother. (Tr. 110-112, 145-146) \n \nApplicant has a full brother and two half brothers through her mother.  Her full \nbrother is a citizen and resident of the United Kingdom but also has a United States \npermanent resident certificate.  One half-brother is a resident and citizen of the United \nKingdom.  Her other half brother is a citizen of France but resides in the United States \nas a permanent resident. (Tr. 112-113) \n \nApplicant has an uncle from her paternal side of the family that is a resident and \ncitizen of Iran.  Her father\u2019s other brothers are deceased. Applicant has an aunt from her \nmaternal side of the family that is also a resident and citizen of Iran.  She also has some \ncousins who are citizens and residents of Iran.  The last time she saw any of these \nrelatives was in early 2007 for the Persian New Year when she visited her aunt and \nuncle in Iran.  Her relationship with her aunt and uncle are cordial.  She has had no \ncontact with them since early 2007.  She also has two maternal aunts who are residents \nand citizens of the United States. (Tr. 114-116, 1124-126) \n \nApplicant has, in addition to her United States passport, a current Iranian \npassport.  She obtained her first United States passport in 1991 shortly after becoming \na citizen.  She renewed her original Iranian passport in 1993 or 1994 following the \nguidance from the United States State Department to travel to Iran on an Iranian \npassport and not a United States passport.  She last renewed her Iranian passport in \n2007.  She turned her Iranian passport to her employer\u2019s facility security officer. \n(Applicant Exhibit B, FSO Letter, dated February 26, 2008)  She is trying to make some \narrangement to use the Iranian passport if needed to travel to Iran to see her mother.  \nShe believes if she asks for the passport back to use for travel to Iran she will lose her \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 121-124) \n \nOn one of her trips to Iran in 1979, Applicant was questioned by Iranian \nauthorities at the airport.  The authorities knew she was a United States citizen and \n\n \n5 \n \n \nasked her to wait with other United States citizens of Iranian ancestry.  They copied her \nUnited States passport and let her enter the country.  She has not had any other \nincidents entering or leaving Iran.  Her mother is careful about Applicant coming to Iran.  \nShe will not let Applicant visit if the political situation is not right.  Applicant is mindful of \nall of the State Department travel warnings and follows them. (Tr. 129-137)  Applicant is \nnot aware of any procedure recognized by Iran to renounce Iranian citizenship.  Her \nIranian passport does have a stamp from Iran indicating that she is a United States \ncitizen.  She would renounce her Iranian citizenship if she could and if it would not \ncause harm to her mother.  She maintained an Iranian passport because of the State \nDepartment guidance that such a passport is needed to enter or exit Iran.  She felt that \nher possession of the passport was keeping with the State Department guidance. She \nhas no reason to visit Iran except to see her mother. (Tr. 139-142, See, Gov Exs 2 and \n3, Interrogatories, dated July 12, 2007, and August 16, 2007). \n \nApplicant presented a number of witnesses to testify to her reliability and \ntrustworthiness.  A long term friend who is an Army employee testified that she has \nknown Applicant for over 20 years and they have a close relationship.  She considers \nApplicant to be a loyal United States citizen who is proud of her citizenship.  When \nApplicant became a citizen, she had a party for her. (Tr. 43-47) \n \nA retired Navy officer testified he has known Applicant for over 10 years.  She is \na close friend of his family and they spend time together.  He considers her a loyal \nUnited States citizen who is dedicated and devoted to the United States.  He believes \nher trustworthiness and character are beyond reproach.  She is energized to be a \nUnited States citizen. (Tr. 47-53)  \n \nA senior supervisor for Applicant\u2019s employer testified he hired her in the early \n1990s and worked with her directly for a number of years.  They have also worked \ntogether on professional committees.  Her work performance was excellent and she \nwas a good conscientious employee.  Applicant was always professional and \ntrustworthy in her personal and professional dealings.  She always spoke highly of the \nUnited States.  He has held a security clearance for over 30 years and has \nrecommended others for access to classified information.  He would fully recommend \nApplicant for access to classified information.  In fact, he had recommended her for her \nfirst security clearance. (Tr. 53-58) \n \nA retired Navy officer and former ship commander testified who has worked as a \ncolleague with Applicant for over six years in support of Navy contracts.  He considers \nApplicant\u2019s work to be very professional and she cares about her work product in \nsupport of the Navy.  He considers Applicant caring and eager to work in support of the \nUnited States Navy.  He considers Applicant trustworthy, open, honest, and above-\nboard.  He discussed with Applicant her trips to Iran to see her mother and Applicant \nwas very open with her discussions. (Tr. 60-65) \n \nAnother retired Navy officer who commanded three ships has worked with \nApplicant for over eight years in support of Navy shipbuilding contracts.  He found \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant to be one of the top ten employees working on his projects.  Applicant was \none of the most trustworthy and reliable people who could solve problems.  He \ndiscussed with her issues about the concern she had for her mother and found her to be \nproud of her role as a daughter.  She was also proud of her service and work.  Applicant \nhas earned the trust of everyone at work. (Tr. 65-71) \n \nAnother witness testified that he has a background in engineering and national \ndefense industry but presently works for a congressional intelligence committee.  He \nconsiders Applicant to be the model immigrant who came to the United States and \nimmersed herself into the culture.  He considers Applicant to be a caring and \ntrustworthy person.  (Tr. 72-77) \n \nAnother witness testified that he worked with Applicant as a defense contractor.  \nHe considers Applicant to be a trustworthy person of excellent character. (Tr. 77-81) \n \nA personal friend testified she has known Applicant for over 12 years and \nconsiders Applicant to be a wonderful patriotic American citizen who fully participates in \npatriotic events.  She considers Applicant to be trustworthy.  She traveled out of the \ncountry with Applicant and observed her conduct to be appropriate and above board. (T. \n81-86) \n \nA Navy reserve officer testified that he has known and worked with Applicant for \nover 12 years.  He views Applicant as a fine outstanding citizen.  Applicant is \ntrustworthy who is a valuable asset to Navy contracts. (Tr. 86-90) \n \nApplicant presented six letters of recommendation.  The letters were from \nsupervisors and co-workers.  They include retired Navy officers and an astronaut.  All of \nthese letters attested to Applicants excellent work performance.  They all noted that she \nis a proud and valued United States citizen.  They considered her trustworthy and \nreliable.  (Applicant Exhibits C, D, E, F, G, and K, Letters dated March 4, March 10, \nMarch 17, March 18, and March 21, 2008) \n \nIran is a country that has been hostile to the United States since the 1979 \nrevolution that overthrew the former pro-western government.  Iran\u2019s support for terrorist \ngroups has long concerned the United States.  Iran\u2019s human rights practices are also a \nconcern for the United States.  The Iranian theocratic government has repressed its \npeople, pursued weapons of mass destruction, initiated a nuclear program that may \ninclude nuclear weapons, and continues to support terrorism in Iraq and around the \nworld.  Iran is known to conduct intelligence operations and economic espionage \nagainst the United States.  There is no direct evidence in the record concerning Iranian \nespionage activity towards or within the United States, but this hostile relationship \nsupports the inference that Iran would seek to damage or counter United States military \ncapabilities by seeking to obtain classified or sensitive information when possible.  The \nUnited States Department of State warns United States citizens, particularly United \nStates citizens of Iranian origin, to consider carefully the risks of travel to Iran.  Iran \ndoes not recognize renunciation of citizenship by those born there, and has detained \n\n \n7 \n \n \nand harassed naturalized United States citizens traveling there.  Applicant and her \nmother are aware of the dangerous nature of the regime and intentionally minimize her \ntrips to Iran.  The continued support for terrorism and human rights violations \ncontributed to President Bush\u2019s strong criticism of Iran in his 2002 State of the Union \nmessage and his designation of Iran as one of the \u201cAxis of Evil.\u201d  Iran is a nation whose \ninterests are inimical to the United States.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n8 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThere is a security concern because foreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in the U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interests.  Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity \nof the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is location, \nincluding but not limited to, such consideration as whether the foreign country is known \nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \na risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6) \n \n \nApplicant has frequent and close contact with her mother who is a citizen and \nresident of Iran.  She visited her mother a number of times in Iran and her mother visits \nApplicant in the United States.  Applicant\u2019s last trip to Iran to see her mother was about \na year ago.  This type of contact raises security concerns under Foreign Influence \nDisqualifying Conditions (FI DC) AG \u00b6 79(a) (Contact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion); and FI DC AG \u00b6 7(b) (Connections to \na foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of \ninterest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology \nand the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation).  The mere existence of a foreign family member is not sufficient.  The \nnature of Applicant\u2019s contact with the family member must be examined to determine \nwhether it creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion.  \u201cHeightened\u201d is a relative term denoting increased risk over \nsome normally existing risk that can be said to be inherent anytime a family member \nlives subject to a foreign government.  One factor that heightens the risk in Applicant\u2019s \ncase is the nature of the Iranian government and its hostility towards the United States. \n \n \nApplicant also has some property interests in Iran that she inherited from her \nfather and holds with her mother and brother.  These property interests raise FI DC AG \n\u00b6 7(e) (A substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in \nany foreign-owned or foreign operated business, which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation).  I do not find that Applicant being \n\n \n9 \n \n \ndetained for a short time by Iranian authorities in 1997 was a security concern.  \nApplicant was not singled out for attention but was retained for a short time with other \nUnited States citizens of Iranian birth for their passports to be copied.  This was a \nroutine action by Iranian authorities. \n \n \nI have considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) AG \u00b6 8(a) (the \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of \nthe U.S.); FI MC AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the \nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest; FI MC AG \u00b6 8(c) (Contact or communication with \nforeign citizens is so casual or infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could \ncreated a risk for foreign influence or exploitation); and FI MC AG \u00b6 8(f) (The value or \nroutine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interest is such that they are \nunlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate \nor pressure the individual).  \n \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d  The Appeal Board consistently \napplied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise was that \nan applicant should not be placed in a position where he or she is forced to make a \nchoice between the interest of the family member and the interest of the United States.  \n(See, ISCR Case No. 03-17620, App. Bd, Apr. 17, 2006; ISCR Case No. 03-24933, \nApp. Bd. Jul. 28, 2005; ISCR Case No. 03-02382, App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005; and ISCR \nCase No. 03-15205, App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005).  Thus, an administrative judge was not \npermitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the \nnew guidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to \ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. \n \n \nThe nature of the government of Iran, its disregard for human rights, and its \nintent to seek information on United States technology place a heavy burden on \nApplicant in mitigating the disqualifying conditions and the security concerns.  Applicant \nhas a close relationship with her mother.  Her mother is a 78 year old widow who has no \ncontact or relationship with the Iranian government.  However, there could be a \ncircumstance where Applicant is placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of her mother and the government or interests of the United States because of \nthe nature of the Iranian government.  Accordingly, FI MC Ag \u00b6 8(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nIt is clear from Applicant\u2019s testimony as well as the discussions regarding her \nmother she had with her co-workers that the relationship with her mother is not casual \n\n \n10 \n \n \nor infrequent.  Applicant herself describes it as very close.  Applicant and her mother \nrealize that there is a risk for Applicant to go to Iran, and they try to meet in an area \noutside Iran.  Applicant tried to have her mother live with her in the United States but the \narrangement did not work.  Since Applicant and her mother are concerned about her \ntrips to Iran, there must be likelihood that their contact could create the risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  Since the relationship with her mother was not casual and \ninfrequent, FI DC AG \u00b6 8 (c) does not apply to her relationship with her mother.   \n \n \nOn the contrary, while not listed as a security concern, I note that her relationship \nwith her aunt and uncle in Iran are casual and infrequent.  She sees them only when \nshe visits Iran and talks to them only if they are at her mother\u2019s house when she calls.  \nShe last saw her aunt and uncle over a year ago.  Her relationship with them is casual \nand infrequent.  Applicant\u2019s trips to Iran do not show an interest in Iran or its \ngovernment, but were taken for the sole purpose of visiting her mother.  The trips were \nnot made because of her desire to see Iran or for government purposes.  The trips to \nIran do not create a security concern. \n \n \nApplicant has some claim to her father\u2019s property in Iran.  Her father purchased a \ncondominium in her name when she was a child.  She also has a claim to some \nproperties her father owned with his brothers and two other condominiums that her \nfamily owns and uses on the Caspian Sea.  However, she turned over her rights to the \nproperty by giving her mother a power of attorney to do whatever she can with the \nproperties so that her interests are minimal.  She does not expect to receive any \nproceeds from these properties.  Since her interests in the properties are minimal and \ngranted to and controlled by her mother, it is unlikely that her interests will result in a \nconflict and could not be used to influence, manipulate or pressure her.  She has \nestablished FI MC AG \u00b6 8(f) as to the property interests. \n \n \nApplicant has little if any sense of loyalty to Iran.  She spent only her early years \nin Iran.  The revolutionary government of Iran caused her family to lose a lot of their \nwealth, so that her father never returned to the country.  She has established by \ntestimony of those that have known her for many years that she has a deep sense of \nloyalty and admiration for the United States and its way of life.  There was testimony \nfrom many retired and former military officers who understand a sense of loyalty and \nobligation.  There was testimony from colleagues and friends who work in the defense \nindustry who hold security clearances and understand the requirements to receive \naccess to classified information.  Applicant came to the United States as a teenager and \nreceived her professional education here.  She became a United States citizen as soon \nas she could, married United States citizens, and has been successful working in the \ndefense industries.  She sees the United States as offering her freedom, justice, and \ntolerance with an opportunity to reach her potential.  Her sense of loyalty or obligation is \nnot to Iran but to the United States.  A conflict of interest in this case is extremely \nunlikely.  In balancing all of the factors mentioned and considered above, I am satisfied \nApplicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is such that she can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States interest.  Accordingly, Applicant has met \nher heavy burden to show that her contacts with her mother in Iran and her trips to Iran \n\n \n11 \n \n \ndo not cause a security concern.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated security concerns \nrising from her contact with her mother in Iran, her minimal property interest in Iran, and \nher trips to Iran.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Preference \n \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \ncountry over the United States, then he may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9)  Applicant \napplied for an Iranian passport after obtaining United States citizenship.  Iran considers \nher an Iranian citizen because she was born in Iran.  She applied for the passport \nbecause of United States State Department guidance that suggests United States \ncitizens of Iranian birth considered dual United States and Iranian citizenship use such a \npassport to enter or leave Iran.  She possessed and used that passport to enter Iran as \nlate as 2007.  Even though there is State Department guidance to have an Iranian \npassport, her possession of the Iranian passport raises Foreign Preference \nDisqualifying Condition (FP DC) AG \u00b6 10(a) (Exercise of any right, privilege, or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the \nforeign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport.)   \n \nApplicant raised Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FP MC) AG \u00b6 11(b) \n(The individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship), and FP MC \nAG \u00b6 11(e) (The passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.)  Applicant does not know of any procedure \naccepted by the Iranian government to renounce her Iranian citizenship.  She \nexpressed a willingness to renounce any claim to Iranian citizenship provided it did not \nadversely affect her mother.  The Iranian passport is a current passport but has been \nturned over to her facility security officer, a cognizant security official.  She knows if she \nasks for the passport back and uses it, she will also lose her security clearance and \naccess to classified information.  Applicant has mitigated security concerns for foreign \npreference raised by her current Iranian passport. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \n\n \n12 \n \n \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I carefully considered all of the \ncircumstances discussed above in regard to disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \nwell as the following factors in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  The \u201cwhole person\u201d \nconcept requires consideration of all available information about Applicant, not a single \nitem in isolation, to reach a common sense determination concerning Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness.  Applicant has a close relationship with her mother in Iran.  These \nsimple facts alone might be sufficient to raise security concerns over Applicant\u2019s \nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  However, mere family ties with \npeople in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  \nWhether an applicant\u2019s family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a \ncommon sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of the family ties.   \n \nApplicant has strong loyalties to the United States and a strong lack of loyalty for \nIran.  She has successfully held a security clearance for over 15 years even though her \nrelationship with her mother was a known factor.  She is regarded as loyal, trustworthy, \nand reliable by those that work and know her.  Many of them are former Navy officers, \ngovernment, or contractor officials.  They know and understand the qualifications for \naccess to classified information and have themselves made judgments on people for \naccess to classified information.  Applicant has established her deep loyalty to the \nUnited States.  She established that she has no loyalty to Iran or its government.  Her \nloyalty is to her mother who happens to reside in Iran.  Overall, on balance the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has met \nthe particularly heavy burden of mitigating all potential security concerns arising from \nher family member and property interest in Iran as well as her current Iranian passport.  \nAccordingly I find that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign \ninfluence and foreign preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on November 8,\n2004. On September 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nB for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 1, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on October 2,\n2007. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 20, 2007, and I\nreceived the case assignment on November 27, 2007.  DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on December 17, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 8,\n2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without\nFebruary 26, 2008\n\n2\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through F,\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 22,\n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (Tr. 14) The request\nand the attached documents were admitted into evidence and included in the record as\nExhibit 4. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 1, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request\nfor eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant is 49 years old, married with two children, and works for a defense\ncontractor.  He worked in this job for the past three years.  He received an interim\nsecurity clearance, which was removed when the SOR was issued.  He obtained a\nPh.D. in experimental physics from a U.S. university in 1996.  He obtained his\nbachelor\u2019s degree in engineering at a PRC university.  After graduating, he worked for a\ncompany in the PRC for three years before obtaining a scholarship to a U.S. university.\nHe came to the United States in 1987, and became a U.S. citizen in 1999.  Applicant\u2019s\ntwo children were born in the United States.  His wife came to the United States from\nthe PRC in 1990. (Tr. 21-24, 38, 62-67; Exhibits 1, 2)\nApplicant has a younger sister and brother.  The brother is a U.S. citizen living in\nanother state from Applicant\u2019s residence.  His sister lives in the PRC, and has one child.\nAs children, they had a close relationship.  Applicant\u2019s sister works as a technician.\nApplicant applied to have his sister and her daughter immigrate to the United States, but\nit will be at least four years before she can move here.  Applicant calls his sister monthly\nto \u201ckeep up her spirits.\u201d Applicant\u2019s parents are deceased, his mother in 2000, and his\nfather in November 2007.  When alive, they worked as seismologists in the PRC.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution in the PRC in the 1960s, Applicant characterized them as\n\u201cvictims during cultural revolution.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s father knew the Japanese and English\nlanguages, so he was labeled by the PRC government as \u201csub-class,\u201d someone not to\nbe trusted by the PRC government. (Tr. 25, 27, 29,  34, 66-70, 75; Exhibits 1, 2, C)\nApplicant traveled to the PRC in November 2007, for his father\u2019s funeral.  He had\nnot been there for about 16 years.  At this funeral, he saw his uncle and his wife.  He did\nnot see or talk with any other relatives on that trip.  When his mother died, he did not\nhave a U.S. passport, and he had lost his PRC passport, which had already expired.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s wife and children went to the PRC for his mother\u2019s funeral.  Following the\ndeath of his parents, Applicant does not forsee any travel to the PRC in the near future,\nbecause he does not think there will be any need for such travel. (Tr. 27, 34, 35)\nApplicant\u2019s wife has two brothers and her parents still living in the PRC.  One\nbrother is scheduled to immigrate to Canada by the end of January 2008.  He is a\nelectrical engineer who works for a water company.  He is going to Canada, in part,\nbecause he thinks there will be more water projects there for him to gain employment.\nThe other brother works as a salesman for a medical products company in the PRC.\nApplicant\u2019s wife wants this brother to immigrate to the United States.  Her parents are\nretired.  She telephones them monthly, and speaks with her brothers every few months.\nThe parents visited their daughter in the United States three times in the past 20 years,\nstaying 30 days to 18 months during these visits.  Applicant\u2019s wife became a U.S.\ncitizen in September 2000.  In 1998 and in 2000, Applicant\u2019s wife traveled to the PRC.\nThe first trip was to visit her family.  The second trip was to attend Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s\nfuneral.  She has made two additional trips since 2000 for pleasure reasons.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is employed in the computer engineering business. Applicant speaks\nwith his mother-in-law once or twice a year, and he does not talk with his brothers-in-\nlaw.  (Tr. 28-32, 35-38; Exhibits 1, 3, B, D, E)\nApplicant\u2019s children are enrolled in a martial arts school.  Their instructor testified\nabout the commitment Applicant has to his children.  Two co-workers of Applicant\ntestified about his good work ethic and adherence to security procedures at the\nemployer\u2019s work site.  His employee evaluation stated he had excellent laboratory skills.\nHis site manager submitted a strong letter of recommendation for Applicant. (Tr. 39-62;\nExhibits A, F)\nI take administrative notice of the following facts.  The PRC is a one-party\nCommunist totalitarian state.  It has an economy growing at 10% annually, and\nexpanding military forces, including its naval forces.  It engages in industrial and military\nespionage on a regular basis against the United States and other countries.  The United\nStates and the PRC have been rivals since 1948, when the Communists took control of\nmainland China, and the Nationalist government fled to the island of Taiwan.  Taiwan\nremains an issue of contention between the two countries.  The U.S. - China Economic\nand Security Review Commission\u2019s 2006 report to the U.S. Congress found the PRC\nhas a large and aggressive intelligence gathering operation in the United States,\nparticularly in the scientific and military fields.   Additionally, the U.S. State Department\nreported the PRC has a poor human rights record, including but not limited to,\nsuppressing political dissent, using arbitrary arrests, forced confessions, and\nmistreatment of prisoners as part of its operational methods to maintain control of its\npopulation. (Exhibit 4)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n4\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG &6:      \nGuideline B:  The Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial\ninterests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign\ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG &7(a) (contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) and \u00b67.b (connections to a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that\ninformation). Applicant speaks monthly with his sister, and infrequently with his wife\u2019s\nfamily.  Applicant is trying to bring his sister and her daughter to the United States to\nlive, but it will take at least four years to accomplish this move.  This move is dependent\nupon the approvals of the PRC and U.S. governments, thereby creating a potential\nconflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s desire to help his sister and his obligation to\nprotect classified information.  The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from foreign influence.  I considered the mitigating conditions \u00b68.a (the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of the foreign individual and the interests of the U.S.), and \u00b68.b (there is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests).  Applicant\u2019s close ties of affection and\nfamily to his sister, and the historical record of PRC espionage, particularly in the\nscientific area, make it likely that Applicant could be placed in a situation where he\nwould have to choose between his desire to have his sister live in the United States,\n\n6\nand the PRC\u2019s desire for classified information. Thus, I conclude that mitigating\ncondition \u00b68.a does not apply.  Next, Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty to his sister is great,\nnot minimal, even though he has been a U.S. citizen for 18 years.  It is not clear how\nApplicant might resolve any conflict of interest.  AG \u00b62.b states, \u201cAny doubt concerning\npersonnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\u201d That requirement is applicable here. I conclude these\npotentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant\u2019s education,\nhis U.S. citizenship, the immigration of his brother and wife to the United States, the\nbirth of his children in the United States, making them native-born U.S. citizens,\nApplicant\u2019s work record, his presentation at the hearing, and his age and maturity.  I\nalso considered the potential for coercion by the PRC against someone who has a close\nrelative in the PRC who wants to emigrate, and that the Applicant, if granted a\nclearance, would have access to classified information within the range of classified and\nproprietary material the PRC traditionally collects.  \nThe result of this analysis is that I conclude the foreign influence security concern\nagainst Applicant.  I also conclude the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Eligibility for a security clearance and access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 3, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan ESPQ version of a Security Clearance Application (SF 86). On November 8, 2007, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged \nsecurity concerns under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nSeptember 9, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nreferral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nOn December 29, 2005, the President promulgated revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information, and on \nAugust 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a \nmemorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nfor all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and Department \nof Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (January 1987), as \namended and modified (Regulation), in which the SOR was issued on or after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  The AG applies to Applicant\u2019s case because his SOR was issued \nafter September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant received the SOR on November 25, 2007. In a sworn, written \nstatement, dated November 26, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and \nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated the \nGovernment was prepared to proceed on April 8, 2008, and the case was assigned to \nme on April 11, 2008. A Notice of Hearing was issued that same day, and I convened \nthe hearing, as scheduled, on May 8, 2008. \n \nDuring the hearing, three Government exhibits and three Applicant exhibits were \nreceived and admitted, some over objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) was received on May 16, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the factual allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b., 1.c., and 2.a.) of the SOR with explanations, and denied the remaining allegations. \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nretain a SECRET security clearance.  He has been employed as an integration and test \nengineer by the same government contractor since July 2005.1 Prior to his current \nemployment he was on active duty with the U.S. Navy from August 1999 until June \n2004, and honorably discharged as a Petty Officer 2nd Class (E-5)2; a field engineer with \nanother defense contractor from June 2004 until April 2005; and unemployed from April \n2005 until July 2005.3 \n \nThere are two differing scenarios regarding an incident that transpired on March \n23, 2005, which is the sole focus of the SOR.  The first scenario, described below, is \nthat of the Applicant, and is supported by his Answer to SOR and testimony; the second \n \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated Nov. 3, 2005), at 2. \n \n2 Id. at 3-4 \n \n3 Id. at 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n so.  \n                                                          \none, from the then-employer, supported by an Adverse Information Report, is described \nthereafter. \n \nOn March 23, 2005, Applicant was offered a job from a competing defense \ncontractor program manager which would have increased his then-current salary by \n$20,000.00.4 Applicant informed his then-current program manager (PM) and asked if \nhis employer could match the offer. His PM was apparently \u201cfurious\u201d at the competitor \nbecause he had already lost another employee to them.5   \n \nThat same evening, at about 10:30 p.m., after having dinner, Applicant and a \nfemale companion (who was a cleared employee working for the same Command at \nanother location)6 entered the closed military facility after passing two checkpoints, \nincluding a gate guard who touched Applicant\u2019s badge. Their original purpose for being \non the facility at that time was for her to drop Applicant off for work and then borrow his \nautomobile.7 Instead, they drove around the perimeter of the base and parked for a \nscenic view overlooking the ocean.8 Applicant\u2019s companion said she needed to use the \nrestroom so they drove to the unsecured building where he worked, entered it, and he \nescorted her to the restroom which was outside of the secured laboratory.9 He never \ntook, or attempted to take, her into the laboratory itself.10 Applicant called to a colleague \nto meet her in the hallway.  Shortly thereafter, they departed the area and drove back to \nthe restaurant to pick up her car.11  \n \nApplicant had worked his shift from 10 p.m. the previous day until 6 a.m. that \nday.  The established policy was to have flexible hours if anyone worked overtime \nearlier in the week, and it was noted on the time card.12 Applicant did not work the \nentire period he was scheduled to do\n13\n \nThe following day, a security stand down day,14 his PM informed Applicant that \nhis employer could offer him a salary increase, but because the amount did not match \n \n4 Tr. at 48. \n \n5 Answer to SOR, dated Nov. 26, 2007, at 1. \n \n6 Tr. at 33. \n \n7 Id. at 34. \n \n8 Id. \n \n9 Id. at 34-35, 37. \n \n10 Id. at 35-36. \n \n11 Answer to SOR, supra note 5, at 2-3. \n \n12 Tr. at 30. \n \n13 Id. at 39. \n \n14 Id. at 57. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nthe competitor\u2019s offer, Applicant stated he was still undecided as to what his decision \nwould be.15  \n \nOn March 29, 2005, Applicant\u2019s PM called regarding the decision, and Applicant \ntold him he decided to submit his two week notice. The PM told him to type his letter of \nresignation stating his last day of work, and Applicant did so.16  He also commented \nabout the \u201cincident\u201d of March 23rd and added that if Applicant could keep the next two \nweeks clean, he would have his \u201cgoing-away\u201d party the next week.  Two hours later, \nApplicant was told he was being placed on administrative leave until the \u201cincident\u201d could \nbe resolved. That evening, the PM came to Applicant\u2019s apartment and requested \nstatements from Applicant and his female friend and picked up Applicant\u2019s badge.17  \nThe statements were e-mailed as requested.18   \n \nThe following day, the PM called Applicant and asked to meet him as the security \noffice.  Applicant was questioned by an investigator and subsequently advised by the \nPM that \u201c. . . hopefully they just revoke access for 6 months and you can continue your \ncareer and we can still be friends.\u201d19 The end result was that Applicant was terminated \nfrom his job, effective March 31, 2005.20 Although Applicant had anticipated \ncommencing employment with his new employer on April 18, 2005,21 because he was \nnow barred from the facility, the offer was withdrawn.22  \n \nThe scenario offered by the then-employer Facility Security Officer is markedly \ndifferent from that described above.   \n \nOn March 23, 2005, at some time between 10:30 p.m. and 12:00 a.m., Applicant \n\u201cknowingly and willfully snuck an unauthorized girlfriend onto the . . . Naval Base and \nattempted to bring her into a classified lab. . . .  Another employee stopped [Applicant] \nfrom bringing his guest into the classified lab and told him to get her off of the base.\u201d23 \n \nThe issue of the falsified timecard was described as follows: \n \n \n15 Answer to SOR, supra note 5, at 1. \n \n16 Tr. at 53-55. \n  \n17 Id. at 64. \n \n18 Answer to SOR, supra note 5, at 2. \n \n19 Id. \n \n20 Tr. at 38, 65. \n \n21 Id. at 60. \n \n22 Id. at 67. \n \n23 Government Exhibit 2 (Adverse Information Report, dated Apr. 5, 2005). \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n. . . He then left the base but did not return until approximately 3:00 a.m.  It \nwas further uncovered that [Applicant] falsified his timecard given that he \nreported he worked the hours of 9:30 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. but was off the \nbase from approximately 9:30 p.m. to 3:00 a.m.24 \n \nApplicant\u2019s candor was characterized as follows: \n \n. . . His version of the events has also changed several times and what we \nwere told by [Applicant] is slightly different than what he told the . . . base \ninvestigators.25 \n \nAs of April 5, 2005, the incident had been reported to the Command security \noffice and \u201cis currently under investigation\u201d26, and Applicant\u2019s access privileges to the \nbase and lab were temporarily revoked until further notice. Applicant was put on \nadministrative leave immediately so that the then-employer might investigate the \nincident.27 Nevertheless, with the understanding that Applicant had previously given \nnotice of his intent to terminate his employment on March 29, 2005, it was decided that  \nhe should be terminated, effective March 31, 2005, because the investigation of the \nincident was apparently completed and something unspecified was \u201cuncovered.\u201d28  \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s scenario contained some uncertainty regarding the specific \ndates certain actions occurred, his explanation has the ring of truth.  On the other hand, \nwhile it appears the then-employer, as well as the Command security office, had \nconducted an inquiry or investigation of the incident which occurred on March 23, 2005, \nno such reports of inquiry or investigation, along with interview statements of Applicant \nand witnesses, have been submitted. Instead, there are findings, conclusions, and \ncharacterizations unsupported by specifics other than what was alleged in the Adverse \nInformation Report. \n \nFor example, the report stated Applicant \u201cwillfully snuck an unauthorized \ngirlfriend\u201d onto the base and \u201cattempted to bring her into a classified lab\u201d but was \nstopped by another employee. There is nothing in evidence as to how he \u201cwillfully \nsnuck\u201d someone on base, or how he \u201cattempted\u201d to bring her into the classified lab, or \nwho, and under what circumstances, the unidentified employee stopped him. In \naddition, it is alleged that his version of the events changed several times, but there is \nno explanation as to what his versions were or how they differed. Under the \ncircumstances, considering the conflicting interpretations of the actions and the incident, \nas well as the very sparse evidence presented by the Government, I accept Applicant\u2019s \nexplanations rather than the Government\u2019s unsupported interpretations of same. \n \n24 Id. \n  \n25 Id. \n \n26 Id. \n \n27 Id. \n \n28 Id. \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nSince becoming employed by his current employer, Applicant was closely \nmonitored by the Facility Security Officer because of the earlier incident with his former \nemployer.  After 18 months of \u201cstellar security performance,\u201d Applicant was selected \nand trained to be COMSEC Custodian, a position he handled with \u201csuperior results.\u201d29  \nHe has also been recognized by the Commander, USCENTAF, and his Program \nManager for his contributions to the mission.30 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised Adjudicative Guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d31 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n29 Applicant Exhibit C (Letter from Facility Security Officer, dated May 5, 2008). \n \n30 Applicant Exhibit B (Certificate signed by a Lieutenant General, USAF, and Letter from Program Manager, \ndated January 27, 2007). \n \n31 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of  \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information \nis set out in AG \u00b6 33:       \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 34(g) \u201cany failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Department Counsel has identified this \nas the sole condition of this particular guideline possibly pertinent to this case,32 and I \nconcur. Applicant purportedly violated two rules. First, there was some otherwise \nunidentified and unspecified rule regarding permitting access to the facility when he \ndrove onto the base, or as referred to by his then-Facility Security Officer, \u201csnuck\u201d her \nonto the base, during a time period in which he was to work and his companion had no \nlegitimate business reason for being there. The actual \u201crule\u201d has not been specified, \ndetailed, discussed, or otherwise offered by the Government. It is impossible to \ndetermine if a spouse, companion, or driver who accompanies a cleared employee onto \nthe base is also violating the supposed rule. According to the Government, at that time, \nher mere presence on the base required advanced permission for her to enter the base, \nregardless of her status.  It should be noted, however, that this aspect of the argument \nis not alleged in the SOR, for the SOR allegation only refers to his \u201cattempt\u201d to bring the \n \n32 Tr. at 72. \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nunauthorized person into the classified area elsewhere referred to as the laboratory, but \nnot the base itself. \nThe other aspect of the case refers to his purported \u201cattempt\u201d to bring his \ncompanion into the secured laboratory.  The Government has presented an Adverse \nInformation Report that Applicant had attempted to do just that, but was prevented from \ndoing so by an unidentified employee. Applicant has countered that report with evidence \nin support of his contention that his companion needed to use the restroom so they \ndrove to the unsecured building where he worked, entered it, and he escorted her to the \nrestroom which was outside of the secured laboratory. He never took, or attempted to \ntake, her into the laboratory itself.  Except for the evidence submitted by Applicant, the \nrecord is silent regarding the location or security status of the restroom. I found \nApplicant\u2019s statement at the hearing to be consistent and credible. Because of the \npaucity of evidence contradicting him, I find that AG \u00b6 34(g) is refuted by Applicant\u2019s \nmore compelling and plausible evidence. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from handling protected information. Under AG \u00b6 35(a), the \ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where \u201cso much time has elapsed since the \nbehavior, or it has happened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that \nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  Similarly, AG \u00b6 35(b), may apply where \u201cthe \nindividual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training and now \ndemonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities.\u201d   \n \nIn this instance, I will assume the purported \u201csecurity violations\u201d occurred on \nMarch 23, 2005\u2014three years before the date of the hearing\u2014and Applicant was briefly \nput on administrative leave and, in part, because he had already submitted his notice \nintending to take another job with a competitor, terminated. Whether his punishment \nand termination were appropriate due to the circumstances, or due to rumor or \ninnuendo, or simply retaliation and reprisal for attempting to join a competitor is unclear.  \nWhat is clear is that since that time, after being closely monitored by his current Facility \nSecurity Officer for 18 months, Applicant was selected and trained to be COMSEC \nCustodian, a position he has handled with \u201csuperior results.\u201d Applicant has clearly \nmaintained and demonstrated a \u201cpositive attitude toward the discharge of security \nresponsibilities.\u201d Considering the totality of the evidence, I find that, assuming AG \u00b6 \n34(g) is established, then AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(a) and 35(b) apply to mitigate the security concerns. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15:       \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, and \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant \nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other \nofficial government representative@ is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 \n16(c), Acredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, \nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information@ may raise security concerns.  \nIn addition, AG \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected \ninformation. This includes but is not limited to consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, \nrelease of proprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other \ngovernment protected information: \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace;  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time or \nresources,\u201d may apply. \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nApplicant has admitted he \u201cfalsified\u201d his timecard pertaining to March 23-24, \n2005, but explained that was the acceptable practice in place with his supervisor \ncovering flexible time or overtime work.  If such informal practice was acceptable to the \nsupervisor is only one aspect of the issue, because it apparently was not acceptable to \nthe employer. Unfortunately, the Adverse Information Report does not address this \nissue other than to say Applicant \u201cfalsified his timecard.\u201d As to the falsified timecard, I \nfind AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b), 16(c), and 16(d) apply in this case. As to the alleged \u201cattempt to bring \nan unauthorized person into the secured laboratory, I find AG \u00b6 16(c) applies. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 17(c), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment.@ Similarly, AG \u00b6 17(d) may apply where the evidence shows Athe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.@  Also, AG \u00b6 17(f) may apply where \u201cthe information was \nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d \nFalsifying a timecard is not a minor offense.  However, in this instance, Applicant \ncontends the informal practice was acceptable to his supervisor, even if it may not have \nbeen acceptable to the employer.  Nevertheless, three years have passed since the \nincident, and it was apparently an isolated action identified by his employer.  Neither \nalleged action by Applicant constituted a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. After \nbeing under intense scrutiny by his current employer for over 18 months, the \ncircumstances have changed, the conduct has not recurred, and it is not likely to recur.  \nAs to the falsified timecard, I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) apply.  As to the alleged \n\u201cattempt to bring an unauthorized person into the secured laboratory, I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) \nand 17(f) apply. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.33        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. In March 2005, Applicant informed \nhis PM of an offer of employment from a competitor, entered the military facility with a \nfriend in his automobile, and accompanied her to the unsecured restroom near his \nsecured laboratory. Although he was supposed to be working, he apparently had an \ninformal flexible work schedule and entered what might be considered constructive \ninformation on his timecard. Nevertheless, the information was not accurate, and \nApplicant admitted the time card did not contain accurate information. Some form of \ninquiry or investigation was performed and Applicant was placed on administrative leave \nand terminated. As a result, because he was now barred from the facility, the offer of \nemployment by the competitor was withdrawn. (See AG && 2(a)(1), 2(a)(2), 2(a)(3), \n2(a)(5), and 2(a)(7).  \n \nThe two components of the isolated episode, the disputed issue of bringing an \n\u201cunauthorized\u201d person on base and purportedly \u201cattempting\u201d to bring her into a classified \nlaboratory, as well as the falsification of the timecard, both occurred over three years \nbefore the hearing.  Additionally, since that time, Applicant was closely monitored for 18 \nmonths, and eventually selected and trained to be COMSEC Custodian. He has \nhandled the position with \u201csuperior results.\u201d And, he has clearly maintained and \ndemonstrated a \u201cpositive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities.\u201d As \nsuch, there appears to be little likelihood of recurrence and the potential of pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress because of the incident(s) is low. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his handling protected \ninformation and personal conduct concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n33 Although I find Applicant\u2019s conduct mitigated under the individual guidelines as previously indicated, I also \nseparately find security concerns mitigated under the whole person concept. \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 28-year-old single woman who has been employed as a technician by a defense contractor since March 2005. Her previous reported employment history consisted of working for different employers as: 1) a circuit assembler from June 1999 to February 2000; 2) an assembler from February 2000 to April 2002; 3) an assembler from February 2004 to October 2004; and 4) an electronics assembler form September 2004 to March 2005.

Applicant submitted an\nundated response to the SOR that was notarized on October 10, 2007. Applicant admitted\nthe SOR allegations contained in subparagraphs 1.b, 2.c and 2.d, denied the allegations\ncontained in subparagraphs 1.a, 2.a, and 2.b, and requested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJanuary 31, 2008\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on November 20, 2007. A notice of hearing was\nissued on November 29, 2007, scheduling the hearing for December 18, 2007. The\nhearing was conducted as scheduled. \nThe government submitted eight documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-8. GE 1 was admitted into the record without objection.\nAdmission of GE 2 into the record was rejected based on my objection. Administrative\nnotice was taken of the contents of GE 3-8 without objection. Department Counsel\nsubmitted a document containing written comments on the contents of GE 3-8 for my\nconsideration which was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex. I) and made part of the\nrecord without objection. Applicant testified and submitted one documentary exhibit that\nwas marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1 and admitted into the record without objection. The\nrecord was held open to allow Applicant time to submit additional documentation in support\nof her case. Twenty-nine additional documents were timely received, marked as AE 2-30,\nand made part of the record without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding\nmemorandum of AE 2-30 was marked as App. Ex. II and made part of the record. The\ntranscript was received on January 4, 2008.     \nProcedural Matters\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR\nby adding a subparagraph 2.e to read \u201cYour step-father is a citizen and resident of Cuba.\u201d\nThat amendment was allowed. Applicant thereafter admitted the allegation and stated she\ndid not require additional time to respond to the newly added allegation. The requested\namendment was made on the face of the SOR. \n \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 28-year-old single woman who has been employed as a technician\nby a defense contractor since March 2005. Her previous reported employment history\nconsisted of working for different employers as: 1) a circuit assembler from June 1999 to\nFebruary 2000; 2) an assembler from February 2000 to April 2002; 3) an assembler from\nFebruary 2004 to October 2004; and 4) an electronics assembler form September 2004\nto March 2005. She also reports periods of unemployment from January 1998 to February\n2000, and from February 2002 to February 2004. She has never possessed a security\nclearance.\nApplicant graduated high school in Cuba in 1999. She attended college for several\nyears in that country majoring in veterinary studies but did not obtain a degree. She has\nattended college since immigrating to the United States in 1998, but again has not earned\na degree. Although Applicant has never been married, she cohabitated with a native born\nUnited States citizen for a period of time in a domestic relationship. She has two sons from\nthat relationship, ages 4 and 3, who reside with her and who receive child support from\ntheir father.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s father immigrated to the United States in or about 1979 during what has\nbecome known as the Muriel Boat Lift. He left his family, consisting of his wife and\nApplicant, in Cuba at the time. He became a United States citizen in April 1994. Applicant\u2019s\nmother began a domestic relationship with a man in Cuba after her husband immigrated\nto the United States although they never married. Applicant has a half-brother who was\nborn in July 1981 from that relationship. Applicant was raised by her mother\u2019s boyfriend,\nwho she considers her step-father, until she immigrated to the United States in 1998.\nApplicant\u2019s mother and this man separated about 5 years ago.\nApplicant\u2019s entry into the United States was sponsored by her father in 1998. She\nresided with him for awhile before moving out on her own. She has resided in five different\nresidences, all in the same general area, since immigrating to the United States. Applicant\nbecame a United States citizen in June 2004, and obtained a U.S. passport in February\n2005. \nApplicant sponsored her mother\u2019s entry into the United States in 2004. Her mother\nhas permanent resident alien status in the U.S. and intends to become a U.S. citizen when\neligible. Applicant\u2019s brother has been living in the United States since 2004 on a work\npermit, but has applied for permanent resident alien status. Applicant\u2019s mother is 48 years\nold, her brother is 26 years old, and both are Cuban citizens. Applicant\u2019s mother works for\na staffing agency part-time while her brother is employed full-time. They reside with\nApplicant and her children. \nApplicant\u2019s maternal grandmother, who is approximately 80 years old, is a citizen\nand resident of Cuba. Applicant\u2019s mother calls Applicant\u2019s grandmother about once a\nmonth and Applicant speaks with her grandmother when she is present during those calls.\nApplicant\u2019s mother sporadically sends relatively small amounts of money to her\ngrandmother. Applicant\u2019s step-father remains a citizen and resident of Cuba. Applicant\u2019s\nbrother calls his father about once a month and Applicant also talks to him when she is\naround during those calls. Applicant has three maternal aunts and one maternal uncle who\nare citizens and residents of Cuba. She also has one paternal aunt who is a citizen and\nresident of Cuba.  \nApplicant visited her relatives in Cuba in 2001, 2003 and 2004. She used a Cuban\npassport, as required by Cuban law, to enter Cuba during each of those visits. The visit to\nCuba in 2004 occurred just a few days after she became a U.S. citizen. Applicant visited\nwith her mother, brother, step-father, her step-father\u2019s parents, and her maternal relatives\nduring those visits. She did not visit her paternal aunt. She has not visited Cuba since her\nmother and brother immigrated to the United States in 2004. Applicant visited the\nDominican Republic in 2004 and, not having obtained a U.S. passport until February 2005,\napparently used her Cuban passport for that trip.\nApplicant renewed her Cuban passport in March 2004, and retained it after\nbecoming a United States citizen because she would need it if she decided to visit Cuba.\nCuba considers all Cuban-born U.S. citizens, who left Cuba after 1970, to be solely Cuban\ncitizens, and those persons are required to enter and depart Cuba using Cuban passports.\n(AE 1) Applicant\u2019s Cuban passport does not expire until March 2010. She still possessed\nthe Cuban passport at the time of the hearing but indicated at the hearing she was seeking\n\n4\nguidance on how to dispose of it to obtain a security clearance. After the hearing she\nsubmitted a letter from her employer\u2019s Facility Security Officer (FSO) (AE 2) verifying she\nhad surrendered the passport to him, that he would retain it in his custody, and he would\nnotify DOHA if the passport is ever returned to Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s gross weekly salary is $852.50. Her mother is paid $7.15 per hour and,\nas of December 8, 2007, had earned $1,833.42 in 2007. Applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s gross weekly\nsalary is $440.00. Both pay rent to Applicant. Applicant estimated at the hearing that she\nhad several hundred dollars in a savings account and several hundred dollars more in a\nchecking account. She also estimated she has approximately $10,000 in retirement\naccounts and $1,500 in savings accounts for each of her sons. She does not own any real\nestate or have any other substantial assets in the United States. Applicant, her mother and\nher brother do not own any property in Cuba.\nAdministrative notice is taken of the following information about Cuba:\nCuba is a totalitarian police state, which relies on repressive methods to\nmaintain control. These methods, including intense physical and electronic\nsurveillance of Cubans, are also extended to foreign travelers. Americans\nvisiting Cuba should be aware that any encounter with a Cuban could be\nsubject to surreptitious scrutiny by the Castro regime\u2019s secret police, the\nGeneral Directorate for State Security (DGSE). Also, any interactions with\naverage Cubans, regardless of how well intentioned the American is, can\nsubject that Cuban to harassment and/or detention, and other forms of\nrepressive actions, by state security elements. The regime is strongly anti-\nAmerican. . . . (GE 7)\nThe government\u2019s human rights record remained poor, and the government\ncontinued to commit numerous, serious abuses. The government denied\ncitizens the right to change the government. There were at least 283 political\nprisoners and detainees at year\u2019s end (2006). Thousands of citizens served\nsentences for \u201cdangerousness,\u201d in the absence of any criminal activity. The\nfollowing human rights problems were reported: beatings and abuse of\ndetainees and prisoners, including human rights activists, carried out with\nimpunity; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, including denial of\nmedical care; frequent harassment, beatings, and threats against political\nopponents by government-recruited mobs, police, and state security officials;\nfrequent arbitrary arrest and detention of human rights advocates and\nmembers of independent professional organizations; denial of fair trial,\nparticularly to political prisoners; and interference with privacy, including\npervasive monitoring of private communications. (GE 8)\nCuba continued to publicly oppose the U.S.-led Coalition prosecuting the\nWar on Terror. . . . The Government of Cuba provided safe haven to\nmembers of ETA, FARC, and the ELN, and maintained close relationships\nwith other states sponsors of terrorism such as Iran. . . .\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n5\nThe Cuban government continued to permit U.S. fugitives to live legally in\nCuba and is unlikely to satisfy U.S. extradition requests for terrorists\nharbored in the country. The United States periodically requested that the\ngovernment return wanted fugitives, and Cuba continued to be non-\nresponsive. (GE 4)\nThe Castro regime has long targeted the United States for intensive\nespionage activities. Castro himself told CNN in an interview in 1998, \u201cYes,\nwe have sometimes dispatched Cuban citizens to the United States to\ninfiltrate counter-revolutionary organizations, to inform us about activities that\nare of great interest to us. I think we have the right to do this.\u201d \n\u2022\nAna Montes, a Defense Intelligence analyst, confessed to spying for\nCuba for 16 years (from 1985 to the time of her arrest on September\n21, 2001). . . .\n\u2022\nSeven Cuban spies, the so-called Wasp Network, were convicted of\nor confessed to espionage or related crimes in June and September\n2001. . . . (GE 3)    \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guidelines B (foreign influence) and\nC (foreign preference), with their disqualifying and mitigating conditions, are most relevant\nin this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\n\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nForeign preference is a concern because when an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may\nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the\nUnited States.\nApplicant traveled to Cuba three times after she immigrated to the United States in\n1998. The last trip occurred in June 2004, just a few days after she became a naturalized\nU.S. citizen. She used a Cuban passport on each trip as required by Cuban law. Applicant\nrenewed her Cuban passport in March 2004, for use on future trips to Cuba. She did not\nobtain a U.S. passport until February 2005. Applicant visited the Dominican Republic in\n2004, and apparently used her Cuban passport for that trip also. Applicant has not returned\nto Cuba since her mother and brother immigrated to the U.S., and she does not have any\nplans on visiting Cuba in the future. \nPossession and use of a foreign passport constitute the exercise of a right of foreign\ncitizenship. However, although Applicant still possessed the Cuban passport at the time\nof the hearing, she subsequently surrendered it to her employer\u2019s FSO. The FSO has\nagreed on behalf of the employer to retain possession of the passport and notify DOHA\nimmediately if the passport is returned to Applicant. \nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 10(a): exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of\nforeign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\n\n7\nfamily member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign\npassport applied at the time of the hearing. Since Applicant has now surrendered the\npassport to her employer\u2019s FSO, she is entitled to application of Mitigating Condition (MC)\n11(e): the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority,\nor otherwise invalidated. Additionally, she credibly testified she has no future plans on\nvisiting Cuba now that her mother and brother have immigrated to the United States.\nConsidering all available information, Guideline C is decided for me.    \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as\nwhether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nApplicant\u2019s maternal grandmother, step-father, and more distant relatives such as\naunts and uncles are citizens and residents of Cuba. Her mother and brother remain\ncitizens of Cuba. Applicant\u2019s mother contacts the maternal grandmother by telephone on\na regular basis and sends her relatively small amounts of money on occasion. Applicant\u2019s\nbrother contacts his father, Applicant\u2019s step-father, by telephone on a regular basis.\nApplicant speaks with her grandmother and step-father when she is present when they are\ncontacted. Applicant visited with her Cuban relatives when she traveled there after\nimmigrating to the United States. Although Applicant has no plans to travel to Cuba in the\nfuture, it is probable her mother and brother will find it necessary to go there as their\nrespective Cuban relatives age. \nCuba under the Castro regime has been a totalitarian police state with a lengthy\nhistory of human rights abuses almost since the day he took power. It has an almost 50-\nyear history of anti-Americanism that has manifested itself in many ways, including\nintensive espionage activities, sometimes lethally successful, to infiltrate American\norganizations and gain sensitive information to be used to the detriment of the United\nStates. The numerous documents submitted for administrative notice by Department\nCounsel provide every reason to believe the Castro regime would exploit any person,\nincluding Cuban citizens and residents, through acts of violence and otherwise in an effort\nto gain information that might be used against American interests. Applicant\u2019s relatives in\nCuba, and she and her relatives in the United States through them, are potential targets\nof that exploitation because of their continuing inter-personal relationships. Applicant\u2019s past\ntravel to Cuba does not create any continuing security concern. \nDC 7(a): contact with a foreign family member . . . or other person who is a citizen\nof or resident in a foreign country it that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and DC 7(d): sharing living\nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion apply.\n\n8\nI have considered all mitigating conditions and find that none apply. Specifically, MC\n8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located . . . are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position\nof having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual . . . and the interests of\nthe U.S. does not apply because of the obvious close relationship between Applicant and\nher mother and brother, and their equally obvious close relationship with their respective\nparents in Cuba, and the nature and history of the Castro regime. Likewise, MC 8(b): there\nis no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person . . . is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. does not apply for these same reasons along with\nthe relatively short time her mother and brother have been in the United States and the fact\nher brother has yet to gain permanent resident status.   \nAlthough Applicant has minimal contact with her relatives in Cuba, she resides with\nher mother and brother who have regular contact with their respective parents in Cuba.\nThe vicarious risk of duress, coercion, or exploitation being exerted against Applicant\nthrough her mother and brother continues to exist and negates application of MC 8(c):\ncontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d In this case, there is absolutely no reason to doubt that Applicant is a loyal\nAmerican citizen or suspect she would ever consider doing harm to the interests of the\nUnited States. Likewise, there is no reason to suspect that her mother or brother would do\nanything to harm the interests of the United States. Still, their continuing contacts with\nCuba through their remaining relatives in that country, coupled with the nature and history\nof the Castro regime, create a security concern that has not been overcome.    \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the foreign influence\nsecurity concern that exists in this case. She has failed to overcome the case against her\nin this regard or satisfy her ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline B is decided against\nApplicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

CREAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRobert E. Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a painter for a defense contractor.  His debts were discharged by Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in 1991, and again in 2001.  He now has a debt of $47,000 from the repossession of his\nsecond house that he has not paid or made any attempts to resolve.  He has not provided information\nto mitigate security concerns raised by his irresponsible actions concerning his finances.  Clearance\nis denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\n\nItem 4.\n1\nItems 3, 4, and 6.\n2\n2\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), using the\nAdjudicative Guidelines promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented by\nthe Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on\nJuly 25, 2007.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), of\nthe Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 30, 2007.  He admitted the factual allegations\nin the SOR but denied the security concern raised under Guideline F.  He provided an explanation\nfor his financial problems.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a\nhearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on August 23, 2007.\nApplicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on September 5, 2007, and was\nprovided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ndisqualifying conditions.  His response was due October 5, 2007.  As of November 1, 2007, he had\nnot responded.  The case was assigned to me on November 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nI thoroughly and carefully reviewed the case file and the pleadings.  I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is 46 years old and a painter for a defense contractor.  He was married for over 19\nyears before his first wife died of cancer.  There were two children from this marriage.  He married\nagain six years ago and has two step-children.  He served in the Army for ten years and held a\nsecurity clearance during that time.  He also held a security clearance while working for other\ndefense contractors.  He submitted a security clearance application for his present position with the\ndefense contractor on October 26, 2005.1\nApplicant and his first wife filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 1991.  His first wife was\ndiagnosed with terminal cancer.  They had expensive medical bills and his wife used their credit\ncards to buy an exceptional number of non-medical items.  The bankruptcy was filed because they\nwere not able to pay the medical or credit card bills.  Their debts were discharged in October 1991.\nHis first wife passed away in March 1996.2\nApplicant filed a second Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2002, and his debts were\ndischarged in May 2002.  Applicant had been employed for over 18 years at the same defense\ncontractor firm and was making a good salary.  His company was purchased by another company and\nhe was laid off.  He secured other employment but at a salary about half of his prior salary.  He could\n\nItems 3 and 7.\n3\nItem 5.\n4\nItems 6 and 8.\n5\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The second house is a mobile home that he lived in which had\na mortgage.  When Applicant was laid off, this house was repossessed by the mortgage company\nwhen he was unable to pay the mortgage because of his decreased salary.  There is a remainder debt\nof over $47,000, from the repossession that Applicant has not paid or made any arrangements with\nthe mortgage company to pay.  Applicant now lives in the original house.4\nApplicant\u2019s monthly income is $1,900, with monthly expenses of $1,260, leaving a remainder\nof $690 monthly .  He has $4,200 in savings, and owns a car, motorcycle, and boat.  He lists his\nassets as $89,000.  There are no other delinquent accounts listed on his credit report.5\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   Eligibility for a security clearance is\n6\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.7\nAdjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and\nthe disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each guideline are set forth in the AG\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense\non September 1, 2006.  Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, and the whole person concept.8\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of\n\nId.\n9\nSee Exec.

The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n10\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.11\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n12\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n13\npresent evidence to disprove any adjudicative guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n14\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n15\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d16\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\n\nAG \u00b6 18.\n17\n5\nA security concern exists because a failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.   \n17\nThe cause of debts and action taken or not taken to pay debts are a better indicator of a person\u2019s\nreliability or trustworthiness and judgment than the amount of debt.  An individual who is financially\nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect\nclassified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an\nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  Irresponsibility towards financial\nobligations may be indicated by failure to take reasonable measures to pay or reduce debts.  A person\u2019s\nrelationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability\nor unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or\nmitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in\na situation of risk inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An applicant is not required\nto be debt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial\nobligations.  \nApplicant filed two bankruptcy actions and then had his second home repossessed.  He has\ntaken no steps to pay the $47,000 owed on the repossessed home.  His bankruptcy actions and his\nfailure to act on the repossession debt brings the matter within Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nConditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (A history\nof not meeting financial obligations).  Since Applicant admits the bankruptcies, the repossession, and\nthat he has taken no action to resolve this debt, I conclude the above disqualifying conditions have\nbeen established.\nAppellant\u2019s answer to the SOR raises a number of Financial Consideration Mitigating\nConditions (FC MC).  Applicant\u2019s first wife had expensive medical treatment for her cancer and ran\nup credit debts resulting in the first bankruptcy filing.  The second bankruptcy was caused by Applicant\nbeing laid off from a good paying job requiring him to take a lesser paying job.  These conditions raise\nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  His wife\u2019s\nillness and spending habits as well as his loss of employment were beyond his control.  However,\nApplicant present no information to show that under the circumstances he acted reasonably.  There is\nno indication of what actions, if any, he took or could have taken to control his debts to live within his\nmeans on a reduced salary.  While this mitigating condition applies, I give it only partial weight.  \nApplicant has no delinquent debt other than the debt owed on the mobile home that was\nrepossessed.  His credit report shows he pays bills as agreed.  His monthly salary and expenses shows\nhe has a remainder sufficient to pay his debts.  He is not now financially overextended.  These\ncircumstances raises FC MC 20(d) (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts).  He is paying his creditors and has resolved his debt other than\nthe debt owed on the home repossession, so he receives some mitigating credit for his efforts to pay\n\n6\ncreditors. \nApplicant still has an unresolved debt on the home repossession.  FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (The behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgement) is not raised since the debt is still owed and current and failure to take action on the debt\ndoes cast doubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.\nBankruptcy is a legal and permissible means of paying and resolving debt.  However, the\ncircumstances leading up to the bankruptcy action and the actions of Applicant after debts are\ndischarged should be examined to determine if Applicant acted reasonably and responsibly in regard\nto his finances.  Applicant\u2019s first bankruptcy was caused by medical bills from his wife\u2019s illness and\nher spending habits.  The second bankruptcy was filed after he lost lucrative employment and then\nworked at a reduced salary.  The fact that he filed bankruptcy under the circumstances does not show\nhe was irresponsible towards his finances, and he has mitigated security concerns based on the\nbankruptcies.  Thereafter, his second home was repossessed and he still has a debt to the mortgage\ncompany of over $47,000.  He has taken no steps to resolve this debt.  He has sufficient income to\nmake payments on the debt.  He has sufficient assets he can use to generate funds to use to pay the\ndebt.  He has not presented any information on steps taken to resolve the debt or why he cannot resolve\nit.  This information does show that he is irresponsible in regard to his finances.\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I\nconclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.  Applicant has shown an\nirresponsible attitude toward his debts.  He presented insufficient information to explain why he cannot\npay or resolve the debt.  He has failed to carry his burden to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ndisqualifying conditions.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns for financial\nconsiderations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information.\nClearance is denied.\n\n7\nThomas M.

Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on October 7, 2005. On October 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence) and C (Foreign Preference). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 5, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 29, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR on \nDecember 7, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on December 19, \n2007, and I received the case assignment on December 24, 2007. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on January 16, 2008, scheduling the case for February 14, 2008. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, \nwhich were received without objection, and testified on his own behalf. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 27, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR correcting the case number from \n06-02712 to 07-02712. Without objection from the Applicant, I granted Department \nCounsel\u2019s motion. Tr. 9-11. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a Request for Administrative Notice (Exhibit (Ex.) \nI(A)), requesting that I take administrative notice of the summary of facts contained in \nEx. I(A) as well as those facts in Exs. I through X. Without objection from Applicant, I \ntook administrative notice of the documents offered by Department Counsel, which \npertained to Iran. (Tr. 24-26).  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to \nIran were derived from Exs. I(A), and I through X as contained infra under the \nsubheading \u201cIran\u201d of this decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                     \nApplicant is a 48-year-old owner of a company in which he serves as president \nand chief executive officer. He describes himself as a \u201cfire protection expert\u201d and \u201cthe \none that actually determines what needs to be done to make the construction safe and \nprepare all of the life safety measures and fire protection measures\u201d as it pertains to \nsprinklers and fire alarms. Tr. 34-35, 47-48, 133. He is a first time Applicant for a \nsecurity clearance and if granted a clearance he would have greater access to secure \nGovernment job sites in which his company provides services. Tr. 48-50,161-165.  \n \nApplicant was born in December 1959 in Iran, where he was raised, and \neducated. GE 1, Tr. 37-38. His father was a career Air Force officer and served in the \nIranian Air Force from 1949 to 1979. Tr. 38-40. In approximately 1978, Applicant\u2019s \nfather was assigned to a military base in the U.S. Tr. 129-130. Applicant along with his \nmother and one of his sisters accompanied his father to the U.S., leaving the other \nsister behind in Iran.  \n \nIn approximately 1980 following the overthrow of the Shah of Iran in 1979, \nApplicant\u2019s father was expelled from the U.S. after the U.S. broke diplomatic relations \nwith Iran in April 1980.1 Applicant, his mother and sister remained in the U.S. and took \nup permanent residence. After Applicant\u2019s father returned to Iran, he retired from the Air \nForce, and in approximately 1982, he returned to the U.S. reuniting with his family. He \nthen took up permanent residence in the U.S. Applicant\u2019s father does not receive a \nmilitary retirement from the Iranian government as a result of residing in the U.S. Tr. 37-\n41, 132-133. \n \nShortly after Applicant arrived in the U.S., he enrolled in a two year college where \nhe studied the English language. He later transferred to a prestigious university where \nhe was awarded a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering in May 1982. \nFrom approximately May 1982 to May 1985, he was enrolled in a joint master\u2019s/Ph.D. \nprogram in mechanical engineering at the same university. He completed all of his \ncourse work for those degrees and completed his thesis, but did not receive his degrees \nbecause he did not present or defend his thesis. GE 1, Tr. 45-47, 130-131. \n \nApplicant is not married and does not have any dependents. He was previously \nmarried two times. His second marriage was from May 2000 to January 2003, and his \nfirst marriage was from April 1993 to August 1994. Both of his former wives were Iranian \nborn and both marriages ended by divorce. Applicant does not maintain contact with \neither of his former spouses. GE 1, Tr. 50. \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in August 1995, and was issued a U.S. passport \nin March 1997. He renewed his U.S. passport in February 2007. The only valid passport \nhe holds is his U.S. passport. GE 1, Tr. 51-54. In order to travel to Iran, Applicant \napplied for an Iranian passport, which was issued to him in February 1998 and expired \nin February 2003. He does not intend to visit Iran again and nor does he have any \nintention on renewing his Iranian passport. GE 2, Tr. 51-52. Applicant holds dual \n \n1 For further information, see AE I (Background Note: Iran, U.S. Department of State, Bureau of \nNear Eastern Affairs, dated June 2007). \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncitizenship with the U.S. and Iran by operation of Iranian law. He expressed a \nwillingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship and stands ready to do so if requested or \nrequired. GE 4. \n \nApplicant \nhas \nfour \nimmediate \nfamily \nmembers. \nTheir \nrelationship \nto \nApplicant/brief description follows: \n \nFather. He was born March 1933 in Iran, and is now 75. He served in the Iranian \nAir Force as an officer from 1949-1979 until he retired. He has lived in the U.S. \ncontinuously since 1978 except for a brief period from 1980 to 1982, discussed supra. \nHe currently holds U.S. permanent resident alien status (green card) issued in August \n1986. Applicant stated his father plans on applying for U.S. citizenship. His Iranian \npassport expired in February 2008. When Applicant\u2019s father returned to the U.S. in \n1982, he owned his own jewelry store pursuing his \u201chobby\u201d as a master jeweler and \nwatch maker. His father is now retired and owns several rental properties and lives off \nhis investments. GE 1, GE 2, Tr. 38-42, 132-135. \n \nMother. She was born August 1936 in Iran, and is now 72. She is a career \nhousewife. She has lived in the U.S. continuously since 1978. She became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in August 1997, and was issued a U.S. passport in October \n2007. She held an Iranian passport, which expired in April 2008. GE 1, GE 2. \n \nSister. She was born May 1955 in Iran, and is now 53. She is a career \nhousewife. She lives in Iran with her husband, who is a certified public accountant, and \nretired from an Iranian government agency. Since retiring, he has been working for a \nprivate firm. Applicant\u2019s sister and her husband applied for and received their green \ncards in January 2008. They plan to move to the U.S. as soon as they make the \nnecessary preparations. Applicant stated, \u201cI\u2019m guessing it\u2019s going to take them about a \nyear to make the final move.\u201d For now, Applicant\u2019s sister and her husband remain in \nIran. Applicant\u2019s sister and her husband have three adult sons in their early 20s, who \nalso plan to move to the U.S. and will do so when they complete the required paperwork \nto immigrate to the U.S. Applicant testified his sister calls him \u201c[p]robably twice a year \nmaybe.\u201d Applicant\u2019s mother and sister \u2018are in much more frequent contact.\u201d GE 1, Tr. \n121-123, 135-140. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) Neither Applicant\u2019s sister nor her husband are \nassociated or connected with the Iranian government. GE 4. \n \nSister. She was born August 1964 in Iran, and is now 44. She is employed as a \ncomputer analyst for a private firm. She has lived in the U.S. continuously since 1978. \nShe became a naturalized U.S. citizen in February 1996. She is on her second \nmarriage, and has one son from her first marriage. Her first husband and her current \nhusband are from Iran, and both now live in the U.S. Her husband is a general \ncontractor. Tr. 107-112. \n \nSince moving to the U.S. in 1978, Applicant has visited Iran on three occasions. \nIn March 1998, Applicant traveled to Iran and stayed four months for the purpose of \nvisiting his 53-year-old sister. In May 1999, Applicant visited Iran for about two weeks \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \nfor the purpose of attending the wedding ceremony for his second marriage. In October \n1999, Applicant and his then second wife visited Iran for ten days to attend his former \nfather-in-law\u2019s funeral. Applicant used his Iranian passport on all three occasions to \nenter and exit Iran. GE 4. \n \nApplicant stated his loyalties are with the U.S., that he considers himself to be a \nloyal U.S. citizen, and that if he were approached by anyone soliciting classified \ninformation from him, he would report such an overture to proper authority. He does not \nhave any foreign contact with any foreign national other than his sister in Iran. Tr. 118-\n123. He has worked at approximately seven U.S. embassies and various military \ninstallations in the U.S. and abroad. Tr. 34-36. All of Applicant\u2019s assets are U.S.-based, \nwhich include his home, office building, several automobiles, and his retirement \naccount. He estimates his net worth to be at $4 million. He belongs to three professional \nengineering-related organizations. Tr. 141-144. \n \nApplicant received three solid recommendations from business colleagues. \nIncluded in their letters or statements are that Applicant is \u201cvery loyal and an asset to \nthis country,\u201d that Applicant is a \u201cgreat example of a hardworking individual living the \nAmerican dream,\u201d and Applicant is \u201cof the highest moral character and [is] a dedicated \ncitizen of the United States of America.\u201d All of Applicants references describe him as \ntrustworthy and recommend him for a clearance. AE A \u2013 C. \n \nIran2 \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Iran is a \u201ctheocratic Islamic \nrepublic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures.\u201d Iran engages \nin clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD) in defiance of the International community, sponsors international \nterrorism, intervenes in the internal affairs of Iraq, is arming terrorists in Iraq, \nundermines the Middle East peace process, and violates the human rights of the Iranian \npeople. The United States and its allies are attempting to block Iran\u2019s goals of obtaining \nnuclear weapons and other WMD and to counter Iran\u2019s efforts to destabilize Iraq and \nother the Middle East countries.  \n \nIran is one of the most active state sponsors of terrorism. The United States is \nconcerned about the possibility that terrorists could eventually obtain WMD from Iran. \nIran supports terrorists who attack Israel and Shiite militias who pursue sectarian \nviolence in Iraq. Iranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens, should carefully consider the \nrisks of travel in Iran because they are still considered Iranian citizens by Iranian \nauthorities. The Iranian government has harassed and detained dual citizens of the \nUnited States and Iran. \n \n \n \n \n2 The contents of the Iran section are taken in whole or in part from Exs. I through X. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                     \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.3 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d4 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n4  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                     \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 6, the Government\u2019s concern is:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.5 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \n \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with his sister. His 53-year-old sister, her \nhusband, and their three children are resident citizens of Iran. His parents and 44-year-\nold sister and her family live near the Applicant and see each other frequently. \nApplicant\u2019s close relationship with his sister in Iran is shown by his frequent telephone \ncontacts with her either directly or vicariously through his immediate family members in \nthe U.S. Although Applicant\u2019s sister and her husband plan to immigrate to the U.S., they \nhave not done so. Applicant and his family can fairly be described as a close family. \nApplicant also took the time off from work and incurred the expense to visit his sister in \nIran for four months in 1998. These contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation because there is always the possibility that Iranian agents or \nterrorists may exploit the opportunity to obtain information about the United States. His \nconnection to his family members also creates a potential conflict of interest because \nhis relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire to \nhelp them by providing sensitive or classified information.  \n \nThese close relationships create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation because Iran and the United States\u2019 relationship is far from \nfriendly. His connections to his Iranian family also create a potential conflict of interest \nbecause his relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his \ndesire to help his family by providing sensitive information. Applicant\u2019s relationship with \nhis sister creates this \u201cheightened risk\u201d because of his contact, direct and vicarious, with \nhis sister in Iran. Applicant\u2019s sister and her husband are in the process settling their \naffairs in Iran before moving to the U.S., which has yet to occur. \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                     \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that only mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies.  \n \nApplicant has not traveled to Iran since 1999, and he became a U.S. naturalized \ncitizen in 1995. AG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient \nrelationship and loyalty to the United States, that he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States\u2019 interests. He has lived in the United \nStates for approximately 30 years. He is a naturalized U.S. citizen and all of his financial \nand business interests are in the United States. Applicant has established himself as an \nAmerican citizen and a successful businessman. He has a track record of diligent labor \nin the development of his company. Although this mitigating condition is partially \napplicable, it is insufficient to overcome the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nHe has contacts and close relationships with his parents and sister living in the \nUnited States, and they all have contacts and a close relationship with his sister in Iran. \nIn particular, Applicant\u2019s 44-year-old sister and mother stay in close contact with his 53-\nyear-old sister living in Iran.  \n \nGuideline \u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply. Applicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely \n[he] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of [his Iranian \nfamily] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d His frequent contacts and close relationships with \nhis sister in Iran could potentially force him to choose between the United States and \nIran. He did not meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his \nrelationships with his Iranian family members] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d   \n \nThe nature of Iran\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its \nhuman rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. The hostility of Iran \nto the United States places a \u201cvery heavy burden of persuasion\u201d on Applicant to \ndemonstrate that his immediate family members in Iran (visiting or living in Iran) do not \npose a security risk and he will not be placed into a position to be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and his Iranian family members.6 With its \nadversarial stance and its negative human rights record, it is likely that Iran would target \n \n6 See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating an applicant has \u201ca very \nheavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when parents and siblings live in Iran).  \nSee also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nstandard when an applicant has family members living in Iran).   \n\n \n10 \n \n \nany citizen in an attempt to gather classified or sensitive information from the United \nStates. \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister and her husband and are in the process of moving to the U.S. \nHis sister\u2019s three children also plan to move to the U.S. at some point in the future. \nWhen that occurs, most if not all of the concerns identified in Applicant\u2019s case, will be \nalleviated. In the interim, the potential for exploitation and coercion remains. On the \nother hand, there is no evidence that his sister or husband and children work for the \nIranian government or military or any news media. There is no evidence that the Iranian \ngovernment has approached any of his Iranian family for any reason, and in particular, \nhas not approached them recently about Applicant. There is no evidence that his family \nliving in Iran currently engages in activities which would bring attention to themselves or \nthat they are even aware of her work.  \n \nNotwithstanding, Foreign Influence mitigating conditions cannot be applied in this \ncase, and the security concerns cannot be fully mitigated because there is no reason for \nIran to contact his relatives about Applicant until he receives access to classified \ninformation. Even taking for granted that his Iranian family members currently have low-\nkey non-controversial lifestyles, and that the Iranian government has not contacted \nthem about Applicant in the past, such factors are insufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns because of the nature of the Iranian government and its relationship to the \nUnited States. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 9, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 sets out one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport. \n \n \nApplicant applied for an Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen in order to \nvisit Iran. He did so because Iran would not recognize his U.S. passport. He was issued \nhis Iranian passport in February 1998 and it expired in February 2003. He has not \nrenewed nor does he intend to renew his Iranian passport.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nThree Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 11 are potentially \nmitigating to this disqualifying condition: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and  \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nAlthough dual citizenship was not alleged, the subject of Applicant\u2019s dual \ncitizenship was developed during the Government\u2019s cross-examination. Such dual \ncitizenship was derived from his birth to Iranian parents in Iran. He expressed an \nunconditional willingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship. Applicant last used his \nIranian passport in 1999, approximately nine years ago. Applicant\u2019s Iranian passport \nhas long since expired and he has no interest or desire in renewing it. This concern is \ndeemed mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a), 11(b), and 11(e). \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant strongly averred his loyalty to the United States, that he considers \nhimself to be an American, and his desire to continue his work on U.S. government \nfacilities here and abroad. Applicant has lived in the U.S. for 30 years and has been a \nnaturalized citizen for 14 years. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance to \nthe United States. His 44-year-old sister and his mother are also a U.S. citizens, and \nlive in the U.S. His father is a U.S. permanent resident.  \n\n \n12 \n \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant travelled to Iran on three separate occasions in March \n1998, May 1999, and October 1999. He has an immediate family member, a sister, who \nat least for now, is a resident citizen of Iran. Applicant and his family enjoy a close \nrelationship and look forward to being united as a family in the U.S. Applicant has strong \nties of affection and or obligation to his parents and sisters, including the one in Iran. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s sister and her family live in Iran, they are vulnerable to coercion or \nexploitation by Iran. Applicant\u2019s statement about his loyalty to the United States is \ncredible, and there is no reason to believe that he would take any action which could \ncause potential harm to his U.S. family or to this country.  \n \nThere is no evidence he has ever taken any action which could cause potential \nharm to the United States, or that he lacks honesty and integrity. He credibly stated that \nhe takes his loyalty to the United States very seriously. He has the respect and trust of \nhis business colleagues. There is no evidence that he has revealed to his family in Iran \nthe nature of his work or about applying for a security clearance.   \n \n \nNumerous circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. \nIran is seeking WMD and Iran\u2019s government is currently in an adversarial position with \nrespect to the United States. More importantly for security purposes, Iran seeks \nsensitive or protected U.S. information. Applicant spent the first 18 years of his life in \nIran, which can arguably be referred to as his formative years. He was born in Iran and \nreceived his pre-college education in Iran. He has family members who are Iranian \ncitizens living in Iran, and his parents remain in touch with Applicant\u2019s sister and their \nrelatives living in Iran. Applicant has frequent and non-casual direct and vicarious \ncontact with his sister living in Iran. These contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation because there is always the possibility that Iranian agents or \nterrorists may attempt to use Applicant\u2019s family members living in Iran to obtain \ninformation about the United States.  \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990).  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference. The evidence leaves me with doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability. However, at such time as Applicant\u2019s \nimmediate family members currently living in Iran do successfully immigrate to the U.S., \nthe security concerns identified in this decision may well be alleviated. \n \nFor reasons discussed supra, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the \nconcerns arising from his foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph1.a.:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 11, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Darlene Lokey-Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because it was not based on\nsubstantial evidence.  \n1\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is \u201cfar removed from any realistic appreciation\nof the facts as to constitute an abuse of her discretion.\u201d He disputes that he is vulnerable to influences\nof Iran that are inimical to the national interests of the United States just because his family members\n(father and sisters) live in and are citizens of Iran.  In support of that contention, Applicant argues,\namong other things, that over the past 30 years he has developed solid roots in, and loyalty to, the\nUnited States, which far outweigh his weak, intermittent, and diminishing ties to family in Iran.\nApplicant has been an American citizen since 1988, and except for four trips outside the United\nStates, has, at all times, remained in the United States.  One trip was a business trip to a third\ncountry, and the three other trips were to Iran (in 1982, 2002-2003, and 2005-2006).  The 1982 trip\nwas intended to introduce his former wife and daughter to his family, and the other two were\noccasioned by his mother\u2019s death and his father\u2019s health. His two children, born of an American\nmother, have no connection to Iran, and his brother lives in the United States.  Applicant argues that\nhis relationship with his father and sisters in Iran is not \u201cclose and continuing\u201d as the Judge had\nconcluded, but merely exhibits the \u201cminimal amenities and kindnesses\u201d that most Americans exhibit\nin their own family relations.  Finally, he argues that he has a \u201cspotless\u201d record as an employee\nhandling classified materials for his employer, and he has demonstrated that he adheres to security\nrequirements, is dedicated, and is an employee of integrity.   \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\n\n3\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-09542 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  A review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates\nthat the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the\ndisqualifying circumstances, and considered possible application of relevant mitigating conditions\nand factors.  The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor with regard to the allegations under Guideline C,\nbut reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline B.  The Judge articulated a reasonable\nconcern that Applicant\u2019s circumstances created a conflict of interest that could potentially make him\nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure. \nBased on the record evidence, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that there is \u201cevidence of a close bond\nand strong evidence of affection\u201d between Applicant and his family in Iran is sustainable.  Decision\nat 8.  Reviewing the evidence as a whole, it was reasonable for her to also conclude that none of the\nmitigating conditions in Guideline B apply.  Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty to the family members in\nIran is not minimal, and his contacts are not casual.  Directive E2.8.  The government\u2019s  security\nconcern is based on close family ties in Iran, considered in the context of the overall political/security\nprofile of that country vis-a-vis the United States.  The Judge also specifically considered\nApplicant\u2019s evidence of a commendable workplace performance, integrity, and adherence to security\nrequirements, but workplace performance may not overcome the security concerns caused by his\nfamily circumstances.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-04371 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2007). The\nJudge\u2019s decision exhibits a discerning weighing of a number of variables to reach a commonsense\ndetermination.  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08116 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007). The\nJudge has articulated a rational explanation for her unfavorable determination under the disqualifying\nand mitigating factors and the whole-person concept, and there is sufficient record evidence to\nsupport that determination\u2014given the standard that required the Judge to err on the side of national\nsecurity.

He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nThe Applicant was born in Iran in 1954 to Iranian parents.  He grew up in Iran\nand came to the United States in 1978, on a student visa to attend college.  A year later,\nin 1979, he married a United States citizen, received a green card, and started the\nnaturalization process.  In August 1988, he became a naturalized United States citizen.\nBefore they divorced in 1989, the Applicant and his wife had two children who were\nborn in the United States.    \nSince moving to the United States in 1979, the Applicant has traveled to Iran on\nthree separate occasions.  In 1982, prior to becoming a United States citizen, he\ntraveled to Iran with his wife and daughter to introduce them to his family there.  On that\noccasion, he used his original Iranian passport that he came to the United States with to\nenter and exit Iran.  The Applicant applied for and was issued an Iranian passport in\nAugust 2002, after becoming a naturalized United States citizen in August 1988.  The\nApplicant later applied for and obtained a United States passport in 2003.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 5).  Instead of using his United States passport, the Applicant used\n\n3\nhis Iranian passport to enter and exit Iran when he traveled to Iran from December 15,\n2002 through January 2003, when his mother died, and from December 17, 2005\nthrough January 2006, when his father had heart surgery.  (See Government Exhibit 4).\nWhen asked why he did not use his United States passport, or get a visa to travel to\nIran instead, the Applicant stated that he had some fear of traveling to Iran on the\nUnited States passport.  He has less fear traveling on an Iranian passport.  (Tr. p. 60).   \n      \nAlthough his Iranian passport expired in August 2007, the Applicant currently\nmaintains it in his file cabinet.  (Tr. p. 61).  If his father passes away, he would like to\ntravel to Iran to pay respect.  He states, however, that he would not renew his Iranian\npassport, but instead he would look into how to get to Iran by using his United States\npassport.  (Tr. p. 65).  He also stated that he would renounce his Iranian citizenship if it\nis required.  However, he has not investigated the process of renouncing his Iranian\ncitizenship.  (Tr. p. 63). \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant\u2019s father and six sisters are citizens and residents of Iran.  His\nsisters have children who are citizens and reside in Iran.  The Applicant contacts his\nfamily in Iran on a regular basis to stay abreast of information concerning his father\u2019s\nhealth and how the whole family is doing in general.  He contacts his sister who lives\nwith his father about once every three or four weeks.  (Tr. pp. 49 and 54).  He speaks to\nhis father about once every six months.  (Tr. p. 66).  In regard to his other sisters, he\ncontacts one or two of them about once a year by telephone and one of them by e-mail\non various occasions.  (Tr. pp. 54, and 66-67).  Their attempts to contact him varies.\nOne of his sisters contacts him by e-mail about once a month, sometimes once every\nsix months, as it varies, to discuss family matters and to ask about the children.  (Tr. P.\n72-73).  He recently sent photos by e-mail of his daughter\u2019s graduation to one of his\nsisters.  (Tr. p. 67).  \nExcept for a sister who is a public school principal in Iran, none of the Applicant\u2019s\nfamily in Iran are employed for or agents of the Iranian government.  His father is 79\nyears old and sells fishing equipment.  One of his sisters is unemployed and is\nfinancially supported by their father.  Another one of his sisters owns a rope making\nfactory, and three are housewives supported by their husbands.  None of the sister\u2019s\nhusbands work for the Iranian government.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s brother resides in the United States and is here on a student\nvisa. He is working as an engineer and is aware that the Applicant is applying for a\nsecurity clearance.  The Applicant\u2019s brother finished his two years compulsory military\nservice in Iran before coming to the United States.         \n\n4\nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in Iran.  The\nfact that Iran has no diplomatic relations with the United States, Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire\nnuclear weapons and other weapon of mass destruction, its support for and involvement\nin international terrorism, it\u2019s support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace\nprocess, and it\u2019s dismal human rights records.  I have considered the fact that Iranian\nGovernment officials at all levels commit serious abuses of their power and authority.\nIt\u2019s Totalitarian Government and the level of insurgent troops there, the fact that Iran\nhas terrorists activities, and is rampant with crime and instability.  The overall\ndeteriorating security situation in Iran, the human rights abuses, and the government\ncorruption elevates the cause for concern in the case.  The United States may face no\ngreater challenge from a single country than from Iran.    \nThe Applicant\u2019s section head and supervisor who hired the Applicant, has regular\ncontact with him at work, and who evaluates his work performance, testified that the\nApplicant\u2019s work performance is of high quality, as evidenced by his early promotion,\nwhich is unprecedented.  With regard to his character, the Applicant is considered to be\nextremely dependable, honest, maintains a high level of integrity and is a loyal citizen of\nthe United States.  The Applicant has never been seen to fail to carry out necessary\nprecautions or procedures related to security.  The Applicant\u2019s Section head knows\nnothing about the Applicant\u2019s family in Iran and has only socialized with him at work\nfunctions. \nA letter of recommendation from a co-worker who has worked with the Applicant\nfor two years attests to his great character and high integrity.  He considers the\nApplicant to be loyal, honest, dedicated to his job and family and one of the most\ngenuine people he has ever known.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  \n      \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\n\n5\nForeign Preference\n9.  The Concern.  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for\na foreign country over the United States, then he or he may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n10.  (a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n11.  (a) dual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry;\n11.  (b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n11.  (e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\n\n6\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference),\nand Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment,\n\n7\nreliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown\nbetween Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified\ninformation, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or\ndirect evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign\nconnections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to\nthe interests of the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises\nlegitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the\ninterests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The Government\nmust be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to\nabide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Preference, Disqualifying Condition 10(a) exercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member applies.  However, Mitigation Conditions 11(a)\ndual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign country, 11(b)\nthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship, and 11(e) the\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated also apply.\nThe Applicant is a dual citizen of Iran and the United States.  It is noted that the\nApplicant came to the United States as a teenager, and that he has worked for more\nthan 30 years in the United States.  He has two children who are native born American\ncitizens and are educated and successful.  However, after becoming a United States\ncitizen in August 1988, and after having applied for and obtained a United States\npassport in August 2003, the Applicant used his Iranian passport to enter and exit Iran\nfrom December 15, 2002, through January 2003 and from December 17, 2005, through\nJanuary 2006.  As he indicated, he felt less fear to use his Iranian passport than if he\nused his United States passport to enter and exit Iran.  Although his Iranian passport\nhas now expired, he has not thrown it away, surrendered it, or destroyed it.  Instead, he\nmaintains it in his file cabinet.  He indicates that he will not renew it, but when he wants\n\n8\nto travel to Iran in the future, he will inquire as to how he can use his United States\npassport.   \nThe Applicant has also indicated that he is willing to renounce his Iranian\ncitizenship if required to do so by DoD, yet he has not done so.  He has not even taken\nthe time to investigate the matter and figure out how to do it.  However, this, under the\ncircumstances of this case, I find for the Applicant under Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference). \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risks of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  None of\nthe mitigation conditions apply. \nIt is also acknowledged that the Applicant has a brother who resides in the\nUnited States.  On the other hand, the Applicant has many family members, including\nhis father and six sisters, who are citizens of and reside in Iran with whom he maintains\na close and continuing relationship. He also has extended family members, including\nnieces and nephews, who reside in Iran.  He is very close to his father and six sisters in\nIran and has regular ongoing contact with them by telephone and e-mail.  Except for his\nsister who is a public school principal, there is no evidence that any of his family\nmembers in Iran are associated in any way with the Iranian government.  There is,\nhowever, evidence of a close bond and strong evidence of affection with his immediate\nfamily.  This bond and affection with his family could potentially cause the Applicant to\nbecome subject to foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nMoreover, the current political situation in Iran elevates the cause for concern in this\ncase.  The possibility of foreign influence exists that could create the potential for\nconduct resulting in the compromise of classified information.  I find that the Applicant is\nvulnerable to foreign influence.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline\nB (Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.\nGuideline C is found for the Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\n\n9\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n2.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n2.b.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n2.c.: Against the Applicant\n \n \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Coale, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 9 April 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF.  Applicant answered the SOR 4 May 2009, and requested a decision without hearing.\n1\nDOHA assigned the case to me 3 September 2009. The record in this case closed 10\nJuly 2009, the day Applicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) was due. Applicant provided no additional information for evaluation.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations. He is a 42-year-old facilities\nmanager employed by a U.S. defense contractor since May 1985. He appears to have\nOctober 2, 2009\n\n2\nheld a clearance, as needed, since August 1993. He has been married since August\n1981, and has three children.\nThe SOR alleges, Applicant admits, and government exhibits substantiate, 13\ndelinquent debts totaling over $24,000. The debts consist of state and federal income\ntaxes (SOR 1.a.\u2013c.) and credit card debt (SOR 1.d.\u2013m.). Applicant attributes his\nfinancial problems to his wife\u2019s 6-8 months unemployment in 2000-2001 and a job\nrelocation in September 2005. However, an underlying cause of his financial problems\nis the large number of credit cards on which he and his wife maintained balances.\n  \nApplicant claims to have repayment plans on his delinquent taxes. However, his\ndocumentation shows only one installment payment in August 2008 on his federal\nincome taxes. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has also been seizing his income tax\nrefunds for years in which he has them. Documents concerning his state taxes reflect a\npast due balance for 2004, but also that he has paid his taxes for 2006 (not at issue in\nthis SOR).\nApplicant also claims to have consolidated some of his credit card debt with a\ncredit consolidator, and was to begin monthly payments to the consolidator in August\n2008. However, he has provided no documentation of which debts were consolidated\nand which debts he was to repay directly. He has provided no documentation that he\nhas made the agreed payments to the consolidator. He has provided no documentation\nof any payments to creditors made by him or by the consolidator.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\njudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial commonsense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b619 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n3\n\u00b6 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n4\nit is  unlikely to recur.\n\u00b6 20 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\n\u00b6 20 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n6\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\n\u00b6 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n3\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of\nfinancial difficulties, which are ongoing.  They were largely caused by Applicant\u2019s\n3\nirresponsible use of credit, and exacerbated by his wife\u2019s unemployment and his job\nrelocation.\nApplicant potentially meets only one of the mitigating factors for financial\nconsiderations. His financial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  While his wife\u2019s\n4\nunemployment was clearly a circumstance beyond his control, the seeds of his financial\nproblems had already been sown. Moreover, the unemployment was in 2000-2001 and\nthe job relocation in 2005. Applicant has not acted responsibly in addressing his debts\nsince then, having not even addressed the debts under $1,000.  Also, there is no\n5\nevidence that he has sought credit counseling or otherwise brought the problem under\ncontrol.  There is very little evidence, and no corroboration, of any good-faith effort to\n6\nsatisfy his debts.  Finally, given his unwillingness to seek or use financial counseling,\n7\nthere is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant will put his financial problems\nbehind him. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nAlthough I have reviewed the generally applicable \u201cwhole person\u201d factors, the\nrecord lacks any information upon which to base a favorable analysis.\n\n4\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 40 years old and has been a network technician for a defense contractor for over six years. Applicant served almost four years in the Navy and received an honorable discharge as a Seaman (E-3). He did have some non-judicial punishments while on active duty.

Tillman, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) to update his \nsecurity clearance on April 25, 2006.  The security clearance application was submitted \nbecause Applicant was convicted of a felony offense in January 2006 for an incident \nthat happened in May 2005.  On June 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security \nconcerns for sexual behavior, personal conduct, and criminal conduct under Guidelines \nD, E, and J, respectively.  The security concerns arose out of the same incident from \nMay 2005.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 27, 2008. \n  \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 10, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated response received at DOHA on \nAugust 11, 2008.  Applicant denied all allegations except for the allegation that he is a \nregistered sex offender.  He requested a hearing before an administrative judge.   \n \n \nDepartment Counsel was initially prepared to proceed on August 21, 2008, and a \nnotice of hearing was issued on October 6, 2008, for a hearing on October 21, 2008.  At \nthe hearing under another administrative judge, Applicant did not understand his rights \nto counsel and the hearing was postponed to permit Applicant to obtain counsel.  The \ncase was reassigned to me on November 19, 2008.  Applicant obtained counsel, and a \nnew notice of hearing was issued by DOHA on January 8, 2009, for a hearing on \nFebruary 6, 2009.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered four \nexhibits, marked government exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received \nwithout objection.  Applicant and six witnesses testified on his behalf.  Applicant also \nintroduced six exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through F which were \nadmitted to the record without objection.  Two hearing exhibits, marked Hearing Exhibits \n1 and 2, for the purpose of establishing facts for administrative notice were also \nintroduced by the government and received without objection.  DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 23, 2009.  Based on a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 40 years old and has been a network technician for a defense \ncontractor for over six years.  Applicant served almost four years in the Navy and \nreceived an honorable discharge as a Seaman (E-3).  He did have some non-judicial \npunishments while on active duty.  He returned to the area where he grew up and \nstarted working for a business as an assembly line worker.  He attended and graduated \nfrom technical school as part of the employer's development program and became a \nset-up mechanic.  He worked for that business for 13 years before starting work for the \ndefense contractor.  Applicant has had a security clearance while working for the \ndefense contractor.  He is married with two step-children by his wife from a former \nmarriage and two children of his own.  Only the two youngest children live at home.  \nHowever, he and his wife are now separated and he lives separately from the family (Tr. \n127-130; Gov. Ex. 1, SF 86, dated April 25, 2006; App. Ex. E, Transcript, dated \nDecember 19, 2006; App. Ex. F, Transcript, dated March 19, 1999).   \n \nApplicant's middle school counselor and special education teacher testified that \neven though Applicant had dyslexia and was hyperactive, he had a positive attitude and \nwas eager to learn.  He was pleasant, friendly, and respectful in school.  He was very \nbright with an I.Q of 123 which is in the superior range.  She prepared a letter outlining \nhis need for special education accommodation so he could attend college and technical \nschool (Tr. 21-32; App. Ex. A, Letter, dated June 8, 1999). \n \nIn May 2005, Applicant was at a camp site with family friends including the fifteen \nyear old daughter of a close friend.  While he and the girl were alone, she backed into \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant.  He put his hands on her shoulders and she placed them on her breasts over \nher clothes.  He stated he was surprised by he actions.  He did not stalk the girl prior to \nthe incident.  There was no weapon involved, no threats were made, and no bondage \nwas used.  There was no penetration of the girl and no hands were placed under her \nclothing.  Immediately after the incident, he left the state and drove to a neighboring \nstate to think about the incident and seek guidance from family and friends.  He turned \nhimself into the police in the neighboring state, informing them of the incident.  A \nwarrant had not yet been issued so he told the police where he could be located.  He \nwas arrested the next day after an arrest warrant was issued and he voluntarily returned \nto the state where the incident took place.  Applicant was charged with the felony of \ncommitting a lewd act upon a child under 16.  He informed his supervisor and others at \nhis company of the incident and his arrest.  He pled guilty to the felony offense on \nJanuary 4, 2006, and was sentenced to 12 years incarceration, suspended.  He was \nplaced on probation of four years.  He was required to register as a sex offended.  \nApplicant admitted and never denied the conduct whether questioned by the girl's \nfather, criminal investigators for the state, or security investigators.  He was straight \nforward and honest in his statements concerning the incident (Tr, 127-145; Gov. Ex. 4, \nApplicant's statement, dated December 19, 2006; See, Hearing Exhibit 1 and 2, State \nStatute on Sex Offender Registry; Gov. Ex. 2, Sex Offender Registry, dated December \n12, 2007).  When Applicant went to another state on business, he was also required to \nregister as a sex offender.  He did comply with the rules and direction and registered as \na sex offender (Gov. Ex. 3, sex offender registry, dated December 10, 2007).  \n \nDuring a subsequent investigation by child protective service, it was reported that \nApplicant gave wine to his daughter when she was 13 years old and placed the hands \nof the sister of the girl in the May 2005 incident between his knees while on a fishing trip \nto keep them warm.  The allegations were investigated but not substantiated and no \naction was taken.  The allegations of the incidents were dropped.  There are no other \ncharges in the state pending against Applicant (App. Ex. D, Record check, dated \nJanuary 21, 2009). \n \nThe father of the victim of the lewd act testified that he has known Applicant for \nover ten years.  When he went to work for Applicant's initial employer, he was on the \nsame shift as Applicant and they became friends.  Applicant was always a good worker \nand was sent out on jobs because of his ability.  He was proud of his work, open-\nminded to improvements, and always working to get the job done.  He was always calm, \nand he never saw him excited or upset.  Applicant was always honest, truthful, and \nfollowed the rules.  He was selected for the employer's technical improvement program \nand became a set-up mechanic.   \n \nTheir families were close and they did activities together.  In fact, he worked with \nApplicant in Applicant's part-time side business. When he learned of the incident with \nhis daughter and Applicant, he called Applicant.  Applicant informed him that his \ndaughter was truthful and he admitted the circumstances of the incident.  He felt \nApplicant was honest and truthful with him about the incident (Tr. 32-44).   \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant's probation officer testified that he has been a probation officer for \nabout 11 years.  He previously served in the Navy and worked in the naval shipyard for \n19 years.  He was Applicant's probation officer from January 2006 until he retired on \nJune 27, 2008.  He saw Applicant once a month in his office and on one or two home \nvisits a month.  Applicant followed the rules and performed satisfactorily during his \nprobation.  The witness trusted Applicant to do what he was required to do, but he did \nverify that he performed as required.  Applicant was required to attend counseling and \nhe did what was required.  He was required to and did register as a sex offender.  He \nwould expect Applicant to conform to the terms and conditions of his probation.  A lot of \nprobationers violate the rules of probation, but Applicant was always cooperative.  The \nwitness considered the 12 year sentence to be fair and very motivating.  It was an \nattention getter.  He believes Applicant is calm and laid back, has a responsible position \nat work, and his employer thinks highly of him.  Applicant four year probation will end in \n2010 (Tr. 45-61).   \n \nApplicant's therapist, a licensed mental health counselor (App. Ex. B, Curricula \nVitae) testified that he has been a therapist for sexual abuse offenders for over 11 years \nand counseled over 100 people.  He also does general mental health counseling and \ncontributes to professional journals on mental health issues. \n \nHe has seen Applicant in a clinical setting once a month in group therapy and \nonce a month in an individual session since the sentence was imposed in January \n2006.  Applicant was always candid and honest in these sessions.  He is laid back and \nnot prone to anger.  He is conscientious about following the rules, and is always straight \nforward, truthful, and forth coming.  His initial diagnosis was Applicant had an \nadjustment disorder with a disturbance of conduct.  This diagnosis is used when a \ntherapist is not sure if the patient has a problem.  After six months of therapy, he \nchanged his evaluation to an impulse control diagnosis with intermittent explosive \ndisorder.  He further opined that Applicant is not a pedophile, sociopath, psychopath, or \nhas an anti-social personality.  Applicant simply made a mistake in judgment.  This \nsituation has not recurred and is not likely to recur.  He believes Applicant would protect \nclassified information (Tr. 62-95). \n \nApplicant's supervisor testified that he has worked with Applicant for about six \nyears.  Applicant started as an electronic technician and is now a network specialist.  He \nis very loyal to the company, serious about his job, and proactive.  He is respected by \nhis fellow workers and follows directions.  Applicant has not been involved in any \ninappropriate behavior at work.  He has held a security clearance while employed by the \ncompany.  He prepared the Applicant's performance reviews since he has been with the \ncompany and rated him as an excellent employee who is an asset to the company (App. \nEx. C, Evaluations, dated October 16, 2008, June 29, 2006, and June 30, 2004).  He is \nabsolutely sure Applicant would protect classified information (Tr. 96-112).   \n \nA government employee who oversees Applicant's work from the employer for \nthe government testified that he controls Applicant's work.  Applicant is a good worker.  \nHe is a regular, normal person, who is neither excitable nor laid back.  Applicant will do \n\n \n5 \n \n \nwhat is required for his sentence for the sexual misbehavior and criminal conduct \nincident.  He is so reliable that he has absolute trust in Applicant's ability to protect \nclassified information (Tr. 112-126).   \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe security concerns raised for Applicant are all from the same incident.  \nSecurity concerns are raised for sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal \nconduct and are the same for each.  The security concern involves questions of \nApplicant's reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness.  Sexual behavior that involves a \ncriminal offense indicates a personality or emotional disorder, reflecting lack of \njudgment or discretion which can raise questions about the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information (AG \u00b6 12).  Criminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulation (AG \u00b6 30).  Personal conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  Since the security concerns are similar, the concerns will be discussed as \na group. \n \n \nApplicant admits and the information clearly establishes that he committed a \nlewd act on a child under the age of 16.  This criminal offense establishes the Sexual \nBehavior Disqualifying Condition (SB DC) AG \u00b6 13(a) \"sexual behavior of a criminal \nnature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted.\"  This is a felony offense and \nestablishes Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) \"a single serious \ncrime or multiple lesser offenses.\"  Since Applicant is still under his sentence to \nprobation, CC DC AG \u00b6 31(d) \"individual is currently on parole or probation\" is also \nestablished.  The incident also establishes Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \n(PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(c) \"credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guidelines, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulation, or other character issues indicating that the person \nmay not properly safeguard protected information.\" \n \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence by way of Applicant's admission \nand statements to establish the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 31(a), 31(d), and \n16(c).  The burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the security concerns under sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal \nconduct.  An applicant has the burden to refute an established allegation or prove a \nmitigating condition, and the burden to prove or disprove it never shifts to the \ngovernment. \n \nEach of the alleged security concerns has a similar mitigating condition.  These \nmitigating conditions involve the passage of time, the unusual nature of the action \ncausing security concerns, the likelihood of recurrence, and whether the actions cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.  I considered Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) \u00b6 32(a) \"so much time has elapsed since the \ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is \n\n \n7 \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment\"; Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition (SB MC) AG \u00b6 14(b) \"the \nsexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\"; and Personal Conduct Mitigating \nCondition (PC MC) AG \u00b6 17(c) \"the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or \nthe behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment.\"  The incident took place in May 2005, and Applicant pled guilty to \nthe felony of committing lewd acts on a child under 16 and sentenced in January 2006 \nto a suspended jail sentence of 12 years and four year probation.  The incident took \nplace almost four years ago.  Applicant is still serving his period of probation, and \nattending therapy with a mental health professional.  Four years is not a long time to \nestablish successful rehabilitation for a felony offense such as lewd acts on a child \nunder 16.  There were no unusual circumstances causing Applicant to commit the \noffense.  He was not forced into the action and his judgment was not impaired by any \nsubstance abuse or other circumstances.  While Applicant appears on the path to \nrehabilitation for his sexual deviant and criminal conduct, he has not provided sufficient \ninformation to establish that it would not happen again.  Accordingly, he has not \nestablished these mitigating conditions for the security concerns alleged. \n \nSuccessful rehabilitation is also a factor to consider in mitigating the security \nconcerns.  There is no rehabilitative mitigating condition for deviant sexual behavior.  \nHowever, I have considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(d) \n\"there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement\"; and \nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) AG \u00b6 17(d) \"the individual has \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.\"  Applicant always acknowledged his behavior and never denied he did \nsomething wrong.  He registered as required as a sex offender and has followed the \ndirectives of registering when he travels to other states.  He has continued to work and \nperform excellently for his employer.  He has not been involved in any conduct that \ncauses security concerns since the incident in May 2005.  He successfully followed the \ndirectives of his probation officer, and faithfully attended counseling, both individual and \ngroup, with his mental health therapist.  There are signs of successful rehabilitation.  \nAgain however, Applicant is still under probation for another ten months and still \nattending mental health counseling.  Under these circumstances, it is too soon to \ndetermine that he has been successfully rehabilitated.  Applicant has not presented \nsufficient information to mitigate security concerns for criminal conduct, sexual behavior, \nand personal conduct.   \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that Applicant is a \ngood employee and a conscientious and dependable worker held in high regard by this \nsupervisors and peers.  Applicant exhibits signs of successful rehabilitation.  He always \nacknowledged his guilt of the offense which is the first sign of rehabilitation.  He is \nremorseful for his conduct and the impact it had on the victim, her family, and his family.  \nHe has followed every direction of his probation officer and has done everything \nrequired of his probation.  He is faithful to his mental health counseling.  While there are \nsigns of rehabilitation, it is too soon to determine that Applicant has been successfully \nrehabilitate, and that sexual behavior or criminal and personal conduct problems will not \narise in the future causing security concerns.  Applicant received a stiff sentence for his \ncriminal conduct.  He is still on probation with the threat of that sentence still real to him.  \nUnder these circumstances, Applicant can be expected to exhibit good behavior or he \nwould face significant adverse consequences.  He is still living under direct supervision \nof the probation officer.  Society has a stake in ensuring that Applicant continues to be \nsupervised.  Under these circumstances it is too soon to determine that he can be \ntrusted with access to classified information.  Overall, on balance the record evidence \nleaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability at this time \nfor a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns arising from his criminal and personal conduct, and sexual \nbehavior.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline E: \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied knowing use of cocaine under Guideline H, but admitted he was separated from the Navy Reserve with a General Discharge under Honorable Conditions for use of cocaine under Guidelines H and E. He provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. I thoroughly and carefully reviewed the case file and the pleadings. I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 39-year-old senior business analyst for a defense contractor for over ten years. He served six years on active duty with the Navy, and six years in the Navy Reserve. He has both a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree. He has been married over eight years but has known his wife for over 18 years. He has two step-children from his wife\u2019s first marriage, and a child with his wife. Applicant has held a security clearance since 1987. (Tr. 20-22, 50-51; Gov. Ex. 1, security clearance application, dated September 21, 2006) 3 Applicant attended a housewarming party at the home of a fellow Navy Reservist on the night of July 6, 2006. He only knew a few people at the party. He stayed for about two hours and had two alcoholic drinks mixed by a bartender and smoked half a cigar offered to him by one of the party attendees. He left the party about 9:00 pm and arrived home about 15 minutes later. He went to bed and rose early the next morning to attend the normally scheduled Navy Reserve drill.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel \nApplicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on September \n21, 2006. On November 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for drug involvement \nand personal conduct under Guidelines H and E.  The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on \nNovember 19, 2007.   \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 8, 2007.  Applicant tested \npositive for cocaine in July 2006.  He denied that he knowingly used cocaine.  He \nadmitted he was administratively discharged from the United States Navy Reserve with \na General Discharge under Honorable Conditions based on the positive urinalysis test.  \nJune 16, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nHe requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed with the case on January 31, 2008.  The case was assigned to \nanother Administrative Judge on February 1, 2008, and reassigned to me on February \n21, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 18, 2008, for a hearing on April \n29, 2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered four exhibits, \nmarked government exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without \nobjection.  Applicant submitted 37 documents, marked as Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) \nA-MM, which were received without objection.  Applicant and one witness testified on \nhis behalf.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on May 9, 2008.  The \nunderlying basis for a security concern is the use of illegal drugs.  The illegal drug use \ncauses concern in two areas, the use of an illegal drug itself, and the resulting \nadministrative board action of discharge from the Navy Reserve with a General \nDischarge under Honorable Conditions.   Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of SECNAV \nInstruction 1920.6B, Administrative Separation of Officers, admitted as Court Exhibit I.  \nThe Instruction sets forth the policies, standards, and procedures for the administrative \nseparation of Navy and Marine Corps officers.  I took administrative notice of Enclosure \n3, paragraph 1b (2) of the instruction, which required mandatory processing for \nseparations for unlawful drug involvement.  I also take administrative notice of \nEnclosure 8 which provides procedures to be followed to review and evaluate \ncommissioned officers to determine whether the officer should be required to show \ncause for retention on active duty.  I also take administrative notice of the procedures in \nEnclosure 8 which provides for a Board of Inquiry to give the officer a full and impartial \nhearing to respond to, and rebut, allegations, as well as present favorable information \non separation and characterization of service. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied knowing use of cocaine under Guideline H, but admitted he was \nseparated from the Navy Reserve with a General Discharge under Honorable \nConditions for use of cocaine under Guidelines H and E.  He provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  I thoroughly and \ncarefully reviewed the case file and the pleadings.  I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old senior business analyst for a defense contractor for \nover ten years.  He served six years on active duty with the Navy, and six years in the \nNavy Reserve.  He has both a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree.  He has been married \nover eight years but has known his wife for over 18 years.  He has two step-children \nfrom his wife\u2019s first marriage, and a child with his wife.  Applicant has held a security \nclearance since 1987. (Tr. 20-22, 50-51; Gov. Ex. 1, security clearance application, \ndated September 21, 2006) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant attended a housewarming party at the home of a fellow Navy Reservist \non the night of July 6, 2006.  He only knew a few people at the party.  He stayed for \nabout two hours and had two alcoholic drinks mixed by a bartender and smoked half a \ncigar offered to him by one of the party attendees.  He left the party about 9:00 pm and \narrived home about 15 minutes later.  He went to bed and rose early the next morning \nto attend the normally scheduled Navy Reserve drill. (Tr. 46-47, 52-55, 58-63) \n \n \nApplicant attended his Navy Reserve week-end drill on July 7, 2006.  His division \nwas directed to undergo a drug test urinalysis.  Applicant was the division officer at the \ndrill.  He was informed of the test at 0830 and provided his sample at 0912.  Applicant \ncould have provided excuses not to take the test for any number of reasons.  However, \nhe voluntarily provided the sample required.  Applicant tested positive for cocaine.  He \nwas using two prescription drugs at the time for a back injury but neither drug would \nhave caused a positive test for cocaine. (Tr. 47-48)   \n \n \nApplicant has consistently denied knowing use of cocaine. (See, Gov. Ex. 2, \nInterrogatories, dated May 24, 2007; Gov. Ex. 3, Response to SOR, dated May 31, \n2007; Gov. Ex. 4, Interrogatories, dated September 12, 2007)  Applicant has signed a \nstatement that if there is any indication of future drug use or misconduct, it would be \ngrounds for immediate termination of his clearance. (App. Ex. KK, statement, dated \nApril 29, 2008) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife credibly testified that she has known Applicant for over 18 years \nand they have been married for over eight years.  Applicant is actively involved as a \nparent, attends church, and participates in golf and fishing.  She has never seen or \nknown him to use illegal drugs.  He is a good family man who goes to work and comes \nhome in the evening.  He takes care of his children.  She can count on him to watch \ntheir youngest child.  She manages the family finances and their finances are sound.  \nShe has never seen Applicant make any unusual expenditure. (Tr. 20-30.   \n \n \nApplicant presented information that he received awards for his performance \nduring the period immediately before he tested positive for cocaine in July 2006. He \nreceived two letters of commendation from an Army Major General for his performance \nand assistance to the Army command. (App. Ex. BB, Letters, dated May 12, 2006 and \nJune 1, 2006)  His performance evaluation for the period March 6, 2006 until March 6, \n2007, shows excellent duty performance with no issues of misconduct. (App. Ex. MM, \nPerformance Review, dated March 6, 2007)  He was also inducted into his employer\u2019s \norganization for employees that have outstanding professional performance. (App. Ex. \nDD, Letter, dated June 21, 2006)   \n \n \nApplicant presented information that he is a good family man. (App. Exs. A-B, \nPictures, undated)  He presented information that his over five years of enlisted service, \nwith over four years of sea service, was excellent.  He was enlisted surface warfare \nqualified, and awarded the Navy Achievement Medal and Good Conduct Award among \nother decorations.  He received an honorable discharge. (App. Exs. C-S, Enlisted \nService Record, various dates)  He entered college after his discharge and received a \nbachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree from the same university (App. Ex. V, transcripts, dated \n\n \n4 \n \nDecember 13, 1997, and December 17, 2000)  He applied for and received a \ncommissioned in the Navy Reserve on August 23, 2004. (App. Ex. T, Memorandum, \ndated October 4, 2004) \n \n \nApplicant presented various letters of recommendation at the Administrative \nBoard in January 2007.  These letters were from his Navy Reserve superiors in the rank \nof Captain and Lieutenant Commander.  The individuals know of the positive drug test \nresults for cocaine.  They attest that his Navy Reserve performance was excellent and \nhe made contributions to the unit\u2019s mission.  They recommended his continued service \nin the Navy Reserve.  (App. Exs. W-Y, Letters, dated January 2, 2007, December 29, \n2006, and January 7, 2007).  An active duty senior chief who has extensive contact with \nApplicant as a liaison with the Navy Reserve noted that Applicant is a solid professional \nwho is a model for other sailors.  He also recommended continued service in the Navy \nReserve. (App. Ex. Z, Letter, dated January 5, 2007)   \n \n \nApplicant presented information from his civilian supervisor noting that he has \ngood character traits and cares about his wife and children.  Applicant is a valued \nemployee who contributes to the mission and can always be counted on to be an \nexcellent performer. (App. Ex. AA, Letter, dated January 2, 2007)   \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant presented another letter from his Navy Reserve \nsupervising Captain attesting to his good character and outstanding performance of \nduty. (App. Ex. EE, Letter, dated April 12, 2008)  Applicant also presented information \nfrom Army employees that he supports through his employment attesting to his good \ncharacter and excellent support to the Army.  The authors of the letters do not note if \nthey are aware of the positive test results for cocaine. (App. Exs. FF-JJ, Letters, various \ndates)   \n \n \nNavy regulations require that an officer testing positive for use of a controlled \nsubstance must be considered for separation from the Navy.  Applicant went before an \nadministrative board in January 2007.  Applicant denied ever using cocaine but could \nnot explain the positive test result for cocaine.  He noted his activities at the \nhousewarming the night before the test and as the only known time he could have been \nexposed to cocaine.  Two board members voted to discharge Applicant and one voted \nto retain him.  Two board members determined that Applicant used cocaine and that he \nshould be separated from the Navy with a General Discharge under Honorable \nConditions. The senior member voted that Applicant did not use cocaine and should be \nretained. (Tr. 55-57, Gov. Ex. 3, Board action, dated March 26, 2007, at 2)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n5 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair \njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Drugs are mood and behavior altering \nsubstances, and include those listed on the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  Drug \n\n \n6 \n \nabuse is the illegal use of a drug or the use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction. (AG \u00b6 24) \n \nThe positive drug test for cocaine on July 7, 2006, and the Administrative Board \ndetermination of knowing drug use of January 7, 2007, are sufficient information to raise \nDrug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) \u00b6 25(a) (any drug use), and DI DC \u00b6 \n25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, \nsale, or distribution).  The positive drug test and the administrative board findings, even \nthough not unanimous, permit me, but do not require me, to conclude that Applicant \nknowingly used cocaine.  Since the government produced substantial evidence to raise \nthe disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the illegal drug use. (Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15)  An applicant has the burden to refute an established allegation or prove a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government (See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nApplicant has consistently and repeatedly denied that he knowingly used \ncocaine.  He acknowledges that the urinalysis test was positive for cocaine, but he \ncannot explain how the illegal drug was ingested.  He provided compelling information \nconcerning his lifestyle and work ethic to establish that he is not the type of person who \nwould use illegal drugs.  The lifestyle information and his denial of illegal drug use \ncoupled with the inability to explain how the illegal drug was ingested are not sufficient \nto meet his heavy burden of establishing that he did not knowingly use cocaine.  \nApplicant has failed to refute the inference of knowing use of cocaine.  However, he is \nstill permitted to present information to mitigate the disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nAt best, Applicant used cocaine on a single occasion in July 2006.  There is no \ninformation in the case file to indicate illegal drug use before or after that time.  \nApplicant\u2019s denial of knowing cocaine use and lifestyle information that he is not the \ntype of person to use illegal drugs raises Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI \nMC) \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and DI MC \u00b6 26(b) \n(a demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as; (1) disassociation from \ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where \ndrugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation).   \n \n \nThere is only one incident of drug use in July 2006.  The use happened over two \nyears ago and there is no indication that Applicant has used illegal drugs since that \ntime.  His nearly two years of abstinence from cocaine is an appropriate period to show \nthe behavior happened long ago.  The circumstance of the use is unusual since it is a \none time use at a social event, even though Applicant has not met his heavy burden to \nrefute knowing use.  His wife established that he is a good husband and father who \ntakes care of his family and does not exhibit any signs or symptoms of illegal drug use.  \nHis work performance is exceptional and he has received awards for the work he was \nperforming during the same time frame as the established illegal drug use.  The use in \n\n \n7 \n \nJuly 2006 happened long ago, was infrequent, and under unusual circumstances.  The \navailable information shows that the use of cocaine is not likely to recur.   \n \n \nApplicant has also shown his intent not to use illegal drugs.  He does not \nassociate with drug users and he does not frequent places of drug use.  He signed a \nstatement of automatic revocation of clearance for any violation of illegal drug use.  \nApplicant\u2019s failure to admit cocaine use in the face of his positive drug test might \nsuggest that he has not demonstrated rehabilitation.  In this case, Applicant has \nreasonable cause not to admit what he vehemently disputes.  In any event, on this \nrecord, even believing Applicant knowingly used cocaine; it is extremely unlikely that he \nwould do so again.  Applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that he has no desire to \nabuse drugs in the future.  He has mitigated security concerns based on the use of \ncocaine in July 2006.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.   \n \nApplicant was administratively discharged with a General Discharge under \nHonorable Conditions from the Navy Reserve for use of an illegal drug.  This \ninformation raises Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, \nor concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, \nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. . .)   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s denial of drug use and his letter of automatic revocation raises \nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken \npositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress.)  Assuming that Applicant used an illegal drug in July 2006, the evidence \nstrongly supports that he does not use illegal drugs now.  His wife, employer, and fellow \nworkers know of the past allegation of illegal drug use as well as his discharge from the \nNavy Reserve with a General Discharge under Honorable Conditions.  Since \nAppellant\u2019s discharge and illegal drug use is known, his vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation and duress have been reduce or eliminated.  I find for Applicant as to \nPersonal Conduct.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \n\n \n8 \n \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that Applicant tested \npositive for cocaine use on one urinalysis in July 2006.  I considered Applicant\u2019s present \nintent not to use drugs.  I considered his wife\u2019s evaluation that he is a good family man \nand she sees no indication of illegal drug use.  I considered the awards he received for \nhis work, and the evaluations of his civilian and Navy supervisors and fellow workers.  I \nconsidered that he has signed a letter of automatic revocation that if he should use \nillegal drugs in the future he would lose his security clearance.  Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with no questions and doubts that Applicant will not use illegal \ndrugs in the future.  I have no doubts or questions about his eligibility and suitability for \na security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from his illegal drug use and personal conduct  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except SOR subparagraphs 1.i through 1.m. Applicant is a 55-year-old man with two adult children. He has been married for more than 30 years. He has a high school education. Since 1973, he has worked as a security guard. Throughout Applicant\u2019s marriage, his wife has struggled with disabling health problems that have prevented her from working (Tr. 49). Her condition worsened in 2001. Over the next three years, she was hospitalized for ten months. Before then, she had primary responsibility for managing the family finances. Afterwards, Applicant managed them, and gradually lost control. At or about the time Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s health worsened, his sick, elderly brother moved in with them (Tr. 51). Insurance covered most of the wife\u2019s medical expenses, and the brother\u2019s retirement pension covered his medical expenses (Tr. 73). As Applicant grew increasingly preoccupied with caring for his family members, his debts increasingly fell behind. By 2007, he had accrued approximately $24,000 of delinquent debt. SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.g, 1.i, and 1.k through 1.m are credit card delinquencies. SOR subparagraph 1.h is a delinquent loan, and SOR subparagraph 1.j is a delinquent medical bill. Applicant satisfied SOR subparagraphs 1.j (Exhibit G) and 1.m (Exhibit S, Tr. 43). He has not satisfied the remainder.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 30, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on August 31,\n2007. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 30, 2007, and I\nreceived the case assignment on November 15, 2007 after the case was transferred\nfrom another administrative judge. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 21,\n2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 11, 2007. During the\nJanuary 17, 2008\n\nApplicant submitted 25 exhibits. He later withdrew three (Exhibits Q, W, and Y).\n1\nIn the last 7 years, have you ever been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\n2\nAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\n3\n2\nhearing, I received nine government exhibits, 22 Applicant exhibits,  and Applicant\u2019s\n1\ntestimony. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 19, 2007.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.i through 1.m.\nApplicant is a 55-year-old man with two adult children. He has been married for\nmore than 30 years. He has a high school education. Since 1973, he has worked as a\nsecurity guard.\nThroughout Applicant\u2019s marriage, his wife has struggled with disabling health\nproblems that have prevented her from working (Tr. 49). Her condition worsened in\n2001. Over the next three years, she was hospitalized for ten months. Before then, she\nhad primary responsibility for managing the family finances. Afterwards, Applicant\nmanaged them, and gradually lost control.\nAt or about the time Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s health worsened, his sick, elderly brother\nmoved in with them (Tr. 51). Insurance covered most of the wife\u2019s medical expenses,\nand the brother\u2019s retirement pension covered his medical expenses (Tr. 73). As\nApplicant grew increasingly preoccupied with caring for his family members, his debts\nincreasingly fell behind.\nBy 2007, he had accrued approximately $24,000 of delinquent debt. SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g, 1.i, and 1.k through 1.m are credit card delinquencies.\nSOR subparagraph 1.h is a delinquent loan, and SOR subparagraph 1.j is a delinquent\nmedical bill.\nApplicant satisfied SOR subparagraphs 1.j (Exhibit G) and 1.m (Exhibit S, Tr.\n43). He has not satisfied the remainder. At the hearing, he denied all of the remaining\ndebt, alleging that his brother and/or his wife had incurred them (Tr. 67). He offered no\nevidence supporting this contention.\nApplicant failed to disclose his delinquent debt in response to security clearance\napplication Questions 38  and 39.  When asked about these omissions at the hearing,\n2\n3\nhe reiterated the debts were not his responsibility.\n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\nThe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\n4\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nThe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\n5\nis being resolved or is under control.\nThe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n6\nThe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problems\n7\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue.\nThe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\n8\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline includes several potentially disqualifying conditions. Here, the\napplicable ones are AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,@AG &\n19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations, and AG \u00b6 19(e), consistent\nspending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness,\nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\nThe guideline also includes several potentially mitigating conditions, addressing\nissues such as, among other things, the cause of the indebtedness, efforts toward debt\nresolution, whether the applicant has enrolled in debt management counseling, and the\napplicant\u2019s current financial status (see generally, AG \u00b6 20). Here, Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems are ongoing, rendering AG \u00b6 20(a)  inapplicable. He has only satisfied two\n4\ndelinquent debts, collectively less than $600. He has neither established a good-faith\nbasis supporting his dispute of the debts, sought financial counseling, nor developed a\npayment plan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) , 20(d) , or 20(e)  do not apply. Although his financial\n5\n6\n7\nproblems were caused by his preoccupation with his family members\u2019 serious health\nproblems, his failure to act responsibly under the circumstances renders AG \u00b6 20(b)8\ninapplicable.\n\nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\n9\nhistory statement, or similar form use to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nA single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\n10\n5\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Also, \u201c[o]f special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate\nwith the security clearance process\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s omission of relevant financial information from his SF 86 triggers the\nissue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a)  applies. His credibility was irrevocably undermined when\n9\nat the hearing, he recanted, without explanation, his SOR admissions. I conclude\nApplicant falsified his SF 86 by omitting relevant financial information. AG \u00b6 16(a)\napplies without mitigation.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Moreover, \u201c[b]y its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations\u201d (Id.).  \nApplicant\u2019s SF 86 falsification constitutes a crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. AG \u00b6\n31 (a)  applies. I have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. \n10\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n\n6\nApplicant accrued $24,000 of delinquent debt between 2001 and 2007. Although\nthey were caused, in part, by his inability to manage his finances after his wife\u2019s health\nworsened in 2001, he has made minimal efforts at satisfying or otherwise resolving\nthem. Instead, he chose to omit them from his security clearance application. Evaluating\nthis case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant remains a\nsecurity risk.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.k - 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline J, criminal conduct, that Applicant was arrested on July 2006 for simple assault resulting in a restraining order against him (SOR \u00b6 1.a), was arrested the following day for violation of that restraining order and sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended for one year (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and was arrested and charged in September 2006 with five counts of violation of the restraining order but pleaded guilty to one count (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have falsified material facts on his September 2006 SF 86 by failing to disclose his arrests. Since the government now concedes the omissions were unintentional, the matters relating to Guideline E will not be discussed further and favorable findings will be entered for Applicant as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. In his amended Answer, Applicant admitted the arrests that occurred during a tumultuous time in his marital relationship with his third wife, but denied he assaulted her or that he violated the restraining order. He explained that he was arrested in July 2006 for allowing a third person (his mother) to call his wife, although he did not ask or want his mother to contact her. Applicant averred he pleaded guilty to one charge of violating the restraining order in September 2006 because he went over to his ex-wife in front of the courthouse, but she had waived him over.

On July 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline J and\nGuideline E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nWith the assistance of legal counsel, Applicant answered the SOR in writing on\nSeptember 19, 2007, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On\nSeptember 27, 2007, DOHA notified Applicant that his response was not complete. On\nOctober 9, 2007, again with the help of legal counsel, Applicant filed an amended\nanswer to the SOR in which he reiterated his request for a hearing. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on January 3, 2008, and the case was assigned to\nApril 17, 2008\n\n2\nme on January 30, 2008. On February 1, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for February 29,\n2008.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. The government\u2019s case consisted of three\nexhibits (Ex. 1-3). Applicant represented himself. He and his girlfriend testified on his\nbehalf, and he submitted 23 exhibits (Ex. A-W) that were entered without objections. A\ntranscript (Tr.) of the hearing was received by DOHA on March 11, 2008.\nThe record was held open until March 21, 2008, for clarification concerning the\npaperwork completed in application for Applicant\u2019s security clearance. On March 18,\n2008, Applicant submitted a timeline prepared by him and an adverse information report\nfrom his employer. On March 20, 2008, Department Counsel indicated she had no\nobjections to their admission, and they were entered as exhibits X and Y, respectively.\nDepartment Counsel also conceded based on the evidence that Applicant\u2019s failure to list\nhis arrests on his September 2006 SF 86 was unintentional. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline J, criminal conduct, that Applicant was arrested\non July 2006 for simple assault resulting in a restraining order against him (SOR \u00b6 1.a),\nwas arrested the following day for violation of that restraining order and sentenced to 30\ndays in jail, suspended for one year (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and was arrested and charged in\nSeptember 2006 with five counts of violation of the restraining order but pleaded guilty\nto one count (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged\nto have falsified material facts on his September 2006 SF 86 by failing to disclose his\narrests. Since the government now concedes the omissions were unintentional, the\nmatters relating to Guideline E will not be discussed further and favorable findings will\nbe entered for Applicant as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b.\nIn his amended Answer, Applicant admitted the arrests that occurred during a\ntumultuous time in his marital relationship with his third wife, but denied he assaulted\nher or that he violated the restraining order. He explained that he was arrested in July\n2006 for allowing a third person (his mother) to call his wife, although he did not ask or\nwant his mother to contact her. Applicant averred he pleaded guilty to one charge of\nviolating the restraining order in September 2006 because he went over to his ex-wife in\nfront of the courthouse, but she had waived him over. After consideration of the\nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old microwave assembler specialist who has worked for\nhis present employer, a defense contractor, since late April 2002 (Ex. 1, Ex. N).  He has\nheld a security clearance since October 21, 2002 (Ex. Y, Tr. 104).\nThree months into his marriage to his first wife, Applicant entered on active duty\nin the United States Coast Guard in about January 1979 (Ex. 1, Ex. N). He was a\n\nDuring an interview with a government investigator on January 31, 2007, Applicant indicated this incident,\n1\nand his mother telephoning his spouse, occurred on July 23 and 24, 2006, respectively (Ex. 2). Court\ndocuments show the events took place over the July 29-30, 2006, time frame (Ex. A, Ex. B, Ex. G, Ex. Q).\nApplicant testified that he knew a three-day emergency protection order had been issued against him when\n2\nhe was released (Tr. 122). Court records indicate a protective order was issued on July 30, 2006 (Ex. Q).\n3\nsteady, dependable damage controlman who exhibited pride in his work during the ten\nmonths he was aboard a Coast Guard vessel (Ex. U). In April 1983, he separated from\nactive duty at the rank of petty officer third class and went to work in the commercial\nsector (Ex. 1, Ex. N).\nIn March 1984, he married his second wife (Ex. 1, Ex. N), and they had three\nchildren (Ex. N, Tr. 101). They divorced in November 1994 (Ex. 1). Applicant was\nemployed during this time as a chemical technician for an analog devices company. He\nwas a very conscientious worker who was self-motivated and responsible, including in\nall aspects of safety and security. He distinguished himself by his cooperative attitude\nand leadership style (Ex. O).\nIn March 2002, Applicant went to work as an airport screener. He left the job after\nonly one month to work for his present employer (Ex. 1, Ex. N). Applicant showed little\ninitiative or interest in his initial duties and his work performance was rated as marginal\nfor his first eight months on the job. Over the next year, he found his expertise as a\nrework person and in a short period, he became an essential part of an array test team.\nHe exhibited excellent job knowledge, teamwork, cooperation, and initiative, resulting in\nan overall performance rating of excellent for 2003. In 2004, Applicant expanded his\nskills in all aspects of the rework processes required to support the test technicians in\nthe array test area, and his overall performance was rated as outstanding. He continued\nto be self-motivated in 2005, and was considered to be \u201ca definite asset to his team, the\nshift, and the company.\u201d (Ex. C).\nIn late January 2006, Applicant married his third wife (Ex. E, Ex. N). She had\nbeen married three times before (Ex. E). They had marital problems almost from the\nstart, in part exacerbated by her depressive disorder (Ex. 2, Tr. 113-14). On July 29,\n2006,  Applicant and his spouse had a disagreement over the computer. Around 1:00\n1\np.m. that day, Applicant had a friend over to assess the computer problem. His spouse\nrefused to cooperate with requests from his friend for information. After his spouse\ncame home from work, Applicant told her he wanted a divorce, and he left the premises.\nHe and his spouse argued when he returned later that night. Applicant called the police\nto calm her down. After she complained he had hit her on the leg with a telephone,\nApplicant was arrested for simple assault, a class A misdemeanor (Ex. 2, Ex. A, Ex. B,\nTr. 109-21).  A family court judge issued an emergency order of protection on July 30,\n2\n2006, ordering Applicant to have no contact, including by third persons, with his spouse\n(Ex. Q).\nFollowing his arrest, Applicant went to stay at his mother\u2019s home. Needing\nclothes so that he could report to work, Applicant\u2019s mother contacted his spouse on July\n\n4\n30, 2006 (Ex. 2, Tr. 122). Applicant denies he asked his mother to call his spouse and\nthat he was sleeping at the time (Tr. 123-24). His spouse got angry and contacted the\npolice. Applicant was arrested and charged with violating a protective order, a class A\nmisdemeanor (Ex. 2, Ex. Q). In court on July 31, 2006, Applicant pleaded nolo\ncontendere but was found guilty and sentenced to 30 days in the house of correction,\nsuspended for one year on good behavior, and no contact with his spouse pursuant to\nany pending protective order (Ex. G, Tr. 126).\n On August 10, 2006, Applicant was formally charged with simple assault of his\nspouse on July 29, 2006 (Ex. 2, Ex. A, Ex. B). She was granted an automatic restraining\norder for one year (Tr. 137). He planned to file for divorce while at the courthouse.\nBefore entering the courthouse, his spouse called him over to her vehicle. Applicant\nassumed she wanted to discuss the divorce so he went over. Applicant maintains that\nafter she made derogatory statements, he went inside the courthouse as he did not\nwant to get into trouble (Tr. 129-30). Applicant left the premises after filing for divorce\n(Ex. E, Tr. 130).\nOn or about August 31, 2006, Applicant filled out a security clearance application\n(Ex. N), apparently for a top secret clearance. Applicant testified that he was granted a\ntop secret clearance but that it was not active since he did not need it for his present\nduties (Tr. 104-05).\nOn September 5, 2006, Applicant was charged with four counts of violating a\nprotective order for going over to his spouse\u2019s car and talking to her on August 10, 2006\n(Ex. H), and with a fifth count on a complaint from his spouse that he telephoned her\nand left a message on her answering machine on August 9, 2006 (\u201cOh, and then she\nsaid that I called her or something. She made a few lies, so I think they weren\u2019t able to\nprove them.\u201d Tr. 133) (Ex. K).\nApplicant appeared in court on November 16, 2006, on the simple assault and\nthe September 2006 violation of restraining order charges. He pleaded not guilty to the\nsimple assault, and the charge was filed without a finding for one year (Ex. B). Under a\nnegotiated plea, Applicant changed his plea to guilty of the restraining order violations.\nHe was convicted and sentenced on one count for violating the order on August 10,\n2006, to 30 days in the house of correction/30 days deferred on one year of good\nbehavior (no felonies, misdemeanors or motor vehicle violations) (Tr. 133). At the end of\nthat year, he could petition to suspend the 30-day jail sentence for one year. The\nremaining counts were filed without a finding (Ex. I, Ex. J, Ex. L, Ex. M). Applicant\u2019s\ndivorce became final on October 25, 2006 (Ex. E).\nApplicant notified his facility security officer of his arrests for simple assault and\nfor violation of a restraining order. Applicant testified with no rebuttal from the\ngovernment that he notified his employer within a week of his arrests (Tr. 136). On\nNovember 28, 2006, his employer submitted an adverse information report to DISCO\nnotifying the government of Applicant\u2019s arrests in July 2006 for simple assault and\nviolation of a restraining order (Ex. Y).\n\n5\nOn January 31, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government-authorized\ninvestigator about the simple assault and violation of restraining order charges in July\n2006. Applicant indicated that all charges against him had been dropped with the\nexception of two violations of the restraining order: for his mother calling his spouse on\nJuly 24, 2006 [sic] and for him contacting her in the parking lot on an unrecalled date\n(Ex. 2).\nIn June 2007, Applicant was asked by DOHA to update information regarding his\ncourt appearances and arrests. He indicated he had not been charged with any\nprotective order violations since September 2006 (Ex. 3), and there is no evidence to\nthe contrary.\nThe protective order against him expired in August 2007. On September 10,\n2007, Applicant petitioned for return of the firearm that he had to surrender to the police\nunder the domestic violence protective order (Ex. R). Applicant\u2019s ex-wife does not\nconsider Applicant to be a danger to her or to others. She regrets she obtained a\nrestraining order against him. She attributes the July 2006 incident to her being stressed\nout and to her medications for a major depressive disorder (Ex. D).\nApplicant\u2019s personal problems with his third wife did not adversely affect his\nwork. He achieved, and in some cases, exceeded his employer\u2019s requirements. Overall\nfor 2006, he was considered to be a \u201chuge asset to the [bulkhead build work] because\nof his even-tempered disposition and his willingness to help anyone who asks for his\nhelp.\u201d (Ex. F). He continued his good performance in 2007. He was moved into two new\nareas within a year\u2019s span, and accepted the challenges of his new assignments with an\n\u201cexcellent professional attitude.\u201d (Ex. P).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n6\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by Applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG\n\u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d Applicant was arrested in July 2006 for\nsimple assault following an argument with his third wife on her complaint that he had\nstruck her in the leg with a telephone. An emergency protective order was issued\nagainst him, and he was arrested the following day for violating that order because his\nmother contacted his spouse. Additional charges of violating a protective order were\nfiled against him in September 2006, for talking to his spouse outside the courthouse in\nAugust 2006, and on a complaint by his spouse that he had called her the previous day\nand left a message on her answering machine. Applicant denies that he assaulted his\nspouse or that he knowingly violated the protective order in July 2006, although he does\nnot contest that his mother called his spouse. He also does not contest that he spoke to\nhis wife outside the courthouse, but avers he thought it would be okay since it was out\nin the open and she called him over. Applicant maintains that his spouse fabricated the\ntelephone call in August 2006.\n\n7\nAvailable court records show Applicant pleaded nolo contendere to the July 2006\nviolation of the restraining order since his mother contacted his spouse. In November\n2006, he entered into a negotiated plea wherein he changed his plea to guilty on all\ncounts of violating the restraining order in return for his conviction on one count for\nspeaking with his spouse on August 10, 2006.  He continued to protest his innocence of\nthe simple assault by pleading not guilty to that charge, and it was filed without a finding\nby the court. The available record does not prove Applicant assaulted his spouse in July\n2006 (see AG \u00b6 32(c) (\u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense\u201d)), and a\nfavorable finding is warranted as to SOR \u00b6 1.a. However, the evidence establishes\nviolation of the restraining order on two occasions, through his mother on July 30, 2006\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b), and on August 10, 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), after he had been sentenced for the\nJuly charge and ordered to have no contact with his spouse. AG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d) applies.\nApplicant testified he is on two years of unsupervised probation for violating the\nprotective order (Tr. 140). The lawyer who represented him at sentencing in November\n2006 indicates (Ex. M), and the court record confirms (Ex. I), that Applicant was given\n30 days in jail, deferred for one year, and thereafter suspended for one year on a\npetition. Applicant could be incarcerated for 30 days should he commit a criminal\noffense or even a moving violation, but a deferred sentence is not a term of probation\nthat implicates AG \u00b6 31(d) (\u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation\u201d).\nThe restraining order violations are too recent to satisfy the first prong of AG \u00b6\n32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d), but they also occurred in\nthe context of a new marital relationship with someone who contributed to, if not\ncaused, the discord between them. His third wife admits she was having problems with\nher psychiatric medications at the time. An evaluation of the restraining order violations\nshows Applicant exhibited poor judgment in failing to recognize that he should not have\napproached his spouse outside the courthouse, but there is no evidence he intended\nviolence against his soon-to-be ex-wife on that occasion. Although Applicant technically\nviolated the emergency protection order through a third person in July 2006, it was not\nproven that he asked his mother or otherwise approved of her calling his spouse. With\nthe termination of their marriage in October 2006, the criminal conduct is not likely to\nrecur. There is no evidence of domestic violence concerns during Applicant\u2019s second\nmarriage. His performance evaluations are telling in their favorable comments about his\n\u201ceven-tempered disposition.\u201d  Outside of this short-term troubled relationship, Applicant\nhas demonstrated a stable lifestyle and a good employment record free of any criminal\nconduct (see AG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but\nnot limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement\u201d)). Applicant blames his ex-wife:\nI would like to state that after all this was all done, and the restraining\norder was all done, my ex-wife at the time actually came to my house, and\n\n8\nshowed up unannounced, and decided that she wanted me back, which I\nfound totally insane. I just couldn\u2019t believe it myself, that this woman\nactually showed up and wanted me to go back with her, after everything\nshe put me through and done to me (Tr. 148-49).\nOrdinarily, a failure to exhibit sufficient remorse would raise considerable doubts for\none\u2019s rehabilitation, but there is limited evidence of culpability on his part, and his ex-\nwife regrets she obtained a restraining order against him following a \u201cridiculous\nargument\u201d between them when she was \u201cvery stressed out\u201d (Ex. D).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is\nrelatively recent, but also minor at least with respect to the actual behavior by Applicant\nthat led to the criminal charges. He reported the charges to his employer as required\nand has proven his trustworthiness and reliability on the job while holding a security\nclearance since 2002. On the whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue his access.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                \nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has a history of illegal drug\nuse as recent as July 2006,  and a March 2002 charge for possession of marijuana to which she pled\nguilty and was fined $500. She failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under drug\ninvolvement guidelines. She did not intentionally falsify her security clearance application. Thus,\nshe has mitigated the security concern under the personal conduct guidelines. Applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nA Notice of Hearing dated September 4, 2007 was mailed to Applicant. She waived the 15-day period for\n2\nnotice.\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated July 25, 2007.\n3\nGE 1 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated October 3, 2006).\n4\nTr. at 28.\n5\nId.\n6\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 3, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On July 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR,\n1\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline H (Drug\nInvolvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn August 2, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to\nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 29, 2007. A\nnotice of hearing, dated September 4, 2007, scheduled the case by video-teleconference.  I scheduled\n2\nthe hearing for September 18, 2007.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on September 18, 2007, to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nGovernment Exhibits (GE 1-2) were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s  exhibit (AE A) was\nalso admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified in her own behalf. The hearing\ntranscript was received on September 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted to all allegations in the SOR  under Guideline H and Guideline E.  The\n3\nadmissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the\nrecord and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  After graduating from high\n4\nschool in 1994, she worked in various positions.  Applicant attended college courses part time from\n1999 to 2000, with the goal of obtaining a liberal art\u2019s degree. She has worked for her current\nemployer since 1999. Applicant is married with no children.  She completed her first security\n5\nclearance application (SF 86) on October 3, 2006.6\n\nTr.44. \n7\nThis information is not considered for disqualifying purposes, but is considered when analyzing the \u201cwhole\n8\nperson,\u201d and the potential application of mitigating conditions.\nGE 2 (Answer to Interrogatories, dated May 29, 2007).\n9\nTr.33.\n10\nTr.17.\n11\nTr. 38-39.\n12\n3\nWhile in high school, Applicant did not experiment or use any drugs. However, starting in\n1996, Applicant experimented with marijuana in social settings. She acknowledged that she wanted\nto \u201cfit in.\u201d She reported her use of marijuana was dependent on what was going on in her life. She\napproximated her use at 2-4 times per month. Her husband purchased the marijuana for their use\nspending $25 to $50 per month. She preferred marijuana to alcohol because it did not give her a\nhangover and it made her feel \u201chappy go lucky.\u201d   Her husband still smokes marijuana at home.\n7\n8\nOn March 2, 2002, Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana.  She, her husband\n9\nand a friend went to a bar for the evening. On their way home they went through a routine road\nblock. A police officer pulled them over and after smelling marijuana, found a small amount under\nthe passenger seat in a mint tin. Applicant was driving the vehicle. No one in the car admitted to\nownership of the marijuana. Applicant was fined for possession of a controlled substance in a\nmoving vehicle. She pled guilty and was fined $500.10\nWhen Applicant completed a security clearance application in October 2006, she answered\n\u201cno\u201d to Section 24: Your Use of Illegal Drugs. She acknowledged that she completed the security\napplication while on the job and was rushed. In fact, she emphasized that she would have to put it\naway and continue it when she had to attend to the assembly line. She was adamant that it was an\noversight on her part that she did not check the \u201cyes\u201d block to the question. She completed the\napplication on a computer at work and did not see the completed version. Since she did not have a\ncomputer at home, she had to complete the entire application at work. However, she disclosed the\n2002 marijuana possession charge in Section 23. She reported the marijuana usage to the DSS\ninvestigator when interviewed in 2006.  She stated that she was ashamed of her marijuana use.\nApplicant admitted that she used the marijuana from 1996 until 2006, but denied the underlying\nallegation of falsification. She maintained that it was an oversight and that she did not wish to hide\nanything.  \n11\nApplicant indicated she stopped using marijuana in July 2006, but could not remember the\nexact date. She stopped using the drug because she wants to keep her job. She likes her work and\nwants to advance in the company with her friends. She realizes that she does not have to have drugs\nto have friends. She is willing to be tested for drugs.12\n \nApplicant declares she will never use marijuana again. She understands the ramifications for\nher future. She knows using drugs is illegal. She stated her decision to use marijuana was a mistake.\nAt the hearing, she acknowledged that her husband still smokes marijuana. However, she testified\n\nTr.43.\n13\nAE A (Letter from Applicant\u2019s team leader, dated September 2007).\n14\nId.\n15\n Department of the Navy v.

She also stated that she does not attend any social gatherings with\npeople who smoke marijuana.13\n.\nApplicant enjoys her current position, and is very committed to its success.  She wants to\n14\nadvance in her work. She also wants to continue to work with the same team at her company for the\nforseeable future. However, they are now working in a secure environment and she cannot join her\nco-workers because she does not have a clearance. She used marijuana during the nine years that\nshe has been employed with her company.\nHer prior team leader/ supervisor describes Applicant as an excellent employee. She is a\nhardworking, team player who has demonstrated tremendous work ethic, dedication, and reliability.\nShe is a self-motivated and self-directed worker. She requires little supervision. Applicant is one of\nthe team\u2019s top performers. He recommends her for a security clearance.15\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n16\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n17\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n18\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n Id.\n19\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n20\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n21\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 2002).\n22\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n23\nAG \u00b6 24.\n24\n5\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence.   \n19\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n20\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n21\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n22\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  \n23\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline H of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) The Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgement and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules, and regulations.24\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant used marijuana\nfor a period of more than ten years on a social basis from 1996 until July 2006. Applicant also\nadmitted  using marijuana. She was charged with possession of a controlled substance in March 2002\nand pled guilty. Consequently, Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) AG \u00b6 25(a) (any\ndrug use), and DI DC AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia) apply.\nWith the government\u2019s case initially established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present\nevidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her. I considered the\nDrug Involvement Consideration Mitigating Condition (DI MC) AG \u00b6 26 (a) (the behavior happened\nso long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).\n\nSee ISCR Case NO. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n25\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\n6\nHowever, it does not apply because she was smoking marijuana until July 2006 just before she\ncompleted her security clearance application. After the 2002 incident and while working for her\nemployer, she continued to use marijuana.\nApplicant provided insufficient evidence or explanation to support the DI MC AG \u00b6 26 (b) (a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation. Applicant stated that she values her job and wants to stay with her\ncoworkers. She promises not to use marijuana in the future, and offered to take a drug test. I find\ninsufficient proof of a demonstrated intent.\nApplicant apologizes for her mistakes, and states she will not be influenced by peer pressure.\nHowever, Applicant has not mitigated the drug involvement security concern due to the short period\nof abstinence after a ten-year period of using marijuana. It is premature to grant a clearance at this\ntime. Allegations 1.a and 1.b are decided against Applicant.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nOn October 3, 2006, Applicant, in response, to Section 24: Your Use of Drugs  answered \u201cno.\u201d\nUnder DC PC 16(a), the government established that Applicant omitted a material fact from  answer\nto Section 24. She denies that she deliberately falsified her answer to this section. When a falsification\nallegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an admission,\nstanding alone, does not establish or prove an Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission\noccurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether\nthere is direct or circumstantial evidence regarding an Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time\nthe omission occurred.  For DC PC \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\n25\nrelevant and material facts from an personnel security questionnaire) . . .to apply, the government\nmust establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in her answer was deliberate.\nI do not find that this was a deliberate falsification for the reasons discussed above.  Applicant was\nsincere and candid at her hearing. She was a credible witness. I find in favor of Applicant for personal\nconduct under allegation 2.a.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of\n\n7\ntheir acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits,\ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.\nApplicant was sincere in her demeanor and testimony at the hearing. She acknowledges that\nshe made mistakes and wants to correct them. She used marijuana to fit in socially and now believes\nthat is not necessary. However she stopped using marijuana just before her security application\nbecause she wants to keep her position and move with her friend to a new project. She used poor\njudgment as recent as 2006, despite her conviction and fine of $500 for  marijuana possession in 2002.\nShe admits that her husband still uses marijuana. I do not find sufficient time has elapsed since\nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana use. Applicant has not carried her burden in this case. There is not a\nsufficient period of abstinence from possession and use of marijuana. Even Applicants with an\nexemplary work record may be denied a security clearance because her work performance is not the\nissue in a security clearance case.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. Applicant\u2019s long term and still quite recent lapse in judgment with drugs\nleaves doubt as to her reliability. I have considered her desire to put this behind her, but I conclude\nit is premature to find in favor of Applicant. Despite her good characteristics, she has not met the\nburden to overcome the security concern. It is not clearly consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity to grant a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\n.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Clearance is granted. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 4, \n2006. On May 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines C \n(Foreign Influence) and B (Foreign Preference) for Applicant. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJanuary 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 21, 2007. He answered the \nSOR in writing on May 25, 2007, and requested a hearing before an Administrative \nJudge. DOHA received the request on May 29, 2007. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on June 28, 2007, and I received the case assignment on June 29, \n2007. On July 31, 2007, Applicant\u2019s counsel entered a Notice of Appearance. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on August 15, 2007, scheduling a hearing for October 4, \n2007. Delay in scheduling this case was at the request of Applicant\u2019s counsel due to \nschedule conflicts.  I convened the hearing on October 3, 2007 for the limited purpose \nof taking testimony from one of Applicant\u2019s witnesses, who was only available to testify \nthat day. The case was continued to October 4, 2007, as originally scheduled, and \ncompleted.  \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through \nL, without objection. DOHA received the transcripts of the hearings (Tr.) on October 15, \n2007.1 I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until November 19, 2007, \nto submit additional matters.  On December 14, 2007, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted \nExhibit M, without objection from Department Counsel to the document or to Applicant\u2019s \nlate submission. The record closed on December 14, 2007.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \u00b6 2.c, alleging \nApplicant had an uncle who was a citizen and resident of Israel. Tr. 65-66. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel objected to the motion, arguing that Department Counsel had not shown good \ncause for failing to raise the allegation sooner and that the lack of notice denied \nApplicant the opportunity to prepare to respond to the allegation at the hearing. After \nargument by counsel, I denied Department Counsel\u2019s Motion to Amend. Tr. 66-70. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Israel contained in Exs. I through IX. Tr. 8. Applicant\u2019s counsel \nhad no objection and I took administrative notice of the documents offered by \nDepartment Counsel, which pertain to Israel. Tr. 9-10. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \n \n1 Unless otherwise indicated, references to the transcript (Tr.) refer to the hearing held on \nOctober 4, 2007. \n\n \n3 \n \n \ngovernment reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) \n(listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to Israel \nKorea were derived from Exs.

The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n  \nIn his Answer to the SOR submitted on May 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. , 1.b., 2.a. and 2.b., with explanations. \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old microwave engineer, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since January 2006.  He is a first-time applicant for a security \nclearance and seeks a clearance to enhance his opportunities within his company. \n \nApplicant was born in 1974 in the Ukraine, and is an only child. In 1990, when he \nwas 15 years old, he and his parents immigrated to Israel in order to increase their \nstandard of living and provide a better way of life for the family.

In 1999, Applicant immigrated to the U.S. \nand attended a U.S. college from January 2000 to May 2002, and was awarded a \nbachelor of science degree magna cum laude in electrical and computer engineering. \nHe is currently attending graduate school to earn a master\u2019s degree in electronics, and \nexpects to graduate in December 2008. \n \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2006, and has a current U.S. \npassport. SOR \u00b6 1.a. alleges that Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Israel and \nthe U.S., and SOR \u00b6 1.b. alleges that Applicant possesses a valid Israeli passport until \nJuly 2013. Since the SOR was issued, Applicant surrendered his Israeli passport to the \nIsraeli Consulate in September 2007 and submitted a request to renounce his Israeli \ncitizenship to the Israeli Consulate in May 2007.  Applicant provided documentation \nfrom the Israeli Consulate regarding the renunciation of his Israeli citizenship entitled \n\u201cConfirmation For The Waiver of Israeli Citizenship\u201d dated May 24, 2007.

Applicant is not a citizen of or passport holder of any other \ncountry other than the U.S. \n \nApplicant is married and his wife, like him, was born in the Ukraine.  She became \na naturalized U.S. citizen in October 1997. Applicant and his wife were married in the \nU.S. in May 2002. They recently became parents of their first child, a son born in \nSeptember 2007.

After becoming a U.S. citizen in April 2006, Applicant used \nhis U.S. passport for his 2007 visit to Israel. Tr. 53.  \n \nThe President of Applicant\u2019s company testified on his behalf.  He holds a secret \nclearance and also is the facility security officer. He stated Applicant holds a key \nposition within his company as a microwave engineer and further stated that microwave \nengineers are difficult to find. The President sees the Applicant on a daily basis and \ndescribed him as \u201cdiligent and intelligent,\u201d \u201cvery loyal to both company and to our \nsociety, and . . . a very hard working and thorough individual.\u201d Tr. 16 (Oct. 3, 2007). He \nnoted Applicant is \u201cvery happy to be a citizen of the United States.\u201d Tr. 19 (Oct. 3, \n2007).  Referring to giving up his citizenship status, the President stated, \u201c[Applicant\u2019s]  \nhappy to be a citizen of the U.S. He wants to bring his parents here, to live here and \nmake his life here, bring up his brand new child here.\u201d Tr. 19 (Oct. 3, 2007).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s company President stated that a security clearance is necessary for \nApplicant \u201c. . . to move ahead in his career, to develop test systems that will test some \nof the components that we build that do have classified aspects . . . .\u201d Tr. 21 (Oct. 3, \n2007). The President also submitted a reference letter reiterating his testimony. He \nemphasized in his letter that Applicant has a tremendous work ethic, is trustworthy, and \nis an individual who has tremendous potential as a U.S. citizen, and as a microwave \nengineer who can make a substantial contribution to the U.S. defense effort. AE L. \n \nThe Director of Operations for Applicant\u2019s company testified on behalf of \nApplicant.

Tr. 11-19, AE C. \n \nTwo character witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant.  The first was a \nphysician and the second was a network engineer, who holds a security clearance. Both \nwitnesses are friends of Applicant and his wife and socialize with them on a regular \nbasis. They stated, among other things, Applicant is a dependable, trustworthy, and \nhonest person. Both witnesses recommended Applicant for a clearance. Tr. 19-30.   \n \nApplicant submitted seven reference letters.  The authors included long-time \nfriends, work colleagues, and work supervisors. Collectively, they paint a very positive \npicture of Applicant emphasizing again his high moral character, honesty, \ntrustworthiness, and pride he has in being a U.S. citizen.  AE A through F, AE L. The \nPresident of Applicant\u2019s company submitted an evaluation letter in which he described \nApplicant\u2019s potential as a microwave engineer, value as an employee, and additional \ncontribution Applicant could make to the company and national defense if granted a \nclearance. AE G. \n \nApplicant currently earns $62k per year and expects his salary to increase to \n$70k when he completes his master\u2019s degree in December. When Applicant\u2019s wife \nreturns to work after completing her maternity leave, her estimated annual salary will be \n$67 to $70k per year. All of Applicant\u2019s financial interests are in the U.S., which includes \na home, 401(k) accounts, and checking and savings accounts. He has no financial ties \nto Israel. Tr. 44-45. Applicant emphasized his loyalty to the U.S. He enjoys and \nappreciates his way of life in the U.S. and has embraced being a U.S. citizen and \nexercises his rights as a U.S. citizen to include voting. \n \nIsrael2 \n \n \nThe relationship between Israel and the United States is friendly and yet \ncomplex. Since 1948, the United States and Israel have developed a close friendship \nbased on common democratic values, religious affinities, and security interests. U.S. - \nIsraeli bilateral relations are multidimensional. The United States is the principal \nproponent of the Arab-Israeli peace process, but U.S. and Israeli views differ on various \npeace process issues, such as the control of the Golan Heights, Jerusalem, and the \nWest Bank as well as expansion of Israeli settlements. The United States and Israel \nconcluded a free-trade agreement in 1985, and the United States is Israel\u2019s largest \ntrading partner.  Since 1976, Israel has been the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid.  \nThe two countries also have very close security relations. \n \n \nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy whose prime minister heads the government \nand exercises executive power. Israel has a diversified, technologically advanced \neconomy that is growing at about 5.2% per year. Almost half of Israel\u2019s exports are high \n \n2 The contents of the Israel section are taken in whole or in part from Exs. 1 through IX. \n\n \n6 \n \n \ntech and its major industrial sectors include high-technology electric and biomedical \nequipment. \n \n \nAccording to the Department of State Report on Human Rights, the Israeli \ngovernment generally respects the human rights of its citizens, but there are some \nissues with respect to treatment of Palestinian detainees, conditions in some detention \nand interrogation facilities, and discrimination against Israel\u2019s Arab citizens.  Terrorist \nsuicide bombings are a continued threat in Israel and the U.S. government has received \ninformation indicating that American interests could be the focus of terrorist attacks.  \nAmerican citizens have been urged to exercise a high degree of caution and common \nsense when visiting restaurants, businesses, and other places associated with U.S. \ninterests and/or located near U.S. official buildings. \n \n \nIsrael has given a high priority to gaining wide acceptance as a sovereign state \nand to ending hostilities with Arab forces.  To that end, the Israeli Defense Force has \nclose ties to the United States and in 1983; the two countries established a Joint \nPolitical Military Group which meets twice a year.  Israel and the United States \nparticipate in joint military planning and combined exercises, and have collaborated on \nmilitary research and weapons development.  Commitment to Israel\u2019s security and well \nbeing has been a cornerstone of U.S. policy in the Middle East since Israel\u2019s creation in \n1948, and the two countries are bound closely by historic and cultural ties as well as \nmutual interests. \n \n \nThere are several Issues of concern regarding U.S. relations with Israel.  These \ninclude Israel\u2019s military sales to China, inadequate Israeli protection of U.S. intellectual \nproperty, and espionage-related cases.  In November 1985, Jonathan Pollard (a civilian \nU.S. Naval intelligence employee), and his wife were charged with selling classified \ndocuments to Israel and Mr. Pollard was sentenced to life in prison.  Four Israeli officials \nalso were indicted, although the Israeli government claimed the espionage was a rogue \noperation.  On June 13, 2005, U.S. State Department analyst Lawrence Franklin was \nindicted for the unauthorized disclosure of classified information to a foreign diplomat.  \nHe later pled guilty and was sentenced to a 12-year prison term. It was reported that the \ndiplomat in question was a political counselor at the Israeli embassy. \n \n \nThe theft of sensitive and proprietary information threatens U.S. national security \nin both military and economic terms, and it reveals the intelligence-gathering capabilities \nof foreign governments and foreign companies. Industrial espionage is intelligence-\ngathering \u201cconducted by a foreign government or by a foreign company with direct \nassistance of a foreign government against a private U.S. company for the purpose of \nobtaining commercial secrets.\u201d Industrial espionage is not limited to targeting \ncommercial secrets of a merely civilian nature, but rather can include the targeting of \ncommercial secrets that have military applications, sensitive technology that can be \nused to harm the United States and its allies, and classified information. \n \n \nThe National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s 2000 Report to Congress on Foreign \nEconomic Collection and Industrial Espionage lists Israel as one of the active collectors \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nof proprietary information. The most recent Report, released in 2006, states that the \nmajor collectors have been repeatedly identified targeting multiple U.S. Government \norganizations since at least 1997. Furthermore, Israeli military officers have been \nimplicated in this type of technology collection in the United States. \n \nPolicies \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security or trustworthiness suitability, an \nadministrative judge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d (AG(s)). The AGs include brief \nintroductory explanations for each AG, and provide specific disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions. \n \nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AGs \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n  \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive] information \nwill be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d3 demonstrating, in accordance \n \n3 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nwith the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant \nto produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4 \n \nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. It is \nbecause of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to such \ninformation. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such \ninformation. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this \nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \n  \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) \n \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the Government\u2019s concern regarding Foreign Preference,   \n\u201c[w]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country \nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the Unites States.\u201d \n \n \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n4\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n AG \u00b6 10(a) indicates one condition that raises a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign \ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to:  (1) possession of a current passport.\u201d \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. alleged Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Israel and the U.S. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. alleged Applicant possessed a valid Israeli passport. Applicant was granted \nhis Israeli citizenship when he and his parents immigrated to Israel from the Ukraine to \nIsrael in 1990, and he held an Israeli passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of this disqualifying condition, \nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating \ncondition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n \nThree Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 11 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign \ncountry;   \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority or otherwise invalidated. \n \nAG \u00b6 11(a) partially applies because Applicant derived his citizenship as a result \nof his birth, heritage, and immigration to Israel from the Ukraine. At the point in his life \nthat he moved to Israel and engaged in the attributes of Israeli citizenship, he was too \nyoung to choose between the U.S. and Israel.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and 11(e) fully apply. He not only expressed a willingness to \nrenounce his dual citizenship, but has submitted the necessary paperwork with the \nIsraeli Consulate to formally renounce his Israeli citizenship. Regarding his Israeli \npassport, he surrendered it to the Israeli Consulate. After becoming a U.S. citizen in \n2006, he applied for a U.S. passport, which he used during his most recent visit to Israel \nin 2007.  \n \nAs a result of Applicant\u2019s affirmative steps to mitigate this concern, he no longer \nis a citizen of Israel, and has demonstrated the termination of his Israeli citizenship by \nthe mitigating actions described in AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and 11(e). \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nIf the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent \ncontacts with his parents, who are citizens and residents of Israel. These close \nrelationships with his parents create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation because Israel has an active collection program.  \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying \nconditions primarily as it pertains to Applicant\u2019s contacts and relationship with his \nparents, and his travel to Israel. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nand prove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \n \n \nTwo Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s parents are not associated with or \nconnected with the Israeli Government. Applicant\u2019s parents are in the process of \nimmigrating to the U.S. On the other hand, Applicant\u2019s parents do live in Israel, and he \nhas close emotional ties to them, as evidenced by his frequent telephone calls and visits \nto Israel. With regards to his parents, Applicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of [his parents] and the \ninterests of the U.S.\u201d His frequent contacts with his parents in Israel could potentially \nforce him to choose between the United States and Israel. On balance, he did not fully \nmeet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with his \nparents and siblings] could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. Applicant has lived and studied in the United States the \nlast nine years.  He is completely vested in the U.S. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen \nand his new-born son is a U.S. citizen by birth. His mother-in-law and father-in-law are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens and live in the U.S. Applicant is an only child, and as such has \nno other immediate family members living in Israel. Appellant has developed a sufficient \nrelationship and loyalty to the U.S., as he can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest. He became a U.S. citizen in April 2006. His wife \nbecame a U.S. citizen in October 1997. Applicant spent completed his college degree in \nthe U.S. and is in the process of earning his master\u2019s degree. Applicant has been \nemployed by his defense contractor employer since January 2006 and is very highly \nregarded at work. Applicant\u2019s contacts and linkage to the U.S. are greater than his \nlinkage to Israel. He is heavily vested in the U.S., financially and emotionally. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                                          \ncircumstances.\u201d5 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the \neighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.6 In addition to the \neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense \ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.     \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to Israel. He lived in Israel for a significant portion of his formative years. \nHe was initially educated in Israel, and served in the Israeli military. His parents are \ncitizens and residents of Israel. He has frequent, non-casual contact with his parents \nliving in Israel. Applicant traveled to Israel five times since 1999.  He held an Israel \npassport.  However, he has cut his ties to Israel by renouncing his citizenship, and \nsurrendered his Israeli passport. \n   \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant has lived in the United States for the past nine years, and he has \nbeen a naturalized citizen for almost two years. He has strong ties to the U.S., his wife \nand all of her immediate family reside in the U.S. Applicant chose to complete college in \nthe U.S. and is a successful microwave engineer. He is continuing with his studies as a \ngraduate student pursuing his master\u2019s degree. Although his parents currently live in \nIsrael, Applicant has done everything within his means to bring them to live in the U.S. \nThey will immigrate to the U.S. as soon as the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization \nService processes their applications. His ties to the United States are stronger than his \nties to Israel. He has no financial ties to Israel in contrast to his U.S. financial ties. He \ntook the affirmative step of formally renounce his Israeli citizenship, which exceed the \nrequirements of \u201cexpress[ing] a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d There is no \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007) (citing Raffone v. \nAdams, 468 F.2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). \n \n6 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the \neighth APF apparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. \nBd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for \nexploitation\u201d), but see ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that \neighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n13 \n \n \n                                                          \nevidence he has ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United \nStates.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer\u2019s confidence and trust in him is so high as to warrant \nrecommending him for a clearance. This was clearly demonstrated by his company \nPresident testifying on his behalf. Other company officials wrote letters of support. The \ncompany President has held a clearance over a sustained period of time. Applicant \ntakes his loyalty to the United States very seriously, and he has worked diligently for a \ndefense contractor for two years. His supervisors, family, and friends assess him as \nloyal, trustworthy, conscientious, responsible, mature, and of high integrity. He has an \nexcellent reputation as a friend, family member, employee and U.S. citizen. His \nwitnesses and documentary evidence recommend him for a security clearance. No \nwitnesses recommended denial of his security clearance or produced any derogatory \ninformation about him.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members are not, and never have been, Israeli agents. Israel  \nis a highly developed, stable, democratic republic with a modern economy that has \nsupported the U.S. war against terrorism. Israel is a country that has been and \ncontinues to be friendly with the U.S. for more than 50 years.  \n \nThis case must be adjudged on his own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This Analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \nunder the facts presented that the Israeli government or its agents might exploit or \nattempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s immediate family members in such a way that this U.S. \ncitizen would have to choose between his pledged loyalty to the U.S. and those family \nmembers.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d7 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

In\n1\nview of the detailed response to the FORM prepared by his attorney, which included\nnumerous attachments, it is reasonable to assume that if applicant had made the\npayments, evidence of such payments would have been attached to the response to the\nFORM.\nIn or about 1990, applicant was arrested and charged in Georgia with Driving\nUnder the Influence (DUI). He was convicted and paid a fine.\nIn or about 1992, applicant was arrested and charged in Georgia with DUI. He\nwas convicted of the charge, fined $795.00, and placed on probation for 12 months.\nIn or about March 1999, applicant was arrested and charged in Georgia with DUI.\nHe was convicted of the charge, sentenced to one year in jail (suspended), fined\n$700.00, and ordered to perform community service.\nIn or about June 1999, applicant was arrested and charged in Georgia with DUI.\nHe was convicted of the charge, sentenced to 20 days in jail, fined $1,000.00, placed on\nprobation for a little less than a year, and ordered to perform community service.\nIn about December 2000, applicant was arrested and charged in Florida with (1)\nDUI, (2) Failure to Drive in a Single Lane, and (3) Open Container by Operator. He was\nconvicted of the DUI charge, fined $1,500.00, placed on probation for two years, and his\ndrivers license was suspended. His probation ended in 2002.\nIn June 2007, the State of Florida granted executive clemency to applicant. As\nDepartment Counsel conceded in the FORM, it is reasonable to conclude from this that\napplicant has not had any adverse contact with law enforcement since the 2000 DUI.\nIn response to interrogatories sent to him by DOHA in 2007, applicant stated he\nhas \u201cmade bad decisions and foolish judgments in the past and now that is behind me.\u201d\nHe further stated that he has learned from his mistakes.\n\n3\nApplicant submitted numerous letters from current and former coworkers and\nsupervisors. Applicant is described as an excellent worker by these individuals. \nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n Applicant\u2019s attorney\u2019s statement in response to the FORM that applicant \u201chas resolved any problems that\n2\ncaused the incurring of the large [DISCOVER CD] debt\u201d is not supported by any credible evidence.\n4\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of not paying his\nlarge, unsecured debt to DISCOVER CD.  Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions\nare applicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s DISCOVER CD debt\nis still outstanding. Because no evidence was provided concerning how and why such a\nlarge credit card debt was incurred, and why it has remained unpaid for so long, there is\nno basis to conclude applicant is unlikely to experience further financial delinquencies.2\nThis mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d There is\nno evidence that would support application of this mitigating condition.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. Applicant reached a repayment\nagreement with his creditor in July 2008. If he had offered any credible evidence that he\nmade the agreed-upon payments, this mitigating condition might have been applicable.\nBut with no such evidence, it is not applicable.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d This mitigating\ncondition is not applicable for the same reason Paragraph 20.c. is not applicable.\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in Paragraph 21 of the\nAG, and is as follows:\n\nApplicant\u2019s attorney\u2019s statements in response to the FORM that \u201cafter [applicant\u2019s] last arrest in 2000, [he]\n3\nentered a program for the purpose of ridding himself of this addiction,\u201d and \u201cin the ensuing eight (8) years\n[applicant] has eliminated alcohol from his life . . .,\u201d are not supported by any credible evidence.\n5\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise a security concern. Under\nParagraph 22.a., \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 22.c., \u201chabitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d may be\ndisqualifying. Applicant\u2019s history of consuming alcohol to excess and five DUI\nconvictions requires application of these disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 23 of the AG sets out potentially mitigating conditions. Under\nParagraph 23.a., it may be mitigating if \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d Applicant was arrested for and convicted of DUI five times between\n1990 and December 2000. Because over six years elapsed between his second and\nthird arrests, the passage of time since his last DUI (almost eight years) is insufficient by\nitself to safely conclude his alcohol abuse will not recur. Since applicant offered no other\nevidence that would support a finding that he is unlikely to consume alcohol to excess in\nthe future (e.g., alcohol counseling, abstinence),   this mitigation condition is not\n3\napplicable.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in Paragraph 30 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 31.a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s multiple DUI convictions raise this\ndisqualifying condition.\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. Under Paragraph 32.d., it may be mitigating if \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d Applicant\u2019s criminal\n\n6\nconviction occurred about eight years ago, he has shown remorse, and he has offered\nnumerous character reference letters, which describe him as a dependable and\nhardworking employee. These facts support application of this mitigating condition.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man with a\nlong history of alcohol abuse and one significant financial delinquency. His alcohol\nabuse, as evidenced by his five DUI convictions, was frequent and serious. Although\nthe passage of time since his last alcohol-related incident is a factor in his favor, he\noffered no positive evidence of rehabilitation or permanent behavioral changes that\nsupport a conclusion his abuse of alcohol is unlikely to recur. With respect to his\nfinancial delinquency, applicant provided evidence of a repayment agreement, but no\nevidence that he followed through with it. This unsecured debt is rather substantial, and\ngiven the fact applicant ignored it for so long - even after he knew the Government was\nconcerned about it - it is reasonable to assume that he is not financially able to satisfy it.\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guidelines F and G.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline G: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  FOR APPLICANT\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn September 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 7, 2008. She did not state whether \nshe wanted a hearing before an administrative judge or the case decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. The case was scheduled for a hearing, during which \nApplicant specifically stated that she wanted a hearing. The case was assigned to \nApril 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nanother administrative judge on March 4, 2009, and reassigned to me on March 11, \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 17, 2009, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on April 7, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 8, which were received without objection. The Government also offered a \ndemonstrative exhibit which was marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified on \nher own behalf, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were received without \nobjection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional information. \nApplicant submitted four pages of documents, which were marked AE F through H, and \nadmitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum is marked HE II. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 15, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked in \nthe defense industry for more than 22 years and has maintained a security clearance \nthroughout her employment. She has a Bachelor of Science degree awarded in 1986. \nShe has been married for more than 20 years. She has two children, ages 16 and 13.1  \n \n \nApplicant has had financial problems for a number of years, and some of her \ndebts became delinquent. She owed the Internal Revenue Service for taxes due from \nabout 2000. With interest and penalties, her tax debt was more $25,000. Funds were \nwithheld from her paycheck for several years and the debt was paid in 2005. She is now \ncurrent on her taxes. Her husband was unemployed from September 2003 through \nDecember 2003, and again from September 2008 through January 2009.2 \n \n \nApplicant contracted with a credit repair company in about 2006 or 2007 to \naddress \u201cdiscrepancies on her credit report.\u201d Several items were deleted from her credit \nreport. She was told that she did not have to pay any of the debts that were no longer \non her credit report. She contracted with a different credit counseling company in \nNovember 2008. This company reinforced the position that she did not have to pay any \ndebts that were not on her credit report.3  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts totaling $18,090. Applicant admitted to \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, and denied the remaining three allegations. The debts were denied because \nthey no longer appeared on Applicant\u2019s credit report. Individual debts are addressed \nbelow. \n \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a, which alleged a \ndelinquent debt of $9,498. Applicant denied the debt because her credit counseling \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 26, 30-33, 48. \n \n2 Tr. at 21-23; GE 1-5, 8. The IRS debt was not alleged as a basis for the denial of Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance in the SOR and will not be used for disqualification purposes. The debt and Applicant\u2019s \npayment of the debt will be used in assessing Applicant\u2019s total financial picture; in the application of \nmitigating conditions; and in evaluating the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n3 Tr. at 22, 24, 28, 36, 45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-7; AE A, B, E, H. \n\n \n3 \n \ncompany told her that she was no longer responsible for the debt because it was not \nlisted on her credit report. She stated that this debt represented the deficiency owed on \nher car loan after the car was voluntarily repossessed. She did not deny that she \nincurred the debt. She was informed at the hearing that there could be security \nconcerns even if the debt does not appear on her credit report. She testified that she \nwould take steps to pay her debts, even if they were not listed on her credit report. She \ncontacted the collection company that currently holds the debt after the hearing. She \nmade arrangements to pay $77 per month on the debt.4    \n \n \nApplicant admitted that she owed the delinquent debt of $7,499 to a collection \ncompany on behalf of a credit card company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. She has a \npayment plan through her credit counseling company to pay the debt. Payments are \ndeposited with the credit counseling company which disburses the funds to the creditor. \nShe made a deposit of $289 in December 2008, followed by monthly deposits of $192 in \nJanuary, February, and March 2009.5    \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a debt of $606 owed to a collection company. The original \ncreditor was a department store. Applicant denied the debt because it was no longer \nlisted on her credit report. She did not deny that she incurred the debt. She contacted \nthe creditor after the hearing and agreed to pay $50 per month, beginning on April 30, \n2009.6    \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the $487 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. This debt was a car \nloan on a car that was repossessed. The monthly payment on the loan was $487. The \ndebt appears on the credit reports of April 28, 2006 and March 5, 2007. Both credit \nreports reflect that the debt was transferred and had a zero balance. The debt is not \nlisted on the later credit reports in evidence. This debt appears to be a duplicate of the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.7    \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation is not perfect, but it is improving. She earns a good \nsalary and her husband is working a temporary job. She is about two months behind on \nher mortgage, but the mortgage company is working with her to bring it current, and has \nnot threatened foreclosure.8  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a letter from her supervisor. He has known and worked with \nher for seven years. He wrote that her character is above reproach; she is totally \ntrustworthy; and never fails to complete every obligation. She has been a very active \nvolunteer for the Girl Scouts for ten years. A senior member of that organization wrote a \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 24-26, 33-38, 44-45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-7; AE A, B, G. \n \n5 Tr. at 38-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-7; AE E, H. \n \n6 Tr. at 25, 40-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-7; AE A, B, G. \n \n7 Tr. at 42-43; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-7; AE A, B. \n \n8 Tr. at 53-55. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nletter on Applicant\u2019s behalf. She praised Applicant as a leader and role model who is \n\u201cpositive, enthusiastic, and always willing to help the individuals she serves reach their \nfull potential.\u201d9  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n                                                          \n9 AE C, D. \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay her obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n\n \n6 \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant still owes three of the debts alleged in the SOR. She is in the process \nof addressing her financial issues, but they are not yet resolved. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable at this time. Her financial issues are at least partially related to her husband\u2019s \nunemployment and underemployment. These qualify as conditions that were outside \nher control. To be fully applicable, there must be a causal connection between the \nunavoidable conditions and the financial problems. AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the \nindividual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant had financial problems \nbefore her husband\u2019s unemployment. She acted responsibly toward the IRS by paying \nthat debt. She only recently began to act responsibly by setting up payment plans for \nher other debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling through the credit counseling company. \nHer largest debt of more than $25,000 to the IRS was not alleged in the SOR because it \nwas paid before the SOR was issued. She credibly testified that now that she is fully \naware of her responsibilities, she intends to pay her remaining delinquent debts. In \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board discussed \nan applicant\u2019s burden of proof under these mitigating factors: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u201c . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can \nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd. \nApr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually \n\n \n7 \n \npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the \nSOR. \n \nI find that there are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being \nresolved and are under control, and that she has made a good-faith effort to repay her \ncreditors. AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable. AG \u00b6 20(d) is partially applicable. She does not yet \nrate full credit under mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d) because of the delay in addressing \nthe debts that fell off her credit report. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to the SOR \u00b6 1.d debt, because it is a duplicate of the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \nbeen employed in the defense industry and maintained a security clearance for more \nthan 20 years. She is very highly regarded by her employer and as a volunteer in her \ncommunity. She has suffered financial difficulties for a number of years. She had a very \nlarge IRS debt. It took a number of years, but the debt was paid and she is current on \nher taxes. Her husband had periods of unemployment and underemployment. She \nentered into a payment plan to repay one of her delinquent debts. She followed the \nadvice of the professionals and did not pay the debts that were no longer listed on her \ncredit report. She now understands the ramifications of that advice and entered into \npayment agreements with her remaining two creditors. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances are not perfect. She paid a very large debt to the IRS, but \nstill has debts to pay. However, she credibly testified that she intends to pay her \ndelinquent debts. As noted above, the Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not \nrequired to establish that she has paid every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required \nis that an applicant must demonstrate that she has \u201cestablished a plan to resolve [her] \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d10 I find that she \nhas established a plan to resolve her financial problems and has taken significant action \nto implement that plan.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s lingering financial delinquencies and his falsification of his security clearance\napplication generate security concerns that he failed to mitigate at the hearing. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended. He answered the SOR on June 6, 2007, denying all of the allegations\nexcept SOR subparagraph 1.e, and requested a hearing.\n\nTr.47.\n1\nTr. 16.\n2\nExhibit C, Credit Counseling Statement, dated August 28, 2007. \n3\nTr. 56.\n4\nSee note 3.\n5\nTr. 19; Exhibit F.\n6\nTr. 20.\n7\nExhibit H.\n8\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on July 23, 2007. On August 13, 2007,  DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing scheduling it for September 11, 2007. During the hearing, I received three government\nexhibits, one Applicant exhibit, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record\nopen for him to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, he submitted seven additional\nexhibits. DOHA received the transcript on September 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old married man with four adult children. He is a United States Air\nForce veteran who served from 1978 through his retirement in 1998. He is a Gulf War veteran.1\nCurrently, he works as a technical support engineer. His duties are to provide training to military\nclients regarding the operation of missile systems that his employer develops.2\nApplicant was unemployed approximately six months after retiring from the Air Force.\nSubsequently, he began to fall behind on his credit card bills. By 2003, he had credit card debt in\nexcess of $45,000.  Later that year, he retained a credit counselor to help him develop a payment\n3\nplan.  To date, he has satisfied $43,112 of debt through the plan.  \n4\n5\nThe SOR lists six delinquent debts in the approximate amount of $18,141. It includes two\nphone bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b), and four credit card bills. Subparagraph 1.c is the only\nSOR delinquency included in the payment plan. Applicant either had not incurred the debts listed\nin the other SOR subparagraphs when he entered the payment plan, or they were not then delinquent.\nApplicant satisfied SOR subparagraph 1.a.  Although he disputes SOR subparagraph 1.b, he\n6\nprovided no evidence of having notified the creditor.  He is current on SOR subparagraph 1.d.\n7\n8\n\nTr. 30.\n9\nTr. 22.\n10\nAnswer at 3.\n11\nTr. 35.\n12\nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing, Questions 28a, and 28b. \n13\nTr. 39.\n14\n3\nApplicant opened the account listed in subparagraph 1.e in 1994. It grew delinquent after he\nretired from the military in 1998.  The creditor contacted him in 1999 and proposed a settlement.\n9\nApplicant was unable to settle it then, and it was delinquent in 2003 when he entered the payment\nplan.  Currently, the credit counseling agency is negotiating a settlement.  He did not attempt to\n10\n11\nresolve this debt any sooner because he has spent much of the past eight years working overseas.\nWhen he periodically talked to his wife, he never asked about it because he did not consider it to be\n\u201cof any importance.\u201d12\nApplicant alleges he satisfied SOR subparagraph 1.f. He provided no documentation.\nIn March 2006, Applicant completed a security clearance application. He was required to\ndisclose whether he had ever been more than 180 delinquent on any debts, and whether any debts\nwere currently more than 90 days delinquent.  He did not disclose SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.e.\n13\nApplicant was unaware that the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b was on his credit report at the\ntime he completed the application. He disputes it. He alleges that subparagraph 1.e had been\n\u201cbehind\u201d since 1999, but never delinquent.14\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005 and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2)the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the age of the\napplicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n15\nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b618.\n16\n4\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n15\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\n\u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\u201d  Here, Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of\n16\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts, FC DC 19 (c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, and FC DC 19(e):\nconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness,\nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started with his six-month unemployment experienced after\nretiring from the Air Force in 1998. However, he has been working steadily for the past nine years,\nand his debts remain outstanding. Also, although he has been receiving counseling for his financial\nproblems since 2004, and has satisfied $43,000 of debt since that time, the only SOR debt included\nin the payment plan was subparagraph 1.c. The largest and oldest delinquency (subparagraph 1.e)\nremains unresolved. Moreover, although Applicant satisfied SOR subparagraph 1.a, and is now\ncurrent on SOR subparagraph 1.d, he failed to provide documentation of his dispute with the creditor\nlisted in subparagraph 1.b, and did not provide documentation that he satisfied subparagraph 1.f, as\nalleged. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances, FC MC 20(c): the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem, and FC MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, apply, but have limited probative value. I\nconclude subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d are mitigated, while the remainder continue to present a\nsecurity concern.\nPersonal Conduct\n\nAG \u00b6 15.\n17\n5\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  Here, Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the\n17\ndelinquencies listed in subparagraph 1.b and 1.e, as required on the security clearance application\ntrigger the issue of whether Personal Conduct (PC DC) 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities, applies. \nApplicant was unaware the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b was on his credit report\nwhen he completed the security clearance application, therefore, I conclude he did not intentionally\nomit it. Conversely, given the age and amount of SOR subparagraph 1.e, I did not find his\nexplanation for its omission credible. PC DC 16(a) does not apply to the omission of subparagraph\n1.a, but applies to the omission of subparagraph 1.e without mitigation.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant deserves credit for initiating and adhering to a debt repayment plan. However, only\none of the SOR debts is included in the plan. Moreover, his explanation for not having begun to\ninitiate payments toward the satisfaction of SOR subparagraph 1.e was not persuasive in light of the\nlength of time it has been delinquent. This problem was compounded by his unpersuasive\nexplanation for failing to list it on the security clearance application. The lack of credibility displayed\nin omitting this delinquency undermined the persuasiveness of his unsupported contention that he\nhad either satisfied the remaining SOR debts or disputed them. Evaluating this case in the context\nof the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant has made commendable progress in debt\nreduction, but it is not sufficient enough to overcome the financial considerations security concern\ngiven the age and amount of the remaining debts, and the personal conduct security concern\ngenerated by his security clearance application falsification. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not\nattain the state of reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security clearance. The\nawarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the\nfactors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under the Applicant\u2019s current\ncircumstances, a clearance is not recommended, but should he be afforded an opportunity to reapply\nin the future, having paid delinquent obligations and continued to comply with the payment plan, he\nmay well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. However, a clearance at this\ntime is not warranted. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n6\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

HOWE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCaroline H. Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 45 years old, married with two sons, and works for a defense contractor as a\nlaboratory technician.  His wife lost her job and was unemployed for two years until 2007. The loss\nof her income caused financial difficulties, including an inability to repay six delinquent debts\ntotaling about $16,000.  Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concern.  Clearance\nis granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On July 26, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on  December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant answered the\nSOR in writing on August 14, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 29, 2007.  On September 19, 2007, I convened a hearing to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted\ninto evidence, including three exhibits submitted by Applicant after the hearing date but described\non the record when he did not have copies available at the hearing.  DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on September 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations, except for Subparagraph 1.c. which he denied.\nHis admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the\nevidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 45 years old, married with two children, and works for a defense contractor as\na laboratory technician.  He started work there in January 1997, and has worked there continuously\nsince 1997.  Applicant also served in the Navy for nine years.  In the Navy he had a security\nclearance and was on the personnel reliability program for five years. (Tr. 10, 26, 40, 41; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant has six delinquent debts totaling approximately $16,000.  Applicant earns about\n$53,000 annually.  His wife worked regularly until two years ago, when she lost her $33,000 annual\nsalaried job.  Since then, she worked sporadically, and in September 2007, began a new job paying\n$25,000.  While she was unemployed, Applicant could not afford to pay the mortgages on his two\nrental houses.  He lives in a third house on which the monthly mortgage payment is $1,700.  One\nrental house was sold at auction after a mortgage foreclosure.  The delinquent debts in\nSubparagraphs 1.d. and 1.f. ($8,461 and $7,247, respectively) pertain to the same rental property.\nApplicant has not paid anything on those delinquent accounts recently because he claims his salary\nalone is insufficient to allow him to pay them, his monthly financial obligations, and his son\u2019s\ncollege tuition.  However, after totaling his monthly expenses and comparing them to his income and\nhis wife\u2019s additional income, he will have about $1,000 monthly with which to pay debts.  His\nfinancial statement submitted in April 2007, to the Government investigator shows no income for\nhis wife and a negative balance monthly of $114.  This financial statement is now outdated.\nApplicant\u2019s cars are fully paid for now. (Tr. 10, 19, 21-30, 35, 36; Exhibits 1-6, A, C, Answer)\n\n3\nIn the week before the hearing, Applicant paid the delinquent debts listed in Subparagraphs\n1.c. (cell telephone bill for $297) and 1.e. (telephone service provider for $246). (Tr. 15, 40; Exhibits\n2-6, A, C)\nApplicant has not paid the delinquent medical services debts listed in Subparagraph 1.a.\n($210) and Subparagraph 1.b. ($288), but committed to doing so when he has the money available.\nApplicant has health insurance through his employer.  He assumed the insurance company paid those\nbills.  His company has changed medical insurance carriers several times in the past five years, and\nhe admitted he should have checked on the status of those debts before the present time.  He asserts\nhe may not have been aware of these debts existing before now. (Tr. 19-21, 37, 40, 41; Exhibits 3-6)\nApplicant is trying to sell his four-year-old motorcycle.  He hopes to obtain $10,000.  He\nintends to use the money to pay the four unpaid delinquent debts listed in the SOR. (Tr. 34, 38)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\n\n4\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. AG \u00b618\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations:  Applicant incurred about $16,000 in delinquent debt in 2005\nafter his wife lost her job.  Of the six delinquent debts listed in the SOR, two pertain to mortgage\narrearage, and the remaining four debts are each less than $300.  The Disqualifying Conditions (DC)\nthat apply are AG \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and AG \u00b619.c. (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations).\n\n5\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s financial situation was aggravated by his wife\u2019s unemployment status\nfor two years from 2005 to 2007.  Now he has repaid two debts, and has two small debts remaining,\nplus the two mortgage accounts on his one rental property.  Applicant has sufficient income with his\nwife working to repay the two small debts, which he committed to do when he obtains the additional\nfunds.  However, he will need more time to resolve the arrearage on the mortgage accounts.  When\nhe sells his motorcycle, he intends to use the cash to resolve these debts substantially.  The\nMitigating Conditions (MC) which apply are AG \u00b620.b (the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances), AG \u00b620.c. (there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control), and AG \u00b620.d (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d \u00b6 2(a). In evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the \u00b6 2(a).\nI considered all the variables regarding his debt problems.  I considered the size of the debts,\ntheir nature, and the amount, and his wife\u2019s subsequent unemployment after they were obligated on\nthe mortgage payments.  I also considered that he has not incurred any recent debt he cannot repay\non a monthly basis, and is working to repay the four remaining debts.  He repaid two of the small\ndebts which were less than $300 each.  Now he can use his wife\u2019s income to resolve the two small\ndebts, and work with the mortgagees to repay the arrearage on the mortgage accounts.  \nBased on his acceptance of responsibility for the debts, his payment of two debts, his\ncommitment to repay the four debts, and current family income, I do not find a potential for coercion,\npressure, exploitation, or duress, nor a likelihood the past spending pattern will recur.  Applicant was\ncredible, straightforward, and honest in his presentation of his evidence.  His evidence was\npersuasive and he met his burden of proof regarding the MC.  Applicant is aware of the\nconsequences of further financial mismanagement may have on his employment.\nTherefore, I conclude the financial considerations security concern for Applicant.  I also\nconclude the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d analysis for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\n\n6\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

She did not\n7\nprovide information as to whether she has actually been tested in this regard. She stated in her July\n2006 answer to the SOR that she has not used marijuana \u201cin nearly a year.\u201d She also stated she has\na \u201cnew found respect for the laws prohibiting its use.\u201d She stated she is a different person now with\na new set of priorities. She does not intend to use drugs in the future.  In response to interrogatories,\n8\nApplicant was asked if she associated with persons who use illegal substances or frequent places\nwhere she believes illegal substances are being used or are used in her presence. Her response was\n\u201cI am still in college. No matter what social scene I go to, there are probably drugs (usually in\nprivate, unknown to me). Marijuana is especially prevalent. Also, I am an avid concert-goer, where\nsmoking definitely takes place.

He characterizes her as a reliable, hardworking, self-sufficient, respectable student and\ncitizen. Due to her civility and leadership, she was elected president of the college\u2019s chapter of a\nprestigious engineering society. She has helped motivate other students in their professional\ndevelopment, volunteered to help start a chapter of the society at another college, and has gained the\nrespect of her classmates and professors.  Applicant\u2019s supervisors while she was employed describe\n11\nher as confident, capable, intelligent, responsible, detail-oriented, and highly motivated. She is a fast\nlearner, clear communicator, who worked well independently, and her work product was exceptional.\nShe was able to understand complex problems and worked with little guidance. She was impressive\nin planning, analyzing data and overcoming problems throughout the projects. She was given two\nexcellence awards during a twelve week tenure. Applicant was considered professional , courteous\nand very personable.12\nPOLICIES\n\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n13\nId. at 527.\n14\nExec.

It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n19\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.20\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less\n21\nthan a preponderance.\u201d  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven\n22\nconduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.23\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.

Dec. 19, 2002)\n25\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Guidelines \u00b6 2(b).\n26\nDrug abuse is defined in the Adjudicative Guidelines 24 (b): drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of\n27\na legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n5\nor continue his security clearance.\u201d  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\n25\non the side of denial.\u201d26\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below. \nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nDrug Involvement\nDrug involvement is security concern because use of an illegal drug or misuse of a\nprescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nI have considered all of the Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) and\nespecially considered DI DC 25(a) (any drug abuse ) and 25 (d) (illegal drug possession, including\n27\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug\nparaphernalia). Applicant admitted she used illegal drugs from June 2003 through September 2006.\nIn order to use illegal drugs she had to possess them. I find both disqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered all of the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) especially\nconsidered DI MC 26 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), DI MC 26 (b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse\nay drugs in the future, such as: (1) (disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)\nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of\nabstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation). Applicant stated she last used illegal drugs in September 2006. Her last use occurred after\nshe applied for a security clearance. She also admitted using drugs while she was employed by a\nfederal contractor. Applicant is obviously a smart young woman with unlimited career potential. She\nrefers to her use of ecstacy as a one-time error in judgment. She makes no reference to the 50 other\n\n6\ntimes she used marijuana and her judgment in this regard. She stated her \u201croad to abstinence began\nin 2004.\u201d She confuses abstinence, which is to refrain from doing something, from perhaps her\nreduction in consumption. Either she abstained from using illegal drugs or she did not. She admitted\nshe did not. It has been barely a year since her conversion to abstinence. She admits she still\nassociates with peers who use drugs, but does not feel the need to join in. It does not appear that she\nappreciates the illegality of their conduct and the risk she takes by being with them. She did not offer\nany evidence that she intends on avoiding places where drugs are used, or avoiding peers who use\ndrugs, rather she sees this as a part of her college life that apparently she believes is unavoidable.\nApplicant remains part of the culture that accepts illegal drug use and she is passive to the illegality\nof drug use by her peers. Applicant is either unable or unwilling to extricate herself from the people\nand places where drugs are prevalent. Because she has signed a statement that she is willing to have\na security clearance automatically revoked if she uses illegal drugs and her recent commitment to\nabstaining from their use, I find that DI MC 26 (b) partially applies. \nI have also considered the amount of time that has elapsed since Applicant stated she has\nabstained from using drugs, along with the circumstances of her use, and her environment. Although\nit appears that Applicant is moving along in the maturation process and now realizes her actions can\nhave serious ramifications, I find that under the circumstances, not enough time has elapsed to prove\nthat she is truly committed to abstinence and that she can avoid the peer pressure of those with whom\nshe associates and use drugs. Applicant may now be truly committed to abstinence, but she was still\nusing drugs after she applied for a security clearance. She was aware when she filled out her security\nclearance application that illegal drug use was a concern. Despite that and for whatever reason she\ncontinued her use of marijuana. She was a valued employee who was respected by her supervisors,\nbut while working for them, she used ecstacy, an illegal drug. Applicant\u2019s judgment and maturity\nraise serious security concerns. Although she has a made a commitment to abstain from illegal drug\nuse, it is still unclear whether she has reached a maturity level that she can maintain and make good\ndecisions without succumbing to the college atmosphere that she described. I find not enough time\nhas elapsed to show a sustained maturity level and commitment to abstinence. Under the\ncircumstances and at this time, I can not find that her actions are unlikely to recur and not enough\ntime has elapsed since her last drug use. Therefore, I find DI MC 26 (a) does not apply. Although\nI find DI MC 26 (b) partially applies it is not enough to overcome the security concerns raised. \nThe Whole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the\nGuidelines, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the\nGuidelines to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\n\n7\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nand surrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence\nor absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative,\nthe Guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nI considered all evidence provided and considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I considered Applicant\u2019s age\nand maturity and the circumstances surrounding her participation in using illegal drugs. I considered\nhow often she used them and when she used them in relation to her security clearance application\nand while employed. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H\nand evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to\nmitigate the security concerns raised by the drug involvement concerns. Therefore, I am persuaded\nby the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guideline H is decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\nDrug Involvement (Guideline H)\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SCA), on May 1, 2006.\nOn July 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn July 10, 2007, DOHA sent a five-step instruction attachment (Item 2) with the\nSOR, explaining that Applicant write an answer to each subparagraph and paragraph of\nthe SOR. In her answer dated July 28, 2007, she complied with the instructions, except\nshe did not write an answer to subparagraph 2.a. of the SOR. Because she did not\nanswer subparagraph 2.a., she was instructed by mail on August 9, 2007, (Item 4) to\nanswer each paragraph and subparagraph of the SOR, specifically subparagraph 2.a.\nFebruary 6, 2008\n\n These numbers could be the numerical number of the check she purportedly used to pay the debt. No\n1\nadditional information was provided to indicate what the numbers mean. \n2\nShe furnished a second answer on August 26, 2007, and complied with the instructions,\nexcept she again did not write an answer to subparagraph 2.a. A copy of the\ngovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on October 19, 2007. Applicant received the FORM on\nOctober 30, 2007. Her response was due on November 29, 2007. No response was\nreceived. The case was assigned to me on January 28, 2008. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThere are eleven allegations under the financial considerations guideline.\nApplicant supplied two answers. In her first answer, she denied subparagraph 1.b. only.\nIn her second answer, she denied subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.d. Also, neither answer\nprovides a reply to the personal conduct allegation under paragraph 2.\nIn a supplemental statement of her first answer to the SOR, Applicant, to her\nanswer, indicated she was willing to resolve her debt \u201cif there is someone that can help\nme to consolidate my debt and set up a payment plan.\u201d She stated she was willing to do\nwhatever was required to repay the debts. However, she wanted to have the debt\nidentified in subparagraph 1.h. treated as a joint debt. \nApplicant is 44 years old and employed by a defense contractor. She is currently\nseparated. She seeks a security clearance. \nFinancial Considerations\nOn March 12, 2007, DOHA sent Applicant a series of questions (GE 7,\ninterrogatories) related to her delinquent debts. The purpose of the questions was to\nlearn of any action taken by Applicant to address the debts. Applicant provided\nresponses on April 24, 2007. The first question directed Applicant to provide the current\nstatus of 12 of the 14 debts listed in the SOR. Underneath the creditor list is an\nexplanation of appropriate documentation, including (1) a statement from the creditor\nsetting forth the status of the debt, (2) statement from loan consolidation or debt\nmanagement firm indicating accounts in plan and status, and (3) front or back copies of\ncheck instruments confirming debt and date paid. Applicant wrote responses next to\neach one of the creditors/collection entries. In her responses, she indicated she could\nnot reach some creditors while claiming she had established a payment plan with\nothers. Next to the creditors identified in subparagraphs 1.d. and 1.i. of the SOR, she\nwrote that she paid them and included numbers  next to her written responses. No\n1\nsubstantiating documentation verifying the debts were actually paid, was furnished\nhowever. \n\n3\nThe second question of GE 7 directed Applicant to obtain and submit a credit\nreport addressing any adverse information. Applicant submitted a credit report dated\nApril 24, 2007. The report discloses most of the delinquent accounts listed in the SOR. \nApplicant also complied with question 3 of GE 7 by filling out a personal financial\nstatement (PFS), a one-page form indicating in chronological order, monthly income,\nmonthly expenses, debts, monthly remainder, and assets. Applicant reported her\nmonthly net income was $2,663.74, her monthly expenses were $950.00, and her\nmonthly debt payments of $200.00. Applicant did not write in her net remainder. To\ndetermine her net monthly remainder, I subtracted her monthly expenses ($950.00) and\nher monthly debt payments ($200.00) from her monthly income ($2,663.74). Her net\nmonthly remainder of $1,513.74.\nThe SOR lists eleven debts, mostly credit cards, two medical accounts, and a\nlarge secured personal loan. The total overdue amount is $39,734.00. One of the debts\nbecame delinquent in 2002. Two accounts turned into delinquent debts in 2003. The\nremaining past due debts were converted to a collection or charge off status in 2005,\n2006, and 2007. Even after she received the FORM in October 2007, in which she was\ninformed she could provide evidence about the debts, she chose to provide no\ndocumentation to support her earlier claims of satisfying two of the listed creditors.\nApplicant provided no character evidence from coworkers, family or friends, or evidence\nabout her job performance. \nPersonal Conduct\nOn May 1, 2006, Applicant filled out an SCA. Section 28.a. required Applicant to\nanswer YES or NO to the question, \u201cin the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)? Section 28.b. required Applicant to answer YES or NO to the\nquestion, \u201care you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)? Applicant\nanswered \u201cNO\u201d to both questions. Then, she certified with her signature at the end of\nthe SCA that these negative answers, along with her other entries on the form, were\ntrue to the best of his knowledge. Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR that she submitted on\nJuly 28, 2007, was incomplete because she had not provided an answer to\nsubparagraph 2.a. She was instructed by DOHA to supply an answer to subparagraph\n2.a. In her second answer dated August 26, 2007, she answered all allegations except\nfor subparagraph 2.a. I find subparagraph 2.a. was not answered deliberately because\nApplicant knew she deliberately omitted relevant information about her finances from\nSection 28a. and 28b. of her May 2006 SCA.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG, the\nentire process is a careful thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship is not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-\nthe-clock responsibility. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence\nin individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nInability to pay bills on time places the individual debtor at risk of committing\nillegal acts to generate funds. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nSupplying false information on a form or during an interview represents dishonest\nconduct withing the purview of the PC guideline. \n\n5\nAnalysis\nApplicant has more than $39,700.00 in delinquent debt. There are two medical\ndebts, and the rest are credit cards or loan accounts. Some debts have been delinquent\nfor more than three years, while other debts changed over to a delinquency status in\n2007. Based on the large amount of accrued debt, and a record of not resolving her\ndebts, FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts),\nand FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. The fact that\nApplicant deliberately tried to conceal the debt in May 2006 when she executed her\nSCA suggests she has not been willing to pay the debt. Her representations in April\n2007 (GE 7) of having attempted to contact some creditors or having established a\npayment plan with others indicates she is still willing to disguise her inaction with\ncontinued fabrications. Applicant\u2019s PFS that she filled out in April 2007 reflects a\nsubstantial amount of discretionary income left over every month that Applicant could\nhave used to pay four of the smaller accounts in one payment or in a small number of\npayments. Applicant\u2019s decision to do nothing communicates through inaction an even\nstronger inference of her unwillingness to address her indebtedness in a responsible\nmanner. \nFC mitigating condition (MC) 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s currently reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment) may\napply to excuse financial problems that are substantially dated and occurred under\npeculiar circumstances that are unlikely to recur. Though Applicant provided no\nexplanation for her financial dilemma, the recency of some of the delinquent debts, as\nwell as the cumulative amount of debt, foreclose the applicability of FC MC 20.a.   \nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control, and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances) does not apply. There is no record of any kind of unanticipated event\nthat stopped or hindered Applicant from paying her bills. The fact that Applicant\ncontinued to collect new, delinquent debt without handling her old overdue debt, shows\nshe acted irresponsibly between 2002 and 2007. \nFC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\ncannot be favorably considered as there is no record of counseling or evidence to\ndemonstrate the financial problems are under control. In view of the sizeable, monthly\nremainder that has been available for Applicant to pay off several of the smaller debts in\nthe SOR, FC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) does not apply either. Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k. are\nfound against Applicant.\n\n Although Applicant may not have known that all identified debts under subparagraph 2 were delinquent within\n2\nthe scope of both questions of Section 28 of her SCA, she still was required to answer the questions truthfully\nand to the best of her knowledge. \n The other PC mitigating conditions do not apply.\n3\n6\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nThe concern of this guideline is questionable judgment, a lack of candor, or\ndishonesty during the security investigation. When a person declines to be forthright\nand candid during all phases of an investigation, she clearly exhibits disqualifying\nbehavior. However, occasionally the omission is not deliberate or intentional. The\nomission can occur through negligence where forgetfulness causes a person to omit\ninformation from a security form. Alternatively, the omission can result from not\nunderstanding the question. Another instance in which an unintentional omission can\noccur is where there is a defect in the computer software that prevents an applicant\nfrom inputting the proper information. While I could find that one of these explanations\napplies to Applicant\u2019s omission of her financial history from Section 28a. and 28b. of her\nSCA, there is an inadequate foundation to support any of the proposed explanations.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide a written answer to subparagraph 2.a. can be attributed to\nnegligence or oversight, even though she completed the SCA less than a year earlier.\nHowever, her failure to answer the same question a second time, especially after\nreceiving instructions that indicated she specifically answer subparagraph 2.a.,\nestablishes ample grounds for me to conclude she deliberately did not answer the\nsubparagraph because it is true.  PC disqualifying condition (DC) 16.a. (deliberate\n2\nomission, falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire used\nto determine security clearance eligibility) applies.\nThe only mitigating conditions (MC) available are PC MC 17.a. (the individual\nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts) PC MC 17.c. (the offense was so minor, or so\nmuch time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), PC MC 17.d. (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur), and 17.e. (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress).  Applicant\u2019s continuing denial she\n3\nomitted relevant information from her SCA in May 2006 precludes the application of PC\nMC 17.a. Deliberately concealing 11 delinquent debts from her SCA in May 2006\ncannot be characterized as minor or infrequent. In addition, the intentional falsification\ncontinues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. PC MC\n17.c. is inapplicable. The other mitigating conditions under the PC guideline are not\napplicable. \n\n7\nPC MC 17.d. is not applicable to these circumstances as Applicant has not\nacknowledged she deliberately omitted her dishonest conduct. PC MC 17.e. cannot be\napplied for mitigation until Applicant fully comprehends the folly of her deliberate\nfalsification in May 2006.\nAssuming that Applicant\u2019s omission of his financial history from his SCA in May\n2006 is found to be unintentional, then I would conclude that Applicant exercised bad\njudgment in not explaining her omission of relevant financial information from Section\n28a. and 28b. Her questionable judgment warrants a finding against Applicant under the\nPC guideline. \nApplicant\u2019s various explanations on April 24, 2007 (GE 7), of the status of the\nlisted debts convince me she was sufficiently aware of her old and recent delinquent\ndebts. After placing numbers, i.e., check numbers, next to her claims that she paid two\nof the creditors, Applicant could have easily provided documentation, e.g., a ledger or\nbank statement, showing these debts were satisfied. Instead, the lack of documentation\nundermines her credibility even further. \nWhole Person Concept\nAs explained on page 18 of Enclosure 2 of Directive 5220.6, the decision\nwhether to grant or deny a security clearance depends on a common sense\nassessment of the FC and PC guidelines evaluated in the context of the whole person. I\nhave carefully evaluated both guidelines in the context of the general factors of the\nwhole person. Applicant was 43 years old when she completed her SCA in May 2006.\nLess than a year later, she submitted information about each one of the listed debts in\nher answers to interrogatories. Though she did not recognize a few creditors, she\nseemed to be fully aware of her liability to others. Regarding two accounts, Applicant\nclaimed she had paid the accounts and even entered numbers next to the handwritten\ninformation. Her PFS displays a net remainder that would have allowed her to pay some\nof the past due debt. Instead, the record shows only a statement of her intention to\nenroll in a debt consolidation plan. Applicant\u2019s current financial problems and her\ndeliberate effort to conceal them has not been mitigated.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified his June 2006 electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-QIP) by denying that he was over 180 1 days delinquent on any debts within the last seven years, and that he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts (SOR \u00b6 2.a). In his Answer (Item 3), Applicant admitted most of the debts. He denied the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.l, and did not respond to SOR \u00b6 1.p concerning a telephone debt of $316. He attributed his financial problems to health issues in his family, including his prostate cancer, over the past 10 years, but averred he was working hard to take care of his bills. He indicated that a hospital debt of $1,216 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was being repaid at $50 every two weeks. As for his failure to list his debts on his e-QIP, Applicant indicated without explanation that he did not understand the questions.

O\u2019Brien, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (e-QIP) on June 26, 2006.\nOn September 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F and Guideline E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 25, 2007. He\nanswered the SOR in writing on October 12, 2007, and requested a decision based on\nthe record without a hearing. On November 13, 2007, the government submitted a File\nof Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of nine exhibits (Items 1-9). DOHA forwarded a\ncopy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt.\nNo response was received by the January 11, 2008 due date. On March 13, 2008, the\nApril 22, 2008\n\nThe FORM also includes as Item 5 a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) bearing a copy of the\n1\nsignature page for the e-QIP form dated June 26, 2006. The government alleged Applicant falsified his e-QIP\nbut quoted the questions in their abbreviated form as they appear on the SF 86.\n2\ncase was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Based upon a review of\nthe government\u2019s FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 3),\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleges under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\ndelinquent debt totaling $12,364 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.q). Under Guideline E, personal\nconduct, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified his June 2006 electronic\nquestionnaire for investigations processing (e-QIP)  by denying that he was over 180\n1\ndays delinquent on any debts within the last seven years, and that he was currently over\n90 days delinquent on any debts (SOR \u00b6 2.a). In his Answer (Item 3), Applicant\nadmitted most of the debts. He denied the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.l,\nand did not respond to SOR \u00b6 1.p concerning a telephone debt of $316. He attributed\nhis financial problems to health issues in his family, including his prostate cancer, over\nthe past 10 years, but averred he was working hard to take care of his bills. He\nindicated that a hospital debt of $1,216 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was being repaid at $50 every two\nweeks. As for his failure to list his debts on his e-QIP, Applicant indicated without\nexplanation that he did not understand the questions. After consideration of the\nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 58-year-old married father of two daughters, who are 30 and 17\nyears old, respectively. He has worked for the same defense contractor in various\ncapacities (as laborer, rigger, pumper) since February 1973 and holds a secret-level\nsecurity clearance (Item 1, Item 5, Item 6, Item 9).\nOn June 26, 2006, Applicant completed an e-QIP. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to\nquestion 28a. \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d and question 28b. \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\n(Item 4). A Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) was also completed and it was\nforwarded to the government. The signature form for the e-QIP, which had been signed\nby Applicant on June 26, 2006, was attached to the SF 86. The SF 86 contained\nnegative entries to the financial delinquency inquiries: \u201c28A-LAST 7 YRS, OVER 180\nDAYS DELINQUENT ON ANY DEBTS?\u201d and \u201c28B-CURRENTLY OVER 90 DAYS\nDELINQUENT ON  ANY DEBTS?\u201d (Item 5). It cannot be determined from the record if\nApplicant completed the SF 86 himself or it was prepared by his employer based on\ninformation he submitted on the e-QIP. Applicant certified by his signature on the e-QIP\nthat the statements on the form were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct to the best of [his]\nknowledge and belief and [were] made in good faith.\u201d (Item 4).\n\nThe credit report contains duplicate listings for several of the collection accounts.\n2\n3\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on July 21, 2006, revealed several outstanding\ndebts charged off or placed for collection, and one unpaid judgment of $1,468 awarded\na hospital in November 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). An automobile loan account of $13,610\nopened in September 1998 had been charged off in January 2002 in the amount of\n$1,805 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). In February 2002, Applicant leased a vehicle from another lender.\nHe exceeded the mileage limit (Answer) and in November 2005, the lender charged off\na $4,623 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Several medical providers also referred unpaid balances\ntotaling $1,898 for collection over the period June 2000 to February 2006 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b,\n1.e, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, 1.l). The credit report also disclosed unpaid telephone charges of $61\n(SOR \u00b6 1.m) and $316 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.q, same debt) in collection since November\n2003 and October 2005, respectively. In December 2005, a satellite television provider\nplaced a debt balance of $251 for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.f) (Item 9).2\nIn April 2007, DOHA sent Applicant financial interrogatories, asking him to\ndocument any payments of the debts reported as delinquent on his July 2006 credit\nreport. Applicant furnished recent pay stubs showing a weekly take-home pay with\novertime of $754.61 based on a base hourly rate of $19.89. He also provided a May\n2006 credit report showing new six collection accounts totaling $701 placed with a\nsingle assignee by the county hospital since February 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a $164\ncollection debt for magnetic resonance imaging services delinquent since May 2006\n(SOR \u00b6 1.p), a new radiology debt of $33 assigned in August 2006 increasing the total\ndebt for radiology services to $96 (SOR \u00b6 1.i), and a $355 telephone debt placed April\n2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.o). The recent credit report showed no progress toward resolving the\ndebts that had been previously reported as delinquent. However, Applicant provided\nevidence of satisfaction by credit card on May 22, 2007, of a $50 medical debt owed to\nthe county hospital (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant also submitted a personal financial statement\non which he disclosed miscellaneous expenses of $1,500 for a vacation. Applicant\nreported his monthly expenses and debt payments (mortgage and another loan)\nexceeded his net income (Item 6). \nAt DOHA\u2019s request, Applicant completed another personal financial statement on\nJune 15, 2007. He reported a total net income monthly of $3,224, although the specific\nnet salary figures of $831 for himself and $700 for his spouse do not add up to that\nfigure. He reported lower monthly expenses due to a reduction in utility and medical\ncosts.  Assuming total net income of $3,224 as reported, he had about $208 remaining\neach month. He also indicated he had $500 in savings (Item 7).\nA check with Equifax Information Services on August 30, 2007, showed Applicant\nhad paid $150 of the medical collection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b (including $50 paid by credit\ncard in May 2007). Seventeen medical debts totaling about $1,714 were listed as\ndelinquent, about $1,421 referred for collection since January 2006. Not listed on the\ncredit report is about $1,090 in other medical debt previously reported as delinquent on\nhis consolidated report in July 2006. The credit report does not reflect any payments on\nthe listed judgment debt in SOR \u00b61.a, the automobile debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, or\n\n4\non the $355 telephone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o. Previously reported other non-medical debts\nof $251 for satellite television (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and $316 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.q, same debt)\nand $61 (SOR \u00b6 1.m) for telephone services, do not appear on the latest credit report\n(Item 8).\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are attributable in part to illness suffered by\nhimself, his spouse, and a daughter, which caused bills to pile up. He indicated in\nOctober 2007 that the last ten years have been difficult for him and he would pay the\ndebts as soon as he is able (Item 3).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\n\nDOHA alleged that Applicant owed the hospital $2,093 ($1,216 in SOR \u00b6 1.b, $ 80 in SOR \u00b6 1.h, and $797\n3\nin SOR \u00b6 1.n).  The July 2006 credit report includes unspecified medical debt, some of which may be owed\nthe hospital. The evidence also shows the $50 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is owed to the hospital as well. The total\nmedical debt outstanding amounts to about $2,800 excluding the unpaid judgment that is owed to a different\nhospital.\n5\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquency since about 2000. That\nNovember, a hospital obtained a judgment of $1,468 against him that has not been paid\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a). Over the next seven years, various medical providers placed debt\nbalances for collection totaling about $2,800 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g. 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, 1.n,\n1.p).  Two auto lenders charged off debt balances totaling $6,793 (SOR \u00b6 1.c, 1.d).\n3\nOther non-medical debts totaling $983 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.j, 1.m, 1.o) were referred for\ncollection. Significant security concerns are raised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nApplicant attributes his debts to medical problems suffered by him, his spouse,\nand his daughter (\u201cWe have had so much sickness in our family, everything just got pile\n[sic] up, right behind each other my daughter, my wife, myself.\u201d Item 3). A substantial\nportion of his delinquent debt is medical, so AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies in\npart, but it does not adequately allay the judgment concerns in this case. Applicant has\n\n6\nowed a sizeable court judgment since November 2000. While he indicated he paid on it\n\u201ca while back\u201d before his spouse\u2019s illness (Item 3), there is no evidence of any payments\non the debt. In 2006/07, a county hospital referred six new debt balances ranging from\n$46 to as high as $320 for collection. On June 1, 2007, Applicant reported among his\nmiscellaneous expenses that he spent $1,500 for a vacation. It is not clear if he saved\nor borrowed the funds, but his discretionary expenditure is difficult to justify when so\nmany accounts are in collection status. He did not list any miscellaneous expense on\nJune 15, 2007, but indicated at that time that he had $500 in savings and a net monthly\nremainder of $208. While his repayments since March 2007 totaling $150 on SOR \u00b6 1.b\n($50 by credit card in May 2007) qualify as a good faith effort under AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts\u201d), Applicant remains under a significant debt burden that he has only just begun to\naddress, and there is not enough information about his present financial situation to\nconclude that he will be able to resolve it in the near future.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAs of June 2006 when Applicant completed his e-QIP (Item 4) and the SF 86\n(Item 5), he owed more than $1,500 in medical debt in collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.h,\n1.i, 1.k, 1.l), non-medical debts of about $7,776 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.m, 1.o), and a\ncivil judgment of $1,468 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). These debts should have been reported on both\nforms in response to the financial delinquency inquiries pertinent to debts over 180 days\nwithin the past seven years (section 28a) and to debts currently over 90 days delinquent\n(section 28b). Applicant instead responded \u201cNo\u201d to both questions. Although not alleged\nby the government, the unpaid judgment debt also should have been reported in\nresponse to section 27d concerning judgments not paid in the past seven years.\n \nUnder AG \u00b6 16(a) personal conduct concerns are raised by the \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d Applicant does not contest that he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the debt inquiries,\nbut submits he did not intentionally falsify his clearance application (\u201cI answer [sic] no\nbecause I did not understand the question, I am sorry about the wrong answer.\u201d Item 3).\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for the omissions must be considered, but also assessed in light\n\nAG 17(b) applies where \u201cthe refusal to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly\n4\ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or\ninstructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made aware of\nthe requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully.\u201d AG \u00b6\n17(c) applies where \u201cthe offense is so minor, or such time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\n7\nof the record evidence as a whole. The financial delinquency questions are\nstraightforward. The overwhelming evidence of unpaid debt and Applicant\u2019s admissions\nof known debt (i.e., he started paying on the judgment debt \u201ca while back,\u201d the finance\ncompany sent him a bill for the automobile loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, everything just piled\nup), lead me to conclude that Applicant falsified his clearance application. AG \u00b6 16(a)\napplies.\nIn Applicant\u2019s favor, he responded to DOHA interrogatories by furnishing a\nrequested credit report that discloses a significant amount of unpaid debt. He did not\ndeny much of the debt when he answered the SOR. However, for mitigating condition\nAG \u00b6 17(a) to apply, the efforts to correct the omission, concealment or falsification\nmust be prompt and before confrontation (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith\nefforts to correct the omission, concealment or falsification before being confronted with\nthe facts\u201d). The record suggests the government learned of Applicant\u2019s indebtedness\nthrough its check of Applicant\u2019s credit on July 21, 2006 (Item 9). Although the\ngovernment knew about Applicant\u2019s financial problems promptly, there is no indication\nthat Applicant notified the government of any of his debts before he responded to the\nfinancial interrogatories in June 2007. AG \u00b6 17(a) is not applicable.\nThe government must be able to rely on the representations of those persons\ngranted access, and any lack of candor raises serious doubts in that regard. The record\nis silent about the circumstances under which Applicant completed either the e-QIP\n(Item 4) or SF 86 (Item 5). There is no evidence that Applicant relied in good faith on the\nimproper or inadequate advice of an authorized person, such as security personnel at\nwork or legal counsel (see AG \u00b6 17(b)), or of such unique circumstances (see AG \u00b6\n17(c)) that would negate the reasonable inference of deliberate falsification.4\nFurthermore, while Applicant has apologized for the \u201cwrong answer\u201d (Item 3), he has yet\nto acknowledge the knowing falsity of his responses to the financial inquiries.\nTherefore, I am also unable to apply AG \u00b6 17(d) (\u201cthe individual has acknowledged the\nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps\nto alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d).        \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\n\nApplicant has paid three $50 debts that were assigned for collection in November 2001, October 2002, and\n5\nJanuary 2004 (Item 6, Item 8). He still owes at least the $1,216 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.\nApplicant denies the two debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.l owed to the same assignee. The credit bureaus report the\n6\ndebts as unpaid and Applicant has not disproved his legal responsibility. \n8\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are\ndue in significant part to non-covered medical costs, but this does not relieve him of his\nobligation to deal with his creditors in a responsible manner. As of January 2007, debts\nwere still being referred for collection and most continue to go unpaid. Applicant also\ndemonstrated an unacceptable tendency to put his interests ahead of his obligation of\ncandor, and he has not yet shown that his representations can be completely relied on. I\nam unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for him.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant5\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant6\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\n\nThe July 2006 credit report (Item 9) lists additional medical debt by account number but with no information\n7\nas to the creditor.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 18, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 15, 2011, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 13, 2011. DOHA issued \na Notice of Hearing on April 18, 2011. I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 25, \n \n1 \n \n \nAugust 11, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n2011. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant did not object and \nthey were admitted into evidence. The Government requested administrative notice be \ntaken of Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. I granted the request. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf. He offered Exhibits (AE) A through H, which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant provided his closing statement in writing and it was marked as HE \nII. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 2, 2011.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old. He married in 1982 and has two children, ages 27 and \n24, who were born in the United States. He has worked for a federal contractor since \n2002. He came from Taiwan to the United States in 1982 on a student visa. His wife \ncame from Taiwan to the United States in the same year. They both became naturalized \ncitizens of the United States in 1997.1 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, three brothers, and two sisters-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Taiwan. His father is 80 years old and retired about 13 or 14 years ago, as \nthe secretary of a town council in a small town of less than 10,000 people. He receives \na pension from the city. He lives with Applicant\u2019s older brother. His mother passed away \nin 2002. His older brother and his wife are also retired. His brother worked in the \nmother\u2019s family real estate business. He is 56 years old. He does not receive a pension. \nHis wife has worked as a teacher for approximately 25 years and anticipates retiring in \nthe near future. She will receive a pension.2  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother is 52 years old. He is not married. He also used to \nwork in their mother\u2019s family real estate business. He no longer does and is now \nunemployed.3  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s youngest brother and his wife are both medical doctors. They work in \nthe same hospital. The hospital is semi-private, but it is unclear how the government is \ninvolved with it.4  \n \n \nIn 1998, Applicant sponsored his three brothers for permanent residency status \nin the United States. His two younger brothers declined because they were firmly \nentrenched in their careers and jobs In Taiwan. His oldest brother and his wife paid the \n \n1 Tr. 37-51; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. 29-32, 36. \n \n3 Tr. 32. \n \n4 Tr. 33, 75. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nrequired fees to keep their application open and it was approved, but they have not yet \ndecided whether to immigrate.5  \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Taiwan in October 2001, January 2003, August 2003, \nJanuary 2004, February 2007, February 2008, July 2008, August 2008, and July 2009. \nApplicant\u2019s mother was ill with cancer during this time and later had a kidney transplant. \nApplicant traveled often in 2007 to 2008 to visit her while she was sick. When he was in \nTaiwan, Applicant visited with his father and siblings. He does not maintain any \nfriendships there. Since his mother passed away, Applicant has returned to Taiwan \nonce and anticipated he will return in the future, but presently has no plans. He talks to \nhis father by telephone once every two to three months. He talks to his brothers a \ncouple of times a year. He does not send any of his family money. Except for his \nyoungest brother, his Taiwanese family has not visited him in the United States since \n1994 or 1995. His youngest brother visited about seven years ago when he came to \nstudy at a renowned medical facility. He did additional training at a medical facility \nlocated close to where Applicant lives.6  \n \n \nApplicant does not own property in Taiwan. He does not anticipate inheriting any \nproperty. All of his assets are in the United States and are jointly held with his wife. He \nestimated his residence is worth about $1.1 million. He owns it jointly with his wife and \ndaughter. He has rental property valued at about $280,000. He also owns two time \nshares that are worth about $20,000. He has a 401K retirement plan valued at about \n$200,000. He has some stocks valued between $5,000 and $10,000. He owns three \ncars. His wife works and contributes to a 401K account that is worth about $20,000 to \n$30,000.7 \n \n \nApplicant never voted in Taiwan. He has voted in the United States in every \nelection, including local elections.8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s sister and her family live close to them and are all citizens of \nthe United States. They maintain regular contact with Applicant\u2019s family.9  \n \n \nApplicant has a United States passport and uses it when he travels. He was \nconscripted into Taiwanese military service from 1979 to 1981, and was a \ncommunications officer. He credibly testified that his family, friends, finances, \ncommunity, career, and life are all in the United States. He stated he pledged his loyalty \nto the United States when he became a citizen. He is not loyal to any foreign \n \n5 Tr. 33-36, 77. \n \n6 Tr. 60-63, 70-74, 78-81. \n \n7 Tr. 52-59. \n \n8 Tr. 52. \n \n9 Tr. 59-60. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \ngovernment. He provided copies of awards that were presented to him and his family, \nalong with a letter of recommendation that I considered.10 \n \nTaiwan11 \n \n \nIn 1949, Taiwan was populated by refugees fleeing a civil war in China. That \nsame year, Communists in mainland China established the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), and a separate, independent government was established in Taiwan. The PRC \ndoes not recognize Taiwan, and insists there is only \u201cone China.\u201d \n \n \nTaiwan is a multi-part democracy. Through nearly five decades of hard work and \nsound economic management, Taiwan has transformed itself from an underdeveloped, \nagricultural island to an economic power that is a leading producer of high-technology \ngoods. On January 1, 1979, the United States formally recognized the PRC as the sole \nlegal government of China. The U.S. also announced that it would maintain cultural, \ncommercial, and other unofficial relations with the people on Taiwan. The Taiwan \nRelations Act (TRA) signed into law on April 10, 1979, created the legal authority for the \nconduct of unofficial relations with Taiwan. The American Institute in Taiwan, a private \nnonprofit corporation with offices in Taiwan, is authorized to issue visas, accept \npassport applications, and provide assistance to U.S. citizens in Taiwan. A counterpart \norganization was established by Taiwan. It has multiple offices in the U.S. \n \n \nTaiwan is among the most active collectors of U.S. economic and proprietary \ninformation and there are numerous specific incidents of their attempts to acquire \nexport-restricted products and dual use technology. In addition, the PRC\u2019s Ministry of \nState Security, the preeminent civilian intelligence collection agency, maintains \nintelligence operations in Taiwan, through a bureau utilizing PRC nationals and Taiwan \nconnections.  \n \nMaintaining strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal. The U.S. \ndoes not support Taiwan independence, but does support Taiwan\u2019s membership in \nappropriate international organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), \nwhich it joined in 2002; Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum; and the \nAsian Development Bank. In addition, the U.S. supports appropriate opportunities for \nTaiwan\u2019s voice to be heard in organizations where its membership is not possible. \n \n \nThe TRA enshrines the U.S. commitment to help Taiwan maintain its defensive \ncapability. The U.S. continues to sell appropriate defensive military equipment to \nTaiwan, in accordance with the TRA.  \n \n \nIn response to political developments in Taiwan, the United States dialed back \nsome of its enthusiasm for supporting Taiwan\u2019s initiatives. While still pursuing a close \nrelationship with Taiwan, U.S. officials are balancing criticisms of the PRC military \n \n10 Tr. 25-26, 64-70, 83; AE B, C, D, E, F, G, H. \n \n11 HE I. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nbuildup opposing Taiwan with periodic cautions and warnings to the effect that U.S. \nsupport for Taiwan is not unconditional, but has limits. In January 2010, the White \nHouse Administration notified Congress of its intent to sell various defense weapons to \nTaiwan.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern. I \nhave considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government or owning property in a \nforeign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each \nindividual family tie must be considered.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d12 \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d13 Finally, friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United \nStates, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerability to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, or the \ncountry is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, three brothers and two sisters-in-law are citizens and residents \nof Taiwan. He has offered to sponsor his brothers to move to the United States. His \noldest brother and his wife have completed their applications, but have not decided \nwhether to proceed any further. His father receives a pension from the government. \nApplicant traveled in the past to Taiwan for visits to see his family and anticipates he will \ndo so in the future. These facts potentially create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, and also create a \npotential conflict of interest. Therefore, I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b).  \n \nI have also analyzed all of the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions \nfor this security concern under AG \u00b6 8 and conclude the following are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \n12 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \n13 ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant maintains a relationship with his father and siblings in Taiwan. He \nvisited them and had contacts with them regularly before his mother passed away. He \nintends to visit them in the future. I find AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply because his familial \nrelationships in Taiwan are more than casual.  \n \n \nThe United States maintains close relations with Taiwan. Applicant maintains \nconsistent contact with his relatives in Taiwan. His father receives a government \npension. Except for the pension, his relatives have no other contact with the Taiwanese \ngovernment. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the \nforeign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the U.S. Applicant and his wife have been citizens of the United \nStates since 1997. Their children were born here. They have substantial assets all \nlocated in the United States. They have no assets in Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s has \nrelatives who are citizens and residents of the United States, and live nearby. I do not \nfind Applicant\u2019s relationship with his father, his siblings and their wives, and his visits to \nTaiwan create a heightened security risk. It is highly unlikely, considering Taiwan\u2019s \nrelationship with the Untied States that Appellant would have to choose between loyalty \nto his family in Taiwan and the United States.  \n \nThe United States is the main supplier of military hardware to Taiwan. Taiwan is \nan active collector of U.S. economic intelligence. However, there is no indication that \nthey target or exploit their own citizens to obtain it. Although Applicant\u2019s father receives \na government pension, based on Taiwan\u2019s relationship to the United States, it is very \nunlikely that intelligence officials would attempt to pressure Applicant\u2019s father or his \nbrothers to gather valuable or classified information from the United States through \nApplicant. I find mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 8 (a) and 8(b) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant and \nhis family are firmly entrenched in the United States. He has been in this country since \n1982 and has been a citizen since 1997. All of his substantial assets are located in the \nUnited States. His wife and her family are citizens and residents of the United States. \nAlthough Applicant has some familial ties to Taiwan, I am convinced that he will resolve \nany issues in favor of the United States. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no \nquestions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under \nthe guideline for Foreign Influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Shawn Kapala, Personal Representative\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge\nStatement of Case\nOn July 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under\nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge\nto determine whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 14, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on October 25, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on\nNovember 28, 2007.  A hearing was held on November 28, 2007, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\nJanuary 18, 2008\n\n2\ncase consisted of five exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and 14 exhibits.\nThe transcript (R.T.) was received on December 7, 2007.  \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nPrior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of her stipulated final judgment of marriage dissolution.\nThere being no objection from the Government, and good cause being demonstrated,\nApplicant was granted seven days to supplement the record.  Within the time permitted,\nApplicant furnished (1) a copy of her stipulated final judgment of dissolution of marriage\nand (2) a letter regarding her unsuccessful efforts to obtain a dated copy of the\nbankruptcy court's lifting of its stay of her divorce proceedings. There being no objection\nfrom the Government, and good cause being demonstrated, Applicant's post-hearing\nsubmissions were admitted as Applicant's exhibits O and P.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred numerous delinquent\ndebts: He is alleged to have incurred 12 delinquent medical debts exceeding\n$12,000.00.  For her response to the SOR,  Applicant denied all of the listed debts.  She\nexplained that each of the listed debts were discharged in her completed Chapter 7\nbankruptcy.  She provided explanations regarding her child support withholding order,\nher income/expense chart, and character references.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 32-year-old electronics technician for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married in 1990 and had two children from this marriage.  No longer\nable to live with her spouse following several incidents of domestic violence attributable\nto him, Applicant petitioned for divorce in December 2003 (R.T., at 44).  Her attorney at\nthe time advised her to cease paying her bills pending finalization of the divorce decree,\nbecause she (according to the attorney) would be paying his bills as well (R.T., at\n44-46).\nApplicant followed her attorney's advice and ceased paying her bills.  With the\naid of a stay lift from the bankruptcy court (see ex. J), she was able to complete and\nfinalize her divorce in July 2007 (see ex. O).  Under the decree's terms, Applicant and\nher husband split responsibility for their listed debts.  Each spouse, too, was awarded\nindividual custody of one each of their two children and assigned corresponding child\nsupport for the child living with the other parent.   Once their respective child support\nobligations were netted out, Applicant became responsible for paying net child support\nto her ex-husband in the amount of $163.00 a month (R.T., at 70-71).   \n\n3\nFollowing her divorce, Applicant returned to school and obtained he AA degree in\n2004.  She was hired as an intern in January 2005 by her current defense employer ,\nand has been a full time employee with the company since June 2005.  She received a\nrecent promotion and a pay increase to $19.97 an hour (R.T., at 49).  Current with her\ndebts, she is  pursuing a B.S. degree in engineering at the state university in her\ncommunity (R.T., at 51).   She considers herself a full time student and takes 13 credits\na semester while working full time with her defense employer (R.T., at 51-52).\nBecause her divorce was progressing so slowly in 2004, Applicant's lawyer\nsuggested to her that she seek Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief and coordinate her divorce\nefforts with her bankruptcy lawyer (R.T., at 53).  Each of her listed debts in the SOR is\ncovered by her bankruptcy petition (schedule F) and was discharged in bankruptcy (see\nex. I; R.T., at 61-65).  Albeit, there were several debts listed in the SOR that\nrepresented duplicate accounts (i.e., creditors 1.d and 1.e).   Applicant completed her\nrequired bankruptcy counseling and received her bankruptcy discharge in July 2007 (ex.\nI).   \nApplicant  continues to receive child support from her ex-husband, and still pays\nnet child support to her ex-husband ($163.00 a month net) due to the disparities in their\nrespective incomes (i.e., she makes more than he does).  She has paid her divorce\nlawyer $1,500.00 so far and still owes him $1,700.00 (R.T., at 71).  She paid her\nbankruptcy attorney one lump sum payment of $1,500.00 in full discharge of her fee\nobligations for her bankruptcy (R.T., at 71).\nApplicant is highly regarded by supervisors and coworkers familiar with her work.\nShe is described by her shift supervisor as a professional caring coworker who has\ngained the respect and confidence of all of those who come in contact with her (see ex.\nG).  Her coworkers characterize her  as a hardworking, dedicated technician  who is an\nasset to her customers and her team (ex. G).  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy\nfactors are pertinent herein:\n\n4\nFinancial Considerations\n\"The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts \").\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of\nrecord.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on\nspeculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nApplicant is an electronics technician provider for a defense contractor who\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts during her marriage that ended in divorce in\nJuly 2007.  These  delinquent debts (12 in all that exceeded $12,000.00) were\neventually apportioned between Applicant and her ex-husband in their divorce decree\nand were subsequently discharged in Applicant's bankruptcy.  Because Applicant's\n\n5\nliability remained joint and several for these debts (notwithstanding apportionment of the\ndebts in the divorce decree), she could effectively discharge her legal responsibility for\nthe debts only by paying them herself (in the event her ex-spouse did not), or seek\nprotection through a discharge in bankruptcy (as she did).  Because of their recency,\nhowever, Applicant's debts raise initial security concerns.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially overextended\nthat he or she is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant's\naccumulation of delinquent debts, which heretofore she has not been in a position to\naddress, warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations: and DC 19(a) (\"inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts\") and .DC 19(c)  (\"a history of not meeting financial\nobligations\").\nExtenuating circumstances are associated with the advice she received from her\nattorney about stopping payment of her debts while awaiting the outcome of her\nbankruptcy.  Extenuating, too, are Applicant's limited income from her entry position and\nthe extra burdens imposed on her as a single parent and student.   Her income and\nexpense records reveal that she is meeting her current expenses and debts with her\ncurrent income sources following her bankruptcy discharge, and no longer has any\nsignificant debts.  MC 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline (\"the conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce,\nor separation, and the individual acted responsibility\") has some applicability to\nApplicant' situation.  For the most part, her financial history reflects a young single\nparent struggling to better herself with enhanced educational skills.\n With her limited income and relatively high expenses as a single parent,\nfollowing her initiation of divorce proceedings in 2003, Applicant has not been in a\nposition to make either individual or collective progress (such as use of debt\nconsolidation) on her listed debts.  Faced with no viable alternatives, she petitioned for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy relief in 2004 and received her discharge in July 2007.\nConsidering the extenuating circumstances of Applicant's accumulated debts, the trust\nshe inspires in her work, and  her now completed efforts to discharge her debts through\nCongressionally approved bankruptcy procedures, Applicant essentially eliminates  risks\nof having to generate funds by both legal and illegal means to pay her debts. \nApplicant's documented Chapter 7 discharge is enough to justify application of\ntwo of the mitigating conditions to her financial situation.  MC 20(d) of the guidelines for\nfinancial considerations (\"the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts\") and MC 20(d) (\"the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control\")  have some beneficial application to Applicant's\nsituation in this case.\n\n6\nHolding a favorable security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access information covered by clearance\neligibility requirements is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder\nof the clearance. \nBased on her documented divorce decree and Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge\nof her old debts and the whole person level of trust she has demonstrated in fulfilling her\nresponsibilities at work, gaining college credits, and caring for her family as a single\nparent, Applicant is able to convincingly demonstrate the level of overall personal\naccountability and responsibility necessary to mitigate the Government's security\nconcerns.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant's debt accumulations, the positive judgment and trustworthiness impressions\nshe has made on her friends and colleagues, and her current bankruptcy discharge of\nher listed debts, she mitigates security risk concerns related to her debts.   Favorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by the financial\nconsiderations guideline.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions and guidelines listed above, this Administrative Judge makes the following\nformal findings:\nFINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS: FOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras . 1.a through 1.n: FOR APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.  Clearance is granted.\n                                          __________________________\nRoger C. Wesley\nAdministrative Judge \n",

I make the following findings: Applicant is a 38-year-old senior geospatial consultant for a defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer since January 2006. She received a security clearance in May 2001, while employed by the Department of Justice (Tr. 45).

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFrancisco Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJohn F. Mardula, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nWhen Applicant was laid off in February 2004, she had credit card debt of about $24,353,\nbut no delinquent accounts.  She was seriously disabled during a burglary in December 2004.  She\nhad no financial reserves, because she had incurred uninsured medical expenses of more than\n$27,000 between September 2002 and December 2004.  While unemployed, her credit card debt rose\nto more than $62,000 and became delinquent.  After returning to work in January 2006, she paid off\n$7,700 in personal loans from friends, reduced her credit card debt to about $47,000, and adopted\na plan to resolve the remaining debts within two years.  Security concerns based on financial\nconsiderations are mitigated.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 20, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance.  On July 12, 2007, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\n\nThe cover letter from Applicant\u2019s counsel is dated November 9, 2007, but the date imprinted on the facsimile\n1\ncover sheet (AX G) is November 8, 2007, and it was actually received on November 8.\n2\nthe basis for its preliminary decision to deny her application. This action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and\nmodified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented\neffective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 9, 2007, admitted some of the allegations\nand denied others, offered explanations, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on\nOctober 2, 2007, and heard as scheduled on October 30, 2007.  I kept the record open until\nNovember 9, 2007, to enable her to submit additional documentary evidence.  I received her\nadditional evidence on November 8, 2007, and it has been admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX)\nG through M.   Department Counsel\u2019s response to the additional evidence is attached to the record\n1\nas Hearing Exhibit I.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 13, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULING\nDepartment Counsel objected to two of the additional documents submitted after the hearing.\nHe objected to AX H, a letter from Applicant\u2019s counsel, on the ground that it exceeded the purpose\nfor which the record was kept open and because it is argument rather than evidence.  He objected\nto AX M, a letter from Applicant, on the ground that it is further testimony not subject to cross-\nexamination.  \nI conclude that AX H does not exceed the scope of the reason for keeping the record open.\nThe record was held open to enable Applicant to submit documentation of her contract with a law\nfirm, a credit monitoring service, and \u201cother documents in that time frame.\u201d  (Tr. 113-14.)  Both\nparties agreed that anything submitted by Applicant would be provided to Department Counsel for\ncomment or objection (Tr. 114).  AX H is argument, but post-hearing briefs are not prohibited by\nthe Directive.  Department Counsel had an opportunity to comment on the arguments in AX H, but\nhe did not.  Accordingly, I have admitted AX H.\nAX M is correctly characterized by Department Counsel as testimonial and not subjected to\ncross-examination.  \u201cBy design, the DOHA process encourages Judges to err on the side of initially\nadmitting evidence into the record and then to consider a party\u2019s objections when deciding what, if\nany, weight to give that evidence.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-12499 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2007).  AX\nM repeats much of Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, but it also adds information about her\nchildhood, and provides documentation of her medical expenses, and provides more specific\ninformation about debts incurred for a vacation trip and moving expenses.  Recognizing that AX M\nhas lesser weight because it was not tested by cross-examination, I have admitted it.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 38-year-old senior geospatial consultant for a defense contractor.  She has\nworked for her current employer since January 2006.  She received a security clearance in May 2001,\nwhile employed by the Department of Justice (Tr. 45).  She worked for the Department of Justice\nfrom May 2001 until June 2002, when she went to work for a private company involved in providing\ngeospatial services (AX K).  \nApplicant\u2019s current team leader, who has held a clearance for 17 years and known Applicant\nfor about a year and a half, testified that Applicant is \u201can excellent worker, very meticulous, very\nconscientious, innovative in her thinking, [and] a good problem solver.\u201d  (Tr. 23.)  She considers\nApplicant very prudent in financial matters (Tr. 24).  Applicant\u2019s current project manager, who has\nheld a clearance since 1997 and known her since April 2007, described her work performance as\n\u201cabsolutely\u201d excellent (Tr. 38).  A business colleague who has held a clearance since February 2003\nand known Applicant for about 18 months described her as dedicated, thorough, and hard-working\n(Tr. 31).\nApplicant was an avid athlete as a child, and she continued to participate in strenuous sports\ninto adulthood, when she began to experience severe back pain.  She was initially diagnosed as\nsuffering from arthritis and possible disc injury.  \nBefore starting her job with the Department of Justice in May 2001, she took a six-week\ninternational vacation costing about $8,000, which she paid for with a credit card.  She made an\ninterstate move to accept the Department of Justice job, costing her $6,000 in out-of-pocket moving\nexpenses and about $3,600 for a security deposit on an apartment, both paid with a credit card.  \nBetween September 2002 and December 2004, she incurred about more than $9,000 in\nuninsured medical expenses to treat her back problems.  Between October and December 2003, she\nincurred $3,200 in uninsured expenses for sinus surgery and more than $15,000 for five cancer-\nrelated surgeries (AX M).  All these expenses have been resolved except the $490 medical bill\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a (Tr. 54).  Applicant disputes this bill, claiming that she paid her surgeon in full\nbut the surgeon failed to pay the anesthesiologist (Tr. 58-59).\nIn February 2004, Applicant was laid off from her job.  Because she had been paying off her\nmedical bills, she had no financial reserves.  She had four personal credit card accounts and one\nbusiness account.  Two of the four personal accounts had zero balances, but the other two had\nbalances of $21,380 and $2,973.  The account with the larger balance included her vacation and\nmoving expenses in the spring of 2001 that were not yet paid off (Tr. 98).  She was carrying balances\non her credit cards, but all accounts were current until she was laid off.  (Government Exhibit (GX)\n2 at 12.)  \nWhen Applicant was laid off, she lost her health insurance.  In December 2004, she\naggravated her preexisting back condition while fleeing and hiding when two men broke into her\nhome, and she became partially paralyzed and unable to work (AX A; Tr. 62-69).  Her annual\n\n4\nincome in 2003 was $81,841, but it dropped to $13,471 in 2004 and $459 in 2005 (AX C at 2; Tr.\n72-73). \nApplicant started falling behind on her debts in early 2005.  She was offered a position as a\nregional sales representative for an engineering firm, but the offer was withdrawn because she was\nphysically unable to do the job.  She remained unemployed until January 2006, when she was hired\nby her current employer (Tr. 72). \nDuring her unemployment, Applicant minimized her housing expense by frequently living\nwith friends.  She borrowed a total of about $7,700 from friends, all of whom have been repaid in\nfull (GX 2 at 7, 9-11; AX B).  She applied for, received, and used food stamps.  She used her four\npersonal credit cards for living expenses when all other funds were exhausted, accumulating\ndelinquent credit card debt of about $62,000 (GX 2 at 7).\nAfter returning to work in January 2006, Applicant consulted with doctors about possible\nspinal surgery.  She learned that, even with health insurance, she would have considerable out-of-\npocket expenses.  Her lawyer advised her to take care of her medical needs before addressing her\ndelinquent debts.  She resolved her medical bills and paid back the personal loans from friends, but\nshe deferred addressing the other debts (GX 2 at 7-8).\nIn May 2007, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement in response to DOHA\ninterrogatories (GX 2 at 5).  She reported a net monthly income of $4,690 and expenses of $5,420,\nleaving a shortfall of $730.  Included in her monthly expenses was an estimated medical expense of\n$1,500 to $3,200 per month, her anticipated cost of back surgery.  Her assets included her nine-year-\nold car, which is paid off.  She reported debts totaling $44,770.  In her answer to the SOR, she\nreduced her estimated medical expense to $100, explaining she had obtained better health insurance\nthat would cover her anticipated back surgery.  Her revised personal financial statement reflects a\nnet monthly remainder of $1,720.  Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission included an updated personal\nfinancial statement reflecting a net monthly income of $5,006 and net monthly remainder of $2,524\n(AX L).  This monthly remainder is higher than the $2,000 remainder she testified to at the hearing\n(Tr. 88).\nApplicant consulted with two attorneys about her debts, but declined to hire them because\nthey wanted a $5,000 retainer.  She then contacted a credit counseling firm.  She adopted some of\nthe credit counseling firm\u2019s budgeting techniques, but she decided she could resolve her debt\nproblems herself without paying a fee to an attorney or credit counselor (Tr. 66-67).  Her plan was\nto save her net monthly remainder and pay off each debt in a lump sum.  She paid the debt in SOR\n\u00b6 1.h in August 2007, and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b in September 2007, reducing her delinquent credit\ncard debt to about $47,000.  Using this same methodology, she plans to pay off the debt in SOR \u00b6\n1.d in December 2007, the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c in February 2008, the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f in April 2008,\nand the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, the largest debt, in October 2009 (AX B; Tr. 57).  She recently hired a\nlaw firm to dispute several debts and assist her in negotiating with some of her creditors (Tr. 90-91).\nApplicant no longer uses personal credit cards.  She has one credit card for business expenses\nand a debit card for personal expenses (Tr. 86).  She has no mortgage and no car payments (AX L).\nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the table below.\n\n5\nSOR\nDebt\nAmount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nMedical bill\n$490\nDisputed\nAX B; Tr. 58-59\n1.b\nCredit card\n$12,676\nPaid Sep.07\nAX E\n1.c\nCredit card\n$4,400\nUnpaid; to be paid in\nfull Feb.08\nAX B\n1.d\nCredit card\n$6,387\nUnpaid; to be paid in\nfull Dec. 07\nAX B\n1.e\nCredit card\n$4,679\nSame debt as 1.d\nTr. 76, 95-96\n1.f\nCredit card\n$6,845\nUnpaid; to be paid in\nfull Apr. 08\nAX B; Tr. 77\n1.g\nCredit card\n$29,424\nUnpaid; to be paid in\nfull Oct. 09\nAX B; Tr. 77\n1.h\nCredit card\n$2,643\nPaid Aug 07\nGX 5 at 3; AX D; Tr. 77\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\n\n6\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe concern under Guideline F is as follows: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  AG \u00b618.\nThe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is raised where there is\n\u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of\nwillingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised\nwhen there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is\n\u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness,\nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c).  AG \u00b6 19(e) also is raised because during\nthe period after the home invasion and Applicant\u2019s physical inability to work, she consistently spent\nmore than she earned for basic living expenses.  However, AG \u00b6 19(b) is not raised because there\nis no evidence of frivolous or irresponsible spending, and there is evidence of her willingness to pay\nthe debts. \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c) and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a\nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(a).  This is a compound mitigating condition, with three disjunctive\nprongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be established by showing the conduct was \u201cso long ago,\u201d\nor \u201cso infrequent,\u201d or \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d  If any of the\nthree disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the\nconduct \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d  The first two disjunctive prongs are not established, because Applicant\u2019s has multiple\n\n7\ndebts that are not yet fully resolved.  However, the third disjunctive prong is established, because\nher financial situation was a result of a confluence of unexpected unemployment and a debilitating\ninjury during a burglary.  These events are unlikely to recur.  Her financial past does not cast doubt\non her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, because she has aggressively and\nresponsibly acted to resolve her financial problems.  She is now gainfully employed at a significantly\nhigher salary, highly respected by her colleagues, and recovered sufficiently from her injury to\ncontinue her career.  I conclude this mitigating condition is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(b).  Both\nprongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.\nAfter being laid off and injured, Applicant minimized her living expenses, often living with friends,\naggressively sought new employment, and borrowed money from friends.  When she found new\nemployment, she immediately set out to restore financial solvency.  She drives a nine-year-old car\nand lives frugally.  I conclude this condition is established.  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(c).  Applicant contacted a consumer counseling\nagency, learned some useful budgeting techniques, and realized she could start resolving some of\nher debts without paying an agency fee.  She has identified several debts appropriate for compromise\nor installment payments, and hired a lawyer to help her.  She has made significant progress in\nresolving her debts, and the situation is under control.  Although she still owes about $47,000, her\nnet monthly remainder of about $2,000 is sufficient to execute her plan to resolve all debts by\nOctober 2009.  See ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006) (Applicant not required,\nas a matter of law, to establish that every debt has been paid in its original full amount.).  The\n$47,000 is a significant amount, but it is the total amount of her debt, and it is manageable\nconsidering her income and expenses.  She has no mortgage, no car payments, and no active credit\ncard accounts.  I conclude this condition is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(d).   The\nconcept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness,\nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL\n1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  Applicant has resolved several debts, adopted a plan for\nresolving the remaining debts, and adopted a budget that will allow her to execute her plan.  She has\na track record of resolving her debts.  Between September 2002 and December 2003, before she lost\nher job, she resolved more than $27,000 in uninsured medical expenses.  Since returning to work in\nJanuary 2006, she has repaid personal loans totaling about $7,700 and paid off the debts alleged in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.h, totaling more than $15,000.  I conclude this condition is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(e).  Applicant\u2019s explanation for the disputed medical bill\n\n8\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is plausible and credible.  She provided documentary evidence that she retained\na law firm to resolve the dispute.  I conclude this condition is established.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline F, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated, talented professional.  In spite of the confluence of\ndisasters that befell her, she thoughtfully and steadfastly addressed her problems.  She is an\nextremely resilient and determined person.  She lives frugally and has adopted a realistic plan to pay\noff her remaining delinquent debts at a rate of about $2,000 per month.  Her testimony and demeanor\nat the hearing were plausible, sincere, and credible.  Her professional reputation bolsters her\ncredibility.  She has backed up her promises with actions.  She resolved her medical expenses, paid\nback the friends who helped her, and paid off the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.h.  Her current income\nand expenses leave a sufficient remainder to make her plan credible.  Except for the period of\nunemployment and serious injury, she has a track record of financial responsibility.  She has engaged\nprofessional assistance in disputing one debt and resolving the others.  Based on all the evidence,\nI am satisfied that she has the means and willingness to carry out her plan to resolve her remaining\ndebts.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns based on financial considerations.  Accordingly, I conclude she has carried her burden of\nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is granted.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the Chapter 13 bankruptcy alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. She admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e, with explanations. Her admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: Applicant is a 49-year-old administrative financial management analyst for a federal contractor (Tr. 47). She has worked for her current employer since November 1998. She served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years and retired as a chief petty officer (E-7) shortly before beginning her current job. She held a clearance in the Navy and received her current clearance as a civilian in February 1999. Applicant has been married since November 1981. Her husband retired from the Navy in January 1998 and is employed by a federal contractor (Tr. 53). He also holds a security clearance. They have a 22-year-old son; a 24-year-old daughter who is learning-disabled; and a 28-year-old stepson, with whom they have had no contact for about 10 years. Applicant currently has temporary custody of her two-year-old grandson, the child of her learning-disabled daughter (Tr. 42; AX V). Starting in 1991, Applicant and her husband purchased vacation time shares at various locations in the U.S. to reduce vacation expenses. They purchased one in 1991, one in 1993, and one in 1995. They did not consider selling them when they found themselves financially overextended, because timeshares ",

On August 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to \ndeny her application, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 24, 2007 and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  DOHA received the request on September 27, 2007. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 8, 2007, and the case was \nassigned to me on November 13, 2007.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November \n20, 2007; and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 18, 2007. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 13 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nFebruary 21, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant testified on her own behalf and presented the testimony of two witnesses. I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until January 4, 2008, to enable her \nto submit additional evidence.  On January 3, 2008, I granted her request to extend the \ntime for submitting additional evidence until January 18, 2008.  Applicant timely \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through W, some of which were admitted over \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s objections.1  My ruling on the objections is discussed below.  \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s objections are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 4, 2008. The record closed \non January 18, 2008.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.b alleged Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in \nDecember 2002 and it was granted in July 2003.  Department Counsel moved to amend \nthe SOR \u00b6 1.b to allege, \u201cOn July 31, 2003, the bankruptcy petition you filed in \nDecember 2002 for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy \nCode was dismissed.\u201d  Applicant did not object to the amendment, and I granted the \nmotion to amend (Tr. 20). \n \nObjections to Applicant\u2019s Post-hearing Submission \n \n \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence at the hearing.  I held the record \nopen to permit her to produce bank statements, correspondence from creditors, and \n\u201c[a]nything that would kind of fill in the blanks with paper to show what you\u2019ve done to \ndispose of the debts.\u201d (Tr. 139-40).  She timely submitted AX A through W.  Department \nCounsel objected to AX A, B, C, K, and L on the ground that they exceeded the scope \nof documents allowed to be submitted post-hearing.  To the extent that some of the \ndocuments address the family expenses that contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems, they exceed the category of evidence showing disposition of the debts.  \nHowever, they address matters about which Applicant testified and was cross-\nexamined.  I have the discretion to expand the scope of a post-hearing submission, and \nI have chosen to exercise that discretion in the interest of basing my decision on as \nmuch relevant information as possible.   \n \n \nDepartment Counsel also objected on the ground that AX A, B, and C, \nstatements from Applicant, her military supervisor, and her husband, are testimonial and \nnot subject to cross-examination.  Hearsay evidence is admissible, even though not \ntested by cross-examination.  ISCR Case No. 03-06770 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2004).  \nMuch of the statement from her military supervisor is advocacy rather than recitation of \nfacts, and I have treated it as such.  The statements of Applicant and her husband cover \nthe same material as was covered at the hearing, although with greater specificity in \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s exhibits were numbered as enclosures to her \u201crebuttal\u201d letter, admitted as AX B.  The enclosures were \nlettered alphabetically, and a cross-reference between the numbered enclosures and letter exhibits was annotated in \npencil on AX B and HX I. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nsome cases.  The Appeal Board has noted, \u201cBy design, the DOHA process encourages \njudges to err on the side of initially admitting evidence into the record and then to \nconsider a party\u2019s objections when deciding what, if any, weight to give that evidence.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 04-12449 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2007).  With this guidance in mind, I \nhave admitted AX A, B, and C, taking into account that they were not tested by cross-\nexamination and weighing the extent to which they are corroborated by other record \nevidence. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the Chapter 13 bankruptcy alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  She admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e, \nwith explanations. Her admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old administrative financial management analyst for a \nfederal contractor (Tr. 47).  She has worked for her current employer since November \n1998.  She served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years and retired as a chief petty officer (E-7) \nshortly before beginning her current job.  She held a clearance in the Navy and received \nher current clearance as a civilian in February 1999.   \n \nApplicant has been married since November 1981.  Her husband retired from the \nNavy in January 1998 and is employed by a federal contractor (Tr. 53).  He also holds a \nsecurity clearance. They have a 22-year-old son; a 24-year-old daughter who is \nlearning-disabled; and a 28-year-old stepson, with whom they have had no contact for \nabout 10 years.  Applicant currently has temporary custody of her two-year-old \ngrandson, the child of her learning-disabled daughter (Tr. 42; AX V).   \n \nStarting in 1991, Applicant and her husband purchased vacation time shares at \nvarious locations in the U.S. to reduce vacation expenses.  They purchased one in \n1991, one in 1993, and one in 1995. They did not consider selling them when they \nfound themselves financially overextended, because timeshares are difficult to sell (Tr. \n71). \n \nStarting in 1995 or 1996, Applicant and her husband cared for Applicant\u2019s \nmother-in-law until she recently passed away.  They paid her medical expenses and \nassumed some of her debts (Tr. 38, 54; AX B at 2). ).  Shortly before they both retired \nfrom the Navy, they bought a house in preparation for retirement.  Their financial \nsituation before retirement was tight, and they sometimes missed payments and needed \nto negotiate with creditors (Tr. 59). \n \nAfter retirement, they had credit card debt they had accumulated while on active \nduty (Tr. 40).  From 1999 to 2002, they paid for tutors and counseling for their learning-\ndisabled daughter (AX B at 3; Tr. 38).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband began working for a government contractor but was laid off \nwhen the contract expired (Tr. 39, 50).  He was unemployed for about three months, \nand they began falling behind on their debt payments and receiving calls from creditors \n(Tr. 50).  He found another job with a contractor but was laid off again when that \ncontract expired after three or four months (Tr. 51).  He was out of work for a total of \nabout eight months.  During his period of unemployment, they lived on Applicant\u2019s \nsalary and their military retired pay.  At the time, she was making an entry-level salary, \naround $40,000 annually (Tr. 57). \n \nAs they fell further behind on their debt payments, Applicant and her husband \nsought financial aid and legal advice through the Navy.  They considered debt \nconsolidation services but decided against them because the debt consolidation \nagencies charged a fee (AX B). They consulted with a civilian lawyer, who \nrecommended a Chapter 13 bankruptcy (AX B). They filed a petition for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy on December 2, 2002, and submitted a Chapter 13 payment plan.  In May \n2003, the payment plan was amended to require Applicant and her husband to \nsurrender a 1998 Chaparral speedboat and one of their timeshare condominiums to \nsatisfy secured debts.  The property was surrendered and sold (AX E at 2). \n \nIn June 2003, while approval of the Chapter 13 payment plan was pending, \nApplicant and her husband vacationed for a week in the Dominican Republic.  They \nused their timeshare program to cover the cost of lodging and spent a \u201ccouple hundred\u201d \napiece for airline tickets (Tr. 102). \n \nThe Chapter 13 payment plan finally was confirmed on July 14, 2003.  It provided \nfor payment of $560 per month for five months, and $1,423 per month thereafter (GX 6).   \n \nTwo weeks later, Applicant and her husband requested dismissal of the petition, \nbecause the required payment of $1,423 per month was more than they had been \npaying to their creditors before they filed for bankruptcy protection (AX B at 2; AX F; GX \n8).  The petition was dismissed in July 31, 2003 (Government Exhibit (GX) 3).   \n \nAfter their bankruptcy petition was dismissed, Applicant and her husband \ncontacted many of the creditors listed in the bankruptcy petition, including those alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e.   \n \nThe debt of $25,407, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, was a debt consolidation loan taken \nout around 2000 (Tr. 87).  Applicant and her husband negotiated a payment plan, \npaying $400 per month and sometimes $500 per month.  They paid the debt in full in \nOctober 2007 with a lump sum payment of $11,763 after they sold Applicant\u2019s mother-\nin-law\u2019s house (Tr. 89-90; AX I).   \n \nThe balance on the debt of $23,650, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, is reflected by the \ncreditor as $0 (AX R).  The creditor for the $872 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e informed \nApplicant that the account was \u201carchived\u201d and there are no monies due (AX Q). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThey also negotiated a payment plan for their home mortgage, brought the \npayments up to date, and eventually refinanced it (AX A; AX H; Tr. 41).  A department \nstore charge account (Claim #1 on Bankruptcy Claims Register, GX 5), is now current \nwith a $0 balance (AX O).  A credit card debt (Claim #5) was settled (AX M).  A bank \nloan (Claim # 8 or #9) was paid off (AX P).  Several debts were disputed as attributable \nto identity theft (Claims #11-14) (AX B at 4; AX C at 3), and they no longer appear on \nApplicant\u2019s credit report.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s son began college in 2003.  His tuition and fees are about $11,800 \nper year (AX K; Tr. 38). \n \nFour years ago, Applicant and her husband purchased a parcel of undeveloped \nland for $140,000 as an investment property.  They used the equity in their home to \npurchase the property and paid the purchase price in full (Tr. 95-96).  In 2006, they \npurchased another timeshare property (Tr. 71). All their timeshare properties are paid \noff, except one camping timeshare, on which they are making payments of $79 per \nmonth.  It will be paid off in March 2009 (AX B at 5; AX S).   \n \nTwo years ago they purchased a truck for about $38,000 and a camper trailer for \nabout $43,000, in preparation for their retirement.  The payments are current on these \ntwo purchases.  They plan to retire in about five years and live in the trailer (Tr. 94, 99).   \n \nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories in April 2007.  She reported that she and her husband had a net monthly \nincome of $10,678 and expenses of $7,503, leaving a net monthly remainder of about \n$3,175.  The expenses included the $500 payments on the debt consolidation loan that \nis now paid off (GX 2 at 7).  After the hearing, she submitted an updated and more \ndetailed personal financial statement reflecting net monthly income of $10,151 and \nexpenses of $9,128, leaving a net monthly remainder of about $1,023 (AX A at 2).  The \nfamily expenses increased when they obtained custody of their grandson (Tr. 93). \n \nApplicant drives a van she purchased in 1998.  Her husband drives a compact \ncar purchased around 2000 (Tr. 97).  They have about $2,000 in savings (GX 2 at 7; Tr. \n97).  Applicant has a 401(k) retirement account with her current employer.  She was \nunsure how much was in the account, but estimated it at more than $50,000 (Tr. 98).  \nShe does not know how much her husband\u2019s retirement account is worth.  They no \nlonger use credit cards; except for one gasoline card, which is current (Tr. 40, 44, 100).  \nWhen they retire, they intend to live on their military retirements, their 401(k) accounts, \nand the proceeds from the sale of their home (Tr. 100).  \n \nApplicant testified all their debt payments are current, and her assertion is \ncorroborated by the most recent credit report submitted by Department Counsel, which \nreflected only two negative entries: the charged off debt consolidation loan alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c and a credit card account (GX 11 at 3-4).  The debt consolidation loan was \npaid off (AX I), and the credit card account reflects no balance due. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony during the hearing was uncertain regarding resolution of \nsome of the debts, because her husband handled the bankruptcy and handles all the \nfamily finances (Tr. 86). Her post-hearing submission provided more specificity \nregarding her financial situation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s current civilian supervisor has known her for about 15 years.  He \ninterviewed her for her current job when he learned she was retiring from the Navy.  He \ntestified she works without supervision and has performed very well.  Even though she \nhas encountered stressful situations in her family life, it has never interfered with her \nduty performance (Tr. 121-24). \n \nApplicant\u2019s current military supervisor, a Navy commander, testified he had \nworked with Applicant on a daily basis for about a year as of the date of the hearing. \nShe has been candid about her financial and family problems.  He described her duty \nperformance as \u201cabsolutely incredible.\u201d  She is the \u201cgo to\u201d person in the organization.  \nShe is innovative, enthusiastic, and absolutely trustworthy.  He testified it would take \n\u201cabout ten people\u201d to replace her (Tr. 129-35). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . \n. . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether \nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person \naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. \nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.   \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in December 2002 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), and her petition was dismissed in July 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  It also alleges \nthree delinquent debts totaling about $49,929 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e).  The security \nconcern relating to Guideline F is set out in AG & 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@  AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmeeting financial obligations.@  AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@   \n \n \nAG 19(a) is not raised because Applicant is not unable or unwilling to satisfy her \ndebts.  For a few years after she and her husband retired from the Navy, they were \nfinancially overextended, but all delinquent debts have been resolved and payments are \ncurrent on all existing debts. \n \n \nAG 19(b) is raised by Applicant\u2019s decision to take a vacation in the Dominican \nRepublic while approval of their Chapter 13 payment plan was pending.  While the \namount spent was relatively small, using available funds for a vacation instead of \nsatisfying delinquent debts was \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d within the meaning of this \nguideline.  AG 19(c) and (e) are raised by Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts, some \nof which were resolved only recently. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@  AG \u00b6 20(a).  This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@  If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.@ \n \n \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established because some of \nthe debts were not resolved until recently.  The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not \nestablished because Applicant had multiple delinquent debts that remained unresolved \nfor several years.   \n \n \nThe third prong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) is established.  Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has \npassed away, the expenses incurred for her care are resolved and will not recur, and \nthe debts Applicant assumed from her mother-in-law have been resolved.  Applicant \nand her husband have paid off all but one of their timeshare properties, brought their \nprimary home mortgage payments up to date, and refinanced their home mortgage.  \nThey have no credit card debt.  Their careers have progressed to the point where they \nhave a net annual income of more than $120,000.   \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nThe fourth prong (\u201ccurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) is \nestablished.  Applicant and her husband have righted their financial ship and live a \nmodest lifestyle. Applicant\u2019s supervisors regard her as honest and absolutely \ntrustworthy.  I conclude the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 20(a) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \n \nApplicant encountered several conditions beyond her control: her husband\u2019s loss \nof employment for about eight months, the expenses incurred for the education of her \nlearning-disabled daughter, the expenses incurred to care for her mother-in-law, and the \ndebts incurred by her mother-in-law.  She has not always acted reasonably in response \nto the financial demands that were beyond her control.  Taking a vacation while the \nbankruptcy petition was pending was not reasonable or responsible, but the financial \nimpact of this vacation was minimal.  Disposing of an expensive boat and a vacation \ntimeshare during the bankruptcy was reasonable, but it occurred at the direction of the \nbankruptcy judge and apparently was not voluntarily initiated by Applicant.  However, \nafter the bankruptcy was dismissed, Applicant and her husband finally recognized the \ngravity of their situation. They took aggressive steps to resolve their financial problems, \nand they have been successful.  Based on their responsible conduct after the \nbankruptcy petition was dismissed, I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition also has two prongs that may be either disjunctive or conjunctive.  It \nthe person has received counseling, it must also be shown that there are clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control.  However, if the person has \nnot received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or under control.  Applicant and her \nhusband sought financial counseling from Navy agencies before filing their bankruptcy \npetition.  Applicant recently received financial counseling and budgeting advice from a \nNavy financial specialist to further reduce existing debts and increase her savings.  Her \nfinancial situation is under control.  I conclude AG 20(c) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@  AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \n\n \n10 \n \n \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance.  Starting with the dismissal of their \nbankruptcy petition in July 2003, Applicant and her husband began aggressively \naddressing their delinquent debts.  All the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR as well \nas others not alleged have been resolved.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature woman who has worked for the Navy and held a clearance \nfor most of her adult life.  She was highly regarded while on active duty and she has \nearned a reputation for candor and trustworthiness as a contractor.  She and her \nhusband overextended themselves in their final years of military service, and for several \nyears did not appear to appreciate the seriousness of their financial situation.  However, \nafter dismissing their bankruptcy petition, they commenced serious efforts to resolve \ntheir financial problems, and they have been successful.  They are now financially \nsecure and looking forward to retirement in a few years. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

HOGAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nGina L. Marine, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nLisa Rogers, Personal Representative\nSYNOPSIS\nA security concern was raised under financial considerations because of a charged off credit\naccount in the approximate amount of $41,601.  Unbeknownst to Applicant, his wife incurred the\ncharges and did not pay the balance. He initially attempted to teach his wife a lesson by holding her\nresponsible for paying the balance off.  Once he understood that this might jeopardize his security\nclearance he settled with the credit card company and paid off the debt. He is financially responsible\nand has the means to pay the debt. Applicant mitigated the security concern raised under financial\nconsiderations. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\n Tr. at 118-121; Gov 1.\n2\n Gov 1. \n3\n Gov 1.\n4\n Tr. at 72. \n5\n2\nOn June 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued  Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations,\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nIn a sworn statement, dated July 13, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nelected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September\n11, 2007. On September 25, 2007, a notice of hearing was sent scheduling the hearing for October\n24, 2007. The hearing was held as scheduled. The government offered three exhibits which were\nadmitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1-3 without objection. Applicant offered five exhibits which\nwere marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - E and admitted. AE E was admitted over the\nGovernment's objections. The government had no objections to AE A - D.  The record was held open\nuntil November 7, 2007, in order to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant\ntimely submitted a 46 page document that was admitted as AE F without objection.  The transcript\nwas received on November 6, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn his SOR response, Applicant denies the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. In addition, after a\nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 62-year-old man employed with a Department of Defense contractor who is\napplying for a renewal of his security clearance. He has worked for the same company since 1980.\nHe has held a security clearance for 27 years with no security incidents.  He has two adult children\nfrom a prior marriage.  He married his current wife in 1986. She has five grown children.2\nOn March 13, 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) during a routine periodic update of his security clearance.   He did not list any\n34\ndelinquent accounts on his questionnaire because he had no delinquent accounts. At some point,\ncompany employees were notified of a potential security breach of their personal identification and\nwere encouraged to get a recent copy of their credit reports. Applicant obtained a copy of his credit\nreport approximately two weeks prior to being interviewed by the investigator conducting his\nbackground investigation.  The $41,601 charged off credit card account that is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a\n5\n\n Tr. at 69-70; Gov 3 at 1. \n6\n Tr. at 79. \n7\n Tr. at 70, 73; gov 2 at 19-27.\n8\n Tr. at 73. \n9\n Tr. at 73-74; AE D. \n10\n AE D at 42; AE F at 44.\n11\n AE A. \n12\n AE F at 45. \n13\n Tr. at 92-93.\n14\n Tr. at 111-113; Gov 2 at 4,5, 16, 48-61. \n15\n AE C. \n16\n AE B. \n17\n3\nwas listed on the credit report.   Applicant was surprised to see this entry because he timely pays his\n6\nbills.  The credit card is in his wife's name. He contacted the credit card company to ask why the\nentry showed up on his credit report. He was told that he is listed as an authorized user. He admits\nto making charges on the card on at least 12 occasions but always immediately paid off the charges\nmade.   He and his spouse had an agreement that he would pay his charges and she would pay hers.\n7\nHe assumed that she was making payments on her charges. Unbeknownst to Applicant, his spouse\nran up this credit card account.  When he confronted his wife about the account, he discovered that\nshe was being sued by the credit card company.8\nApplicant initially did not attempt to resolve the account because he wanted to teach his wife\na lesson.  He wanted to hold her responsible for paying the account because she incurred the charges\nand did not pay the account.   In April 2007, after he discovered that failing to resolve the account\n9\nwould adversely affect his security clearance, he started negotiating with the credit card company.10\nOn May 4, 2007, he wired a money transfer in the amount of $34,507.75 to the credit card company\nto settle the account.  On June 4, 2007, the civil suit against his wife was dismissed with prejudice.\n11\n12\nThe account is settled and paid in full.13\nApplicant took out a home equity loan in order to resolve the account. He pays $350 per\nmonth on this loan and is able to meet the monthly payments.   Applicant is conservative in his\n14\nspending habits. He maintains a debt-free lifestyle. He invested his excess income over the years and\nhas assets worth over $1 million.   A credit report dated October 16, 2007, lists no delinquent\n15\naccounts. His credit rating is \"excellent,\" the highest category.16\nApplicant's performance evaluations over the last three years indicate that he meets or\nexceeds expectations.  Applicant's daughter testified on his behalf. She stated that her father was\n17\n\n Tr. at 17-23; 63-66.\n18\n Tr. at 41-61.\n19\n Tr. at 32-38.\n20\n Tr. at 94.\n21\n Tr. at 94-95. \n22\n Tr. at 103-104. \n23\n Tr. at 85-91; Gov 2 at 28-47.\n24\n Tr. at 124-127.\n25\n Department of the Navy v.

A co-worker testified that she has worked with Applicant\n19\nover 13 1/2 years. She states Applicant is very responsible, hard working, reliable and dependable.20\nApplicant's wife receives approximately $1,300 a month from Social Security.  They\n21\npreviously agreed to be responsible for their own bills. Applicant pays most of the household bills.22\nIn 2006, after discovering the delinquent credit card account, he began assisting his wife with\nclearing up her credit issues and is attempting to monitor her spending habits. He took over paying\nher bills for her. He used to never open bills that were mailed to his wife. He now opens all bills that\ncome in the mail.  He assisted in resolving another delinquent credit card incurred by his wife which\n23\nis close to being paid in full.  He is ashamed and embarrassed about the problems this has caused.\n24\nIt caused great strain on him personally and on his marriage.25\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n26\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006,\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\n\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 18. \n27\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(a). \n28\n Id.\n29\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n30\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n31\nRevised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n32\n5\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.27\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n28\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n29\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n30\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.31\n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n32\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n6\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I make the\nfollowing conclusions.\nApplicant has had a long history of financial stability aside from this one credit debt that was\nincurred by his wife. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) initially applies in that he refused to resolve the debt initially because\nthe debt was his wife's and he wanted to her hold responsible for the bill.  He had sufficient assets to\npay the account but was unwilling to do so. \nThe concern under Financial Considerations can be mitigated. Applicant's history of financial\nresponsibility and his significant assets contradict the government's assertions of a security concern\nunder financial considerations. Through no fault of his own, the credit card balance was incurred by\nhis wife and was charged off due to her neglect. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC\nMC) \u00b6 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Applicant has a long history of financial\nstability. The credit card account was in his wife's name and she was responsible for paying the\naccount.  Unbeknownst to him, his wife made excessive charges on the bill and did not pay resulting\nin the account being charged off. The credit company eventually filed civil suit against her.  Applicant\nresolved this account once he discovered that the debt was an issue with his security clearance.\nConsidering Applicant's history of financial stability, it is unlikely that a similar circumstance will\noccur in the future. Applicant has had a security clearance for 27 years without incident. This one\nanomaly which occurred through no fault of his own does not cast doubt on his reliability,\ntrustworthiness and good judgment. \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\napplies in that Applicant was unaware that his wife was making excessive charges on her credit card\naccount and allowed the account to get delinquent. Once he discovered the account, he acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.  He settled the debt and has taken steps to actively monitor his\nwife's spending habits.\nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) applies.  Applicant resolved the account in May 2007, one month prior to\nthe issuance of his SOR. While he initially wanted to hold his wife accountable for the debt that she\nincurred, he immediately took steps to resolve the account once he discovered the security\nsignificance. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties.\nIndeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\n\n7\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness. I considered Applicant's 27 year employment history with a Department of Defense\ncontractor, his 27 year history of possessing a security clearance without incident, his favorable\nperformance reports, and the favorable recommendations of his friends and co-workers.  Applicant\nis financially stable. This one debt was incurred by his wife. His extensive history of financial stability\nand his favorable financial portfolio indicate that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was an anomaly in\nan otherwise stable financial situation. He now assists his wife with her finances to insure she does\nnot overspend in the future. The security concerns raised under financial considerations are mitigated.\nBased on the evidence in the record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

After a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 47-year-old electrical engineer working for a defense contractor. He was born in Iran. His family\u2019s ethnic background is Christian-Armenian and he considers himself Armenian. In 1977, at age 16, he entered the United States under a student visa and has never been back to Iran (Tr. 22). He came to the United States seeking educational opportunities. His father paid for Applicant\u2019s travel and educational expenses (Tr. 185). Applicant finished his last two years of high school in the United States. From 1979 to 1984, he attended a U.S. university where he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering (Tr. 94). He was granted asylum in 1984, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1994 (Tr. 21-22). He was issued a U.S. passport shortly thereafter. After college, Applicant worked 12 years as an electrical engineer for a construction company. He then worked two years as a project engineer for a U.S. state government. Between 1999 and January 2005, Applicant worked as a senior electrical engineer for a U.S. corporation, upgrading electrical systems on numerous U.S. overseas facilities (Tr. 24-25, 98).

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing on \nNovember 8, 2005. On July 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJune 16, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR (Answer) on October 4, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on December \n19, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 24, 2007. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on January 23, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 3, which were admitted without objection.2 Applicant testified on his own behalf, \nand presented 11 exhibits, marked AE 1 through 11, which were received without \nobjection.3 DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 29, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.b, \u00b6 2.a (in part), and \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.b - d, and \u00b6\u00b6 2.f-i with explanations. He denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a (in part), and \u00b6 2.e. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all \nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old electrical engineer working for a defense contractor. \nHe was born in Iran. His family\u2019s ethnic background is Christian-Armenian and he \nconsiders himself Armenian. In 1977, at age 16, he entered the United States under a \nstudent visa and has never been back to Iran (Tr. 22). He came to the United States \nseeking educational opportunities. His father paid for Applicant\u2019s travel and educational \nexpenses (Tr. 185). Applicant finished his last two years of high school in the United \nStates. From 1979 to 1984, he attended a U.S. university where he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering (Tr. 94). He was granted asylum in 1984, \nand became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1994 (Tr. 21-22). He was issued a U.S. \npassport shortly thereafter.  \n \nAfter college, Applicant worked 12 years as an electrical engineer for a \nconstruction company. He then worked two years as a project engineer for a U.S. state \ngovernment. Between 1999 and January 2005, Applicant worked as a senior electrical \nengineer for a U.S. corporation, upgrading electrical systems on numerous U.S. \noverseas facilities (Tr. 24-25, 98). To have access to the facilities and perform his job, \nhe was issued a secret security clearance in 1999, which was upgraded to a top secret \nsecurity clearance in 2003 (Tr. 26). During this period, he traveled to 28 different foreign \ncountries, including Middle East countries using an official U.S. government passport. \nHe applied for the renewal of his top secret security clearance in March and November \n2005. \n \nWhile working overseas (from 1999 to 2003), Applicant owned a house in the \nUnited States and considered the United States his domicile. In 2003, Applicant was \n \n2  GE 3 was marked for identification and considered for administrative notice only. \n \n3  AE 11 was timely submitted post-hearing. I kept the record open to allow Applicant time to \nsubmit additional documentation. Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum, stating no objections to me \nconsidering Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission is included in AE 11. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                     \ntraveling frequently and spending so much time outside of the United States that he \ndecided he had no need for his own home. To save money, he sold his home and \nstarted using his sister\u2019s address in the United States as his home address (Tr. 27). \n \nIn January 2005, Applicant\u2019s employer lost his contracts with the government. \nApplicant then entered into a one-year consulting contract with his former employer to \nperform the warranty work required of his former employer for all the overseas jobs they \nperformed (Tr. 29). In February 2006, Applicant started working for his current \nemployer, the government contractor who won the overseas contracts. He became a \npermanent employee in December 2006 (Tr. 40). Applicant\u2019s employer encouraged him \nto live in Armenia because it was time efficient and cost effective for the contractor. His \nresidence in Armenia allowed Applicant to use Armenia as a staging place from where \nto travel to the many different job sites throughout Europe (Tr. 41).4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s father passed away in Iran in 1993. He did not attend his father\u2019s \nfuneral. He believes he cannot go back to Iran because he left Iran before the Iranian \nRevolution; he is a Christian-Armenian, and he requested asylum in the United States. \nApplicant stated his intent never to return to Iran (Tr. 23). Applicant has no immediate \nfamily members in Iran. To his knowledge, none of his extended family members living \nin Iran work for the Iranian government, and they are practicing Christians.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and two sisters were born in Iran. In 1996, his mother \nimmigrated to the United States and became a naturalized U.S. citizen (Tr. 127-130). \nHis mother has a brother and a sister living in Iran. Applicant believes his mother has \ncontact with her siblings approximately twice a year, usually during the Christmas \nholidays (Tr. 138). However, he claimed not to know for sure since he does not live with \nhis mother. Sister \u201cA\u201d immigrated to the United States in 1986 as a refugee. She \nfinished college in the United States, became a dentist, and married a U.S. citizen (Tr. \n32-34). Sister \u201cB\u201d immigrated to the United States in 1999 and is in the process of \napplying for U.S. citizenship. She lives with Applicant\u2019s mother and is employed by the \nsame university the sister attends (Tr. 34-36). Applicant testified he has little or no \ncontact with the Iranian community in the United States. He has no property or any \nfinancial interests in Iran.  \n \nApplicant traveled to Armenia for the first time in 1994. His mother and sister \ntravelled to Armenia from Iran to meet with him there. This was the first contact \nApplicant had with his mother since 1977 when he left Iran (Tr. 189). In 2000 and 2004, \nhe travelled to Armenia with a friend (a naturalized U.S. citizen from Armenia) and \nstayed in Armenia for approximately 30 days during each visit (Tr. 28, 105, 108).  \n \nDuring his 2004 visit, Applicant requested an \u201cArmenian Special Residency \nStatus Document,\u201d which he received in January 2005. The document entitled Applicant \nto some of privileges reserved for Armenian citizens such as the ability to purchase land \n(Tr. 124), to open two bank accounts (Tr. 126), and to travel to Armenia without a visa \n \n4  AE 1 (Letter from current employer, dated 1/16/2008). \n\n \n4 \n \n \n(Tr. 117). According to Applicant, the \u201cSpecial Residency Status Document\u201d was issued \nto him because he is of Armenian decent. He was not required to apply for Armenian \ncitizenship, or to be an Armenian permanent resident for him to receive the Special \nResidency Status (Tr. 120). Applicant credibly testified he never applied for Armenian \ncitizenship, and that he never was considered an Armenian permanent resident. \nApplicant convincingly testified he is a proud American citizen, and that he would never \nrelinquish his U.S. citizenship (Tr. 121). Applicant\u2019s \u201cSpecial Residency Status \nDocument\u201d identified Applicant as a U.S. national (Tr. 36, AE 3). \n \nApplicant explained that the \u201cSpecial Residency Status Document\u201d was not an \nArmenian passport or an Armenian travel document because it could not be used to \nenter Armenia or any other country. It only allowed him to substitute it for an Armenian \nvisa provided it was used in conjunction with his U.S. passport (Tr. 55). On numerous \noccasions during his hearing, Applicant expressed his willingness to surrender the \nArmenian document (Tr. 54, 182). On January 29, 2008, at Applicant\u2019s request, his \ncompany\u2019s facility security officer destroyed Applicant\u2019s \u201cArmenian Special Residency \nStatus Document\u201d (AE 12). \n \nApplicant lived in Armenia from January to August 2005, most of the year in \n2006, and from January to May of 2007. Applicant explained he liked the country and its \npeople and wanted to explore his ancestral home. In 2005, when he started his \nconsulting contract to perform the warranty work required for numerous overseas jobs, \nApplicant decided to expend time in Armenia and to use the country as his home base. \nStaying in Armenia in between jobs was less expensive and more time efficient than \nliving and traveling from the United States.  \nIn October 2005, Applicant met his now wife. An Armenian friend living in the \nUnited States introduced him to an Armenian resident with the purpose of helping \nApplicant find an Armenian wife (Tr. 99, 101). Applicant felt an Armenian wife would \nhave less trouble adapting to his work and travel schedule. His wife worked as a bank \nteller in Armenia. In November 2005, he took his mother to Armenia to meet his fianc\u00e9 \nand formalize his engagement (Tr. 39). Applicant disclosed to the government \ncontractor, and to the government, his foreign contacts as well as his intent to marry a \nforeign person (Tr. 46-47, AE 2). Applicant testified he was told it was okay to marry an \nArmenian citizen because they were from a country friendly to the United States (Tr. \n49).  \n \nApplicant married his wife in Armenia in May 2006. She was granted a U.S. visa \nin June 2006 and they traveled to the United States in October 2006. Applicant\u2019s wife is \ncurrently living in the United States. She has U.S. permanent resident alien status (Tr. \n56, AE 4). Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s mother and two siblings are citizens and residents of \nArmenia (Tr. 140). Her mother and sister always have been homemakers (Tr. 58). His \nsister-in-law\u2019s husband served two years in the Armenian army (Tr. 144). Since then, he \nhas worked in a power plant (Tr. 146). Her brother is an auto mechanic. Applicant and \nhis wife have telephone contact with her immediate family members and other relatives \napproximately twice a month (Tr. 148). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant bought five real estate properties in Armenia for investment \npurposes, these include:  \n \n(a) A condo he purchased in January 2005 for $40,000, with a current estimated \nvalue of $54,000. Applicant lived in the condo while visiting Armenia. As of August \n2007, when Applicant and his wife left Armenia, the condo has been empty. Applicant \nhas been actively attempting to sell the condo with the assistance of his brother-in-law \n(Tr. 159-162). \n \n(b) In May 2005, he bought a $175,000 plot of land with two other partners \n(Armenian born U.S. naturalized citizens). Applicant\u2019s had a one-third share interest in \nthe investment. Applicant sold the property in 2007 after receipt of the SOR (Tr. 163-\n168). \n \n(c) In September 2005, Applicant bought a $20,000 property. He sold it for \n$37,000 after receipt of the SOR (Tr. 169-171). \n \n(d) In December 2005, Applicant purchased a $27,000 plot of land. As of the day \nof the hearing, the property was on the market for sale. \n \n(e) Applicant also purchased a $34,000 property with a cousin. His cousin is a \ncitizen of Iran who has been living in the United States as a permanent resident alien \nsince 1999. As of the day of the hearing, the property was on the market for sale (Tr. \n174-175). \n \nApplicant learned about the Government\u2019s security concerns regarding his \nforeign investments and living overseas after receipt of the SOR in July 2007. He \nimmediately placed all the properties for sale, and sold two of them between July and \nOctober 2007. He also gave his wife a power of attorney to sell the properties on his \nbehalf so that he could surrender the Armenian Special Residency Status Document \n(Tr. 59-61). Applicant testified his brother-in-law is assisting with the sale of the other \nthree properties.  \n \nAround 2005-2006, Applicant opened two bank accounts in Armenia to facilitate \nhis real estate transactions and living in Armenia. As of August 2007, both bank \naccounts were closed (Tr. 69, AE 6). \n \nApplicant has numerous extended family members (uncles and cousins) who are \ncitizens and residents of Iran. He has had no contact with his extended family members \nin Iran since he left Iran in 1977, except for an uncle and a cousin who attended \nApplicant\u2019s November 2005 engagement party in Armenia. Applicant testified both his \nuncle and cousin are practicing Christians. His cousin works as a secretary and his \nuncle a typewriter technician. Since 2005, Applicant has had telephonic contact with his \nuncle once a year during Christmas and New Year (Tr. 74-77). His last contact with his \ncousin was in the spring of 2006. Applicant called his cousin to congratulate her on her \n\n \n6 \n \n \nengagement (Tr. 137). To his knowledge, his mother\u2019s contacts with her family in Iran \nare infrequent. He has no reason to believe anyone in Armenia could exercise any \ninfluence over him of his wife to force him to act in a way contrary to U.S. interests. \n \nApplicant owns a $532,500 home in the United States which he purchased in \nAugust 2007. His equity in the home is over $200,000 (AE 11). Applicant also owns a \nvehicle with a value of around $14,000. Additionally, Applicant has liquid assets that \ninclude approximately $490,000 invested in U.S. bank accounts, IRAs, a retirement plan \n(401(k)), and money market accounts (AE 11). \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence included two statements; one from the vice president of the \ncompany he works for, and the other from a senior supervisor, both of whom have \nknown Applicant for approximately two years. Additionally, he submitted statements \nfrom two friends who have known him for over 23 years. In their opinion, Applicant is a \nloyal American citizen who poses no risk to the interests of the United States. All of his \nreferences provided solid recommendations concerning Applicant\u2019s moral character and \noverall behavior. All of them recommended Applicant for a security clearance. \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Armenia is a constitutional \nrepublic with a developing economy. Historically, Armenia was the first nation to adopt \nChristianity as a state religion. More than 90% of its population is nominally affiliated \nwith the Armenian Apostolic Church. Ethnically 95% of the population is Armenian. In \nthe 1920, Armenia was invaded by the Red Army and became a Soviet Republic until \nthe collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1991, it declared its independence from the Soviet \nUnion. \n \nSince then, the United States has made a concerted effort to help Armenia in its \ntransition to a democratic form of government and a free-market economy. These \nefforts include providing over $1.5 billion in humanitarian and technical assistance, \nparticipating in several trade agreements, and closely working with international \nfinancial institutions to help develop Armenia\u2019s economy. \n \nArmenia\u2019s human rights record is poor. Its government, military and police forces \ndo not respect the human rights and freedoms provided for in its constitution. \nAdditionally, there are concerns about Armenia\u2019s elections being tainted with \nwidespread corruption. \n \nIran is a \u201ctheocratic Islamic republic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the \nkey power structures.\u201d Iran engages in clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons \nand other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in defiance of the International \ncommunity, sponsors international terrorism, intervenes in the internal affairs of Iraq, is \narming terrorists in Iraq, undermines the Middle East peace process, and violates the \nhuman rights of the Iranian people. The United States and its allies are attempting to \nblock Iran\u2019s goals of obtaining nuclear weapons and other WMD and to counter Iran\u2019s \nefforts to destabilize Iraq and other the Middle East countries.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                     \nIran is one of the most active state sponsors of terrorism. The United States is \nconcerned about the possibility that terrorists could eventually obtain WMD from Iran. \nIran supports terrorists who attack Israel and Shiite militias who pursue sectarian \nviolence in Iraq. Iranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens, should carefully consider the \nrisks of travel in Iran because they are still considered Iranian citizens by Iranian \nauthorities. Iran does not recognize dual citizenship. The Iranian government has \nharassed and detained dual citizens of the United States and Iran. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d6 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \n5  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n6  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder Guideline C the government\u2019s concern is that \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in \nsuch a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then \nhe or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. \n \nApplicant traveled to Armenia in 1994, 2000, and 2004. In 2003, he sold his \nhome in the United States while working for a government contractor overseas because \nhe was not using it. He was frequently traveling throughout Europe and the Middle East \nas part of his job. In 2004, based on his Armenian ethnic background, Applicant \nrequested \u201cArmenian Special Residency Status\u201d to conduct business in Armenia. He \nwas issued an Armenian Special Residency Status document that granted him special \nprivileges and rights, i.e., to purchase land, open bank accounts, and enter the country \nwithout a visa.  \n \nBetween 2005 and 2006, Applicant used his Special Residency Status to open \ntwo bank accounts, and to buy five real estate properties, albeit for investment \npurposes. Applicant established his residence, and lived in Armenia for most of the year \nduring 2005, 2006, and almost half of the year in 2007. The Armenian Special \nResidency Status document, in conjunction with his U.S. passport, allowed Applicant to \ntravel in and out of Armenia without need for an Armenian visa.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions raise security concerns under Guideline C. Foreign \npreference disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 10(a), \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign \ncitizenship of a family member. This includes . . . (3): accepting educational, medical, \nretirement, social welfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country, and AG \u00b6 10 (b) \naction to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen.\u201d \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualification conditions \nin AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(3) and 10(b), and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nand prove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never \nshifts to the Government.7 \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified he never intended to show allegiance to Armenia, to \nrenounce his U.S. citizenship, or to become an Armenian national. Applicant merely \nwanted to minimize his travel time and improve his efficiency while working overseas for \na government contractor by using Armenia as a convenient stop in between jobs. \nConcerning the properties, he explained he bought them as an investment. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 11 provides for six foreign influence mitigating conditions that are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority. \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \n \nNone of these six mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11 are directly applicable to \nthe facts of this case. Notwithstanding, I find that Applicant\u2019s actions after being made \naware of the security concerns mitigate the Foreign Preference security concerns. On \nJanuary 29, 2008, at Applicant\u2019s request, his company\u2019s facility security officer shredded \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cArmenian Special Residency Status document.\u201d Applicant credibly testified \nhe was not aware his investments in Armenia or his living in Armenia could raise \nsecurity concerns. After made aware of the security concerns, Applicant immediately \nmoved back to the United States with his new wife, closed his two Armenian bank \naccounts, and began to dispose of his real estate investments in Armenia. He sold two \nof the properties and is diligently attempting to sell the remaining three properties.  \n \n7See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                     \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and , \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned, or foreign-operated business, which could \nsubject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.8  \n \n8  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nApplicant has frequent contacts and a close relationship of affection and/or \nobligation with his wife, and as a consequence with his wife\u2019s mother and siblings. The \ncloseness of the relationship between his wife and her family is shown to some extent \nby his wife\u2019s contacts with her mother and siblings. These contacts create a risk of \nforeign pressure or attempted exploitation because there is always the possibility that \nArmenian agents or terrorists may exploit the opportunity to obtain information about the \nUnited States. His connection to her family members also creates a potential conflict of \ninterest because his relationship is sufficiently close to raise a security concern about \nhis desire to help his wife or his wife\u2019s family by providing sensitive or classified \ninformation. Applicant also has numerous extended family members (uncles and \ncousins) who are residents and citizens of Iran \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these four potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nFour Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and, \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s favorable information is sufficient to mitigate the Foreign \nInfluence security concerns.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s close relationship with his wife and his wife family creates a risk of \nforeign pressure or attempted exploitation. However, in light of Armenia\u2019s history and \ncurrent diplomatic and economic relationship with the United States, I do not believe \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his wife and her family members in Armenia create a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAvailable information suggests Armenia\u2019s government does not have a history of \ntargeting American citizens to obtain U.S. information. Armenia and the United States \nhave diplomatic and economic relations, and the United States is currently assisting \nArmenia with billions of dollars in economic and technical aid. Also, there is no evidence \nArmenia\u2019s government has ever collected or is collecting U.S. military, economic, or \ntechnical information. Under the circumstances of this case, it is unlikely that Applicant \nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual or government and the U.S. interests. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient relationship and \nloyalty to the United States, that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States\u2019 interests. He has lived in the United States for approximately \n31 years, during which he finished high school and attended college. He has been a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen for 14 years. Applicant\u2019s mother and two siblings live in the \nUnited States. All of his financial and business interests were in the United States until \n2005 when he decided to make some investments in Armenia and to live in Armenia for \nhis personal convenience and that of his employer, a U.S. contractor providing services \nto the U.S. government overseas. Applicant has established himself as a proud \nAmerican citizen and a successful engineer. He has worked hard for two U.S. \ncontractors overseas for approximately nine years, and has established a track record \nof diligent labor. Immediately after being made aware of the government\u2019s security \nconcerns, Applicant diligently started the process of divesting himself of the foreign \nbank accounts and investments. More importantly, Applicant immediately returned to \nthe United States with his wife to make the United States their home. \n \nApplicant\u2019s extended family members (uncles and cousins), who are residents \nand citizens of Iran, raise a more serious security concern. The nature of Iran\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that Applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States. The hostility of Iran to the United States places a \n\u201cvery heavy burden of persuasion\u201d on Applicant to demonstrate that his extended family \nmembers in Iran do not pose a security risk and that it is unlikely he will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the interests \n\n \n13 \n \n \nd (b) apply. \n                                                     \nof his Iranian family members.9 With its adversarial stance and its negative human \nrights record, it is likely that Iran would target any citizen in an attempt to gather \nclassified or sensitive information from the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) an\n \nApplicant has had limited or no contact or communication with most of his Iranian \nrelatives since he left Iran in 1977. He has maintained some contact with the uncle and \na niece who attended his 2005 engagement party in Armenia. Since then, Applicant has \nhad telephone contact with his uncle once or twice a year during the holidays. Overall, I \nfind Applicant\u2019s contact with his extended family members is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk of foreign influence or exploitation. I \nalso considered that none of his relatives work for the Iranian government or military or \nany news media. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) and (c) apply. \n \nConcerning Applicant\u2019s financial investments in Armenia, as of the hearing date, \nhe owned three real estate properties with a combine value of approximately $115,000. \nHe has no other foreign investments. Comparing the value of his foreign investments \nwith his U.S. investments, Applicant owns significantly larger investments in the United \nStates. These include a $532,500 home with an accumulated equity of over $200,000, \nand approximately $500,000 in liquid assets in a 401(k) retirement plan, IRA, mutual \nfund investments, and bank accounts. I favorably considered that after Applicant \nlearned about the Government\u2019s security concerns regarding his foreign investments \nand his living in a foreign country, he immediately placed all of his real estate \ninvestments for sale, and closed his two foreign bank accounts.  \n \nAlthough the security concern remains because Applicant still owns investment \nproperties in Armenia, his diligent actions to divest himself of the investments, and \nmoving back to the United States weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. I also considered in \nApplicant\u2019s favor that his employer, a government contractor, encouraged him to live \nabroad in order to improve efficiency in the delivery of services to the government and \nto reduce financial expenses. Considering the record as a whole, I find the value and \nnature of Applicant\u2019s foreign investments, when viewed in light of his actions and value \nof investments in the United States, are such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict \nof interest and could not be effectively used to influence, manipulate or pressure \nApplicant. AG \u00b6 8(f) applies. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n9 See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating an applicant has \u201ca very \nheavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when parents and siblings live in Iran).  \nSee also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nstandard when an applicant has family members living in Iran).   \n\n \n14 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant credibly averred his loyalty to the United States, his desire to help the \nUnited States, and his desire never to surrender his U.S. citizenship. Applicant has lived \nin the United States for close to 28 years and has been a naturalized citizen for 14 \nyears. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance to the United States. He \nfinished high school and obtained his college degree in the United States. Since then, \nhe has been a productive member of the American society and worked diligently for \ngovernment contractors for close to nine years. Applicant has not travelled to Iran since \n1977 and has casual and infrequent contact with extended family members in Iran. His \nmother and one of his sisters are residents and citizens of the United States. His other \nsister and Applicant\u2019s wife live in the United States and are in the process of applying \nfor naturalization. After being made aware of the government\u2019s security concerns, \nApplicant diligently started the process of divesting himself of the foreign bank accounts \nand investments. More importantly, Applicant returned to the United States with his wife \nto make the United States their home.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference and foreign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n15 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 13, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On August 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \n \n1  Item 4.  \n \n2  Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Aug. 6, 2007). Item I is the source for the facts in \nthe remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nJuly 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.3 The SOR alleges security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).4 The SOR detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn August 31, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated November 1, 2007, was provided to \nhim, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.5 Applicant did not respond to the FORM. On June \n16, 2008, a DOHA employee contacted Appellant, and learned he received the FORM \nand did not have a response. The case was assigned to me on June 23, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($5,854), 1.b ($3,602), 1.c ($11,542), \n1.e ($1,131), 1.f ($1,031), and 1.g ($1,017). He denied the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \n($157), 1.h ($103) and 1.i ($50), stating that he had insufficient information about those \ndebts. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of \nfact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old aerospace products technician.6 He married in 1988. \nHis children were born in 1987, 1989, 1990 and 1995. He served in the Navy from 1980 \nto 1984.7 He has specialty and college education. He has never been fired from a job. \nHe has no police record. He has not used illegal drugs in the last seven years, and has \n \n3  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n4  When he completed his SF 86, he admitted that he had: (1) a lien placed against his property \nfor failing to pay his taxes, but explained it was paid in full; (2) debts delinquent over 180 days in the last \nseven years; and (3) debts currently delinquent over 90 days. See Item 4, Sections 27c, 27d, 28a and \n28b.    \n \n5  Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated Nov. 1, 2007. The \nDOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit \ninformation. \n \n6  Item 4 (2005 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n \n7  The file does not contain his Naval or enlistment records.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nnever used illegal drugs while in a sensitive position. From 1986 to the present he has \nbeen continuously employed by a defense contractor working in aerospace products.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe following table shows the status of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR: \n \nSOR \u00b6 and Type Debt  \nAmount \nStatus \n\u00b6 1.a Financial Account  \n$5,854 \nDebt charged off in Feb. 2000 \n(Items 1, 3) \n\u00b6 1.b Financial Account \n$3,602 \nDebt placed for collection in Sep.  \n2000 (Items 1, 3) \n\u00b6 1.c Auto Loan  \n$11,542 \nDebt charged off in July 2004 \n(Items 1, 3) \n\u00b6 1.d Financial Account \n$157 \nNot substantiated (Items 1, 3 at 2)  \n\u00b6 1.e Department Store \nAccount \n$1,131 \nCollection account reported in \nNov. 2005 (Items 1, Item 3 at 2)  \n\u00b6 1.f Department Store \nAccount \n$1,031 \nCollection account reported in \nNov. 2005 (Items 1, 3 at 2)  \n\u00b6 1.g Department Store \nAccount \n$1,017 \nCollection account reported in \nNov. 2005 (Items 1, 3 at 2)  \n\u00b6 1.h Financial Account \n$103 \nNot substantiated (Items 1, 3 at 2) \n\u00b6 1.i Medical Account \n$50 \nNot substantiated (Items 1, 3 at 2) \n \nOn June 11, 2007, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories asking about \nthe status of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He stated one was charged off. \nRegarding most of the other delinquent debts, he stated he did not have the funds to \npay them. A review of Applicant\u2019s credit reports shows he has had delinquent debts \nsince 2000, which remain unpaid to the day he received the FORM. Other debts \nbecame delinquent as recently as 2005. Applicant noted he served four years in the \nU.S. Navy, and he promised he would never jeopardize the security of the United \nStates. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d8 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).9 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n8  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n9  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his response \nto DOHA interrogatories and his SOR response. He admitted responsibility for six \ndelinquent debts, totaling approximately $24,000. His debts became delinquent \nbetween 2000 and 2005, and continue to be delinquent. The government established \nthe disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,10 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he has dealt \nresponsibly with his financial obligations. Applicant presented little or no evidence about \nhow he acquired the debts, why did they become delinquent, or what efforts he has \ntaken over the years to pay, contact creditors, or to otherwise resolve any of the debts \nsince he acquired them. He presented little or no evidence to show he dealt responsibly \nwith his financial obligations after receipt of the SOR (i.e., paid debts, settlements, \ndocumented negotiations, payment plans, budgets, financial assistance/counseling). He \nfailed to disclose any circumstances beyond his control (i.e., such as loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation) that caused his financial problems.11 Nor is there any evidence that he \nhas participated in any financial counseling. \n \nI conclude Applicant\u2019s six delinquent debts, totaling about $24,000 are still valid, \nand Applicant is responsible for them. His overall conduct with his creditors casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He should have been \nmore diligent and made greater efforts to resolve his delinquent debts, especially after \nreceipt of the SOR.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that \nhe has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that he has taken control \nof his financial situation. Based on the available evidence, his financial problems are \ncontinuing and likely to recur and to be a concern in the future. Moreover, his financial \nproblems are recent, not isolated, and ongoing. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n \n10  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis, all debts are considered as a whole. \n \n11  \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in his favor. There is no evidence \nof any security violation. Aside from his delinquent debts (which is a civil, non-criminal \nissue), he is a law-abiding citizen. He served in the Navy for four years. These factors \nshow some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. The overall amount of his \ndelinquent debt at about $24,000 is relatively low, and some of his debts may be barred \nfrom legal enforcement by the statute of limitations.   \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s age, education, and employment history, he was well aware of \nhis financial responsibilities. He failed to satisfactorily explain why he could not develop \na payment plan and begin payment to his creditors. He learned of the security \nsignificance of these delinquent debts in August 2007 when he responded to the SOR. \nHis efforts to resolve his delinquent debts were insufficient, and his actions were not \nadequate to fully resolve security concerns. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to financial \nconsiderations.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d12 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n Against Applicant \n \n \n12  See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nTwila Byars, Personal Representative\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports list approximately $27,000 of delinquent debt. Although she\ndisputes all except one, she failed to provide documented proof substantiating the basis of her\ndisputes, and has not taken any action to  resolve the one she acknowledges. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 4, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. She\nanswered the SOR on June 25, 2007, denying all the allegations and requesting a hearing.\n\nSOR subparagraphs 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h are duplicate of 1.a. \n1\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on August 15, 2007. On August 23, 2007, DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing scheduling it for September 12, 2007. During the hearing, I received three\ngovernment exhibits, three Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At Applicant\u2019s request\nI left the record open for her to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, she submitted\nthree additional exhibits which I incorporated into the record. DOHA received the transcript on\nSeptember 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant is a 55-year-old  woman with two adult children. Her marriage ended in divorce\nin 1989. She earned a GED in 1973, and has worked as a mail clerk for a defense contractor for 30\nyears.\nApplicant is highly respected on the job. According to her current supervisor, she is a\ntrustworthy person with high moral and ethical principles. (Exhibit E) A former supervisor describes\nher as a person of integrity. (Exhibit B)\nBetween April 2002 and October 2005, Applicant was laid off three times. The first layoff\nlasted five months, the next one, which occurred in February 2003, lasted a month, and the most\nrecent one occurred between July 2003 and October 2005. (Answer at 4) Since November 2006,\nApplicant has been on disability leave. Her salary is 20 per cent less than it was before she became\ndisabled. (Tr. 32) \nThrough 2002, Applicant was current on her debt payments. (Tr.54) When the layoffs began,\nshe began to encounter financial difficulties. (Tr. 30, 34) She used her credit cards as a stopgap\nmeasure.\nApplicant increasingly began to struggle to make ends meet. In December 2003, she sold her\nhome and moved in with her mother. (Tr. 33) She earned between 15 and 20 thousand dollars on the\nsale that she used to satisfy debts not listed in the SOR. (Tr. 65)\nApplicant does not know how many credit card accounts grew delinquent or the amount of\nthe credit card delinquencies she accrued while unemployed. (Tr. 50) At some point, she destroyed\nall of her credit cards. She could not identify the creditors who had issued her the credit cards, and\nthe record is unclear when she destroyed them. \nCurrently, Applicant\u2019s credit report reflects approximately $27,000 of delinquent debt. All\nare owed to banks, credit card companies, or collection agencies. According to Applicant, all except\nsubparagraph 1.a, which she acknowledges,  were either her ex-husband\u2019s, or were the product of\n1\nmistaken identity. (Tr. 43)\nCurrently, she owes approximately $6,200 toward the satisfaction of SOR subparagraph 1.a.\n(Exhibit 2 at 6) She has not developed a payment plan, or sought the help of a credit counselor to\n\n3\nbegin satisfying it. (Tr. 77) Also, she has not contacted any of the creditors to address the disputed\ndelinquencies.\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in 2005. She did not list any delinquent\ndebt as required in response to question 28. Upon reconsideration, she realized she should have\ndisclosed it. (Tr. 60) Before being confronted by a security clearance investigator, she informed\nsomeone in her company\u2019s security office of her omission. (Id.)\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented by DoD on\nSeptember 1, 2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions)\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2)the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the age of the\napplicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d See generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec.\n4.2. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are based on the evidence\ncontained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d(Adjudicative Guideline (AG)\nParagraph 18). Here, Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of Financial\n\n4\nConsiderations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\nFC DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, and FC DC 19(e): consistent spending\nbeyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash\nflow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies are still outstanding. Although she disputes all but one of them,\nI cannot conclude they are not her responsibility because she failed to provide either a reasonable\nbasis for her disputes, or any evidence of actions to resolve them. Neither Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and does not case doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, nor FC MC 20(e): the individual\nhas a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue, applies.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by a series of layoffs. Her ability to resolve them is\nhindered by a disability that renders her unable to work. Although she receives disability benefits,\nthey are approximately 20 percent less than her income. \nIn December 2003, Applicant generated approximately 15 to 20 thousand dollars by selling\nher home. She used this to pay debts not listed in the SOR. Since then, she has not taken any steps\nto resolve the debt she acknowledges, nor contacted the creditors of the disputed delinquencies. Also,\nshe has never sought credit counseling. Consequently, although FC MC 20(b): the condition that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances, applies, it has minimal probative value.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to either attend credit counseling, identify delinquencies, or pay them\nrenders FC MC 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control, and FC MC 20(d):\nthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\ninapplicable. Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder the this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d (AG  \u00b615) Here,\nApplicant\u2019s omission of the delinquencies listed on her credit bureau report raises the issue of\nwhether Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 16(a): deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or\ntrustworthiness determination, applies.\nShortly after Applicant completed the security clearance application, she realized she should\nhave disclosed her history of financial problems. Before being confronted by a security clearance\ninvestigator, she informed someone in her company\u2019s security office. Personal Conduct Mitigating\nCondition 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\n\n5\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts, applies. Applicant has mitigated\nthe personal conduct security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant contended that all of the SOR delinquencies except SOR subparagraph 1.a and its\nduplicates, were erroneously attributed to her. This contention is undercut by her failure to inform\nthe disputed creditors, her failure to begin satisfying SOR subparagraph 1.a, and her failure to take\nany action to organize her finances. Consequently, the fact that her financial problems were caused\nby circumstances beyond her control is insufficient to overcome the negative security implications\nof the continuing financial problems. Evaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept,\nI conclude her financial problems remain a security concern. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. A series of unfortunate events\nled to Applicant\u2019s financial problems, and ultimately to her filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy (2004). She\ndiligently paid her creditors under that plan until 2007. Due to accumulated medical debts from\nunforeseen illness and medical emergencies, she converted to a Chapter 7 in September 2007.\nApplicant has mitigated the financial considerations concern.  Clearance is granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated June 3, 2005).\n2\nId.\n3\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On August 13, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on\nSeptember 20, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on October 25, 2007. I scheduled a hearing for November 15, 2007.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on November 15, 2007 to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nGovernment exhibits (GE 1-7) were admitted. Testimony was taken from Applicant. The transcript\n(Tr.) was received on November, 26, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the truth of the factual allegations set forth in the SOR pertaining to\nfinancial considerations under Guideline F (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.m.) Those admissions are\nincorporated as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record,\nI make the following additional finding of fact:\nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She received her GED in\napproximately 1990. Shortly after leaving school, she married and traveled with her husband for\nwork. Her first child was born in 1988. At that time, Applicant was working in the home and\nfinancially dependent on her husband. They divorced in 1993.  When she divorced, she gave her\n2\nhusband the property and family home. He was responsible for paying the debts. However that did\nnot occur. She remarried a year later but divorced in 2001.  She is now a  single mother of three\nchildren. Applicant has been with her current employer for 15 years and has had a security clearance\nsince 1993.3\nIn 1999, Applicant decided to be tested because she was having difficulty with her college\nmath course. She was concerned because she felt she needed to get more education to procure a\nbetter paying job, and did not want to fail the math course. At that time, she was diagnosed with\nAttention Deficit Disorder/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADDHD) and a mathematics disability\n\nGE 6 (Response to Financial Interrogatories, dated July 13, 2007).\n4\nId.\n5\nTr. 38.\n6\nGE 5 (Credit Bureau Report).\n7\nTr.58-59.\n8\nGE (Bankruptcy Petition, filed January 28, 2004 with conversion attachment, September 21, 2007).\n9\nTr. 61.\n10\nTr.49.\n11\n3\n(Dyscalcula). Applicant also experienced some problems with fatigue, body pain and low grade\nfever. In 2001, at the time of her second divorce, she was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.  \n4\nIn 2002, Applicant purchased a home for herself and her three children. She used loan money\nto purchase furnishings and plant shrubs and trees. She was making payments on all the items that\nshe purchased. Later in 2002, Applicant injured her back at work. Due to the nature of the injury, she\nwas on work restrictions that did not allow her to get additional salary for hazardous work nor\novertime. Thus, her salary was greatly reduced. At one point, she was earning an hourly wage of\n$7.00.  At the same time, she also had medical bills to pay and missed some months from work. She\n5\nwas required to take medications that were costly. Her middle son has had several accidents\nrequiring surgery.6\nDuring Applicant\u2019s second marriage, her husband took care of all the financial matters. After\nher second divorce, she started having great financial difficulties. Her son also has an attention\ndeficit disorder and had several accidents. Thus, she incurred more medical bills.7\nShe petitioned for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in January 2004 as a last resort.  Under that plan\nshe made payments successfully and the case was to be discharged in February 2009.  Applicant\n8\nwanted to pay all her creditors. She successfully did so until very recently.  However, she began\n9\nhaving difficulty making the $700 bi-weekly amounts. She had no money left for telephone bills and\nutilities. She and her children were living on about $229 every two weeks after the $700 was\nautomatically deducted from her paycheck. The $229 was the amount of child support that she was\nreceiving from her ex-husbands. In fact, she gave up her phone for a period of time. The constant\nmedical bills and her adjustable rate mortgage increased her mortgage payments. This did not leave\nenough money to buy food for her three children.\nApplicant pulled a hamstring and was out of work in the summer of 2007 for four weeks. She\nhad exhausted her sick leave and thus, she did not receive any pay for the four pay periods. She\nrealized that she could not continue to keep up with the bankruptcy payments and live at the same\ntime.10\nApplicant believed that perhaps she should sell her house since she could not keep up with\nthe increased mortgage payments.   In September 2007, she consulted the bankruptcy attorney who\n11\nadvised her to convert her Chapter 13 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. If she did that, she\n\nTr. 43.\n12\nGE 5 (Credit Bureau Report); Tr 31.\n13\nId.\n14\nTr. 57.\n15\nTr. 61.\n16\nTr. 67.\n17\nDepartment of the Navy v.

She would also have the additional money ($700) that she was paying for the Chapter 13\npayments.12\nApplicant has $7,700 in delinquent debt.  All the debt is for unpaid medical bills except one.\n13\n(Allegations 1.b-m, with the exception of 1.f). The alleged debts in the SOR were listed as \u201cmedical\nprovider.\u201d  None of the bills has an account number.  \n14\nThe alleged debt in allegation 1.f  is $3,924. Applicant used the services of a tax preparer.\nShe explained to them that she was involved in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy payment. They advised that\nshe could receive a \u201cquick refund\u201d. She learned that this was not correct. The IRS informed her that\nthe money was owed to them. The IRS did not give Applicant the tax refund, but applied it to her\ndebt. She did not have enough money to pay the tax preparer. Thus, she took out a personal loan.15\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $1,295.00, which includes child support. After\nexpenses, she has a net monthly remainder. She is current on her mortgage and car payments. \nShe does not use credit cards and has incurred no new debts, with the exception of some small\nmedical bills. These bills (all alleged in the SOR) will be covered when she finalizes the conversion\nto the Chapter 7 bankruptcy.16\nIn addition to the advice that she has received from the bankruptcy attorney and financial\ninformation that she received going through the conversion from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7\nbankruptcy, Applicant spoke to a representative at the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) at work.\nThe counselor is in the National Guard and Applicant is waiting for her to return from deployment\nso that she can talk with her.17\nApplicant has been employed with her current employer for almost 15 years. She has received\nvarious awards. She has maintained her security clearance since 1993 with no problems.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n18\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\n\nId. at 527.\n19\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n20\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n21\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n22\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n23\n5\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n19\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n20\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n21\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n22\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n23\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. \n\nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors\n24\nor otherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term\n\u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a\nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).\nSee ISCR 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FC MC 6 for\n25\ndebts being resolved through garnishment). \n6\nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts resulting in bankruptcy in 2004 is not disputed. Thus,\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. Her admissions\nand credit reports confirm the delinquent debts, and the Chapter 13 bankruptcy and conversion to\nChapter 7 in 2007.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nAlthough FC MC 20 (a) does not provide a temporal or specific definition of what constitutes\n\u201crecent\u201d conduct, Applicant\u2019s overall conduct with creditors does not cast doubt on her current\nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. She has shown sufficient unusual circumstances to\nestablish that her financial problems are \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201dApplicant suffered a period of\nunemployment, divorce, injuries/illness for herself and her children. These were all beyond her\ncontrol and she acted in a responsible manner. I find that FC MC 20(a) is partially applicable. FC\nMC 20(b) is applicable for the reasons stated above. \nFC MC 20(c) partially applies due to the counseling she received from her attorney, the\nEmployee Assistance Program and the help she sought from her ex-husband.   She merits some\n24\ncredit for using bankruptcy, which is a legal means for resolving her debts.  Initially, in 2004, she\n25\nchose Chapter 13 so that she could repay her creditors. She made payment of $700 from 2004 until\nSeptember 2007. She did want to resolve her debts and not ignore her creditors. Bankruptcy\nsubstantially reduced her debts, and accordingly reduced her potential vulnerability to improper\n\n7\nfinancial inducements. The conversion to Chapter 7 will eliminate the debt, which consists of many\nmedical bills that Applicant could not pay despite her health insurance.     \nFC MC 20(d) is applicable because she chose to petition for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2004\nand had an automatic deduction of $700 bi-weekly so that she could pay her creditors. This was not\nan easy thing for the single mother of three to do. This was a legal and good faith effort on her part\nto show good faith in resolving debts. \nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nA series of unfortunate events led to Applicant\u2019s financial problems, and ultimately to her\nfiling bankruptcy in 2004. Applicant used a legally available option to address her debts. Applicant\nworked hard, despite some medical problems, to pay her creditors under the Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nplan. She had $700 automatically deducted from her pay bi-weekly beginning in 2004. As stated\nabove, bankruptcy eliminated Applicant\u2019s debts, and accordingly reduced her potential vulnerability\nto improper financial inducements. In 2004, Applicant suffered more loss but continued to work hard\nand support her family. She did the best she could to raise her family and pay her bills. The stress\nof these conditions resulted in illness and stress for Applicant. She has worked for her employer for\nalmost 15 years and has maintained a security clearance since 1993. Her initial payment plan under\nChapter 13 attests to her commitment to pay her debts. She has stable employment and with\ncounseling from the EAP program will be able to handle her financial affairs. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non her financial issues. She is eligible for a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security\nclearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges security\nconcerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 26, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case\nwas assigned to me on July 16, 2007, and heard on August 14, 2007, as scheduled.  I kept the record\nopen until August 24, 2007, to enable Applicant to submit documentary evidence.  I received her\nevidence on August 21, 2007, and it is admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A.  DOHA received\nthe transcript (Tr.) on August 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 24-year-old multifunctional information systems associate who has been\nemployed by a defense contractor since her graduation from college in May 2006.  She has a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering.  She does not hold a clearance.  \nApplicant was born in Iran and came to the U.S. in 1999, intending to complete her education\nand live permanently in the U.S. (Tr. 35, 40).  She became a U.S. citizen in April 2005.  She is a dual\ncitizen of the U.S. and Iran by virtue of her birth in Iran.\nApplicant\u2019s mother and stepfather were born in Iran.  Her biological father died in 2001 (Tr.\n43).  Her mother became a U.S. citizen in November 2000 (Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at 24), and\nher stepfather became a U.S. citizen in December 2006 (AX A at 3).  Her mother and stepfather own\na home in the U.S., but they reside about half the time in Iran, taking care of Applicant\u2019s\n\n3\ngrandmother.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s mother was in the U.S. and her stepfather was\nin Iran (Tr. 45-46).  Her mother intends to travel to Iran in October 2007 and remain until about May\n2008 (Tr. 54-55).\nApplicant\u2019s mother is not employed outside the home. Her stepfather is an architect\nemployed by a private company in Iran (Tr. 51).  He also owns an import business in the U.S., in\npartnership with Applicant\u2019s stepbrother (Tr. 60).\nApplicant is not close to her stepfather.  In Iran, she lived with her biological father after her\nparents were divorced, in accordance with Iranian custom (Tr. 61).  After her father died and her\nmother remarried, she lived with them for only about one year (Tr. 62).\nApplicant has a 26-year-old stepbrother who is a native-born U.S. citizen, and  a 23-year-old\nstepsister who is a citizen of Iran.  Both her stepbrother and stepsister reside in the U.S. (GX 1 at 27-\n29; Tr. 46).  Applicant is not close to her stepbrother and stepsister. \nAt the time Applicant submitted her security clearance application, she had two roommates\nwho were Iranian citizens (GX 1 at 30-31).  They were sisters who fled from Iran because of\nreligious persecution.  One was a U.S. citizen and the other a permanent U.S. resident (Tr. 48).\nApplicant needed roommates because she could not afford to pay the full amount of the rent.  She\nnow lives with her mother (Tr. 47). \nApplicant used her Iranian passport to visit Iran in 2000, 2001, and 2002.  She renewed her\nIranian passport in October 2005, after becoming a U.S. citizen, and she used it to visit Iran in\nDecember 2005.  All her visits to Iran were short, about a week or two, except the trip in 2001,\nwhich lasted about six months due to the illness and death of her father (Tr. 43).  She visited her\nelderly grandmother on each trip (Tr. 44).  She testified she is \u201cvery close\u201d to her grandmother,\nhaving grown up with her (Tr. 63).  She has telephonic contact with her grandmother about once a\nyear, but her grandmother is elderly, bedridden most of the time, has Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and\nusually doesn\u2019t remember Applicant (Tr. 52, 59). \nAt the hearing, Applicant expressed reluctance to surrender her Iranian passport because it\nwould make it difficult for her to visit her grandmother.  However, she surrendered her Iranian\npassport on August 17, 2007, after the hearing was adjourned (AX A at 2).\nRegarding her dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, Applicant testified: \u201cI know United States is my\ncountry more than Iran is my country, because I really work here in this country and I\u2019d love to live\nhere for the rest of my life.  I don\u2019t want any issue to be arising just because I\u2019m Iranian or I\u2019m\nholding Persian citizenship, because I don\u2019t have anything to do with that country.\u201d  (Tr. 65.)\nAt Department Counsel\u2019s request, and without objection from Applicant, I took\nadministrative notice of relevant adjudicative facts about Iran (Hearing Exhibit (HX) I; Tr. 26-28).\nIran is a theocratic Islamic republic dominated by Shia Muslim clergy, with ultimate political\nauthority vested in a learned religious scholar. Current U.S. concerns about Iran are based on its\nefforts to acquire nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction; support for and involvement\nin international terrorism; support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and its\nhuman rights abuses, including summary executions, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and\n\n4\nrestrictions on civil liberties.  Iran has provided guidance, training, and weapons to Shia political and\nmilitant groups in Iraq.  It also provides encouragement, training, funding, and weapons to anti-\nIsraeli terrorist groups in its efforts to undermine the Arab-Israeli peace process (HX I at 2-4).\nThe U.S. has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism.  The U.S. broke diplomatic\nrelations with Iran in April 1980, prohibits most trade with Iran, and uses multilateral sanctions and\ndiplomatic pressure to contain the threats posed by Iran (HX I at 2-3). \nIran does not recognize dual citizenship.  As a result, Iranian-born, naturalized U.S. citizens\nare considered solely Iranian citizens by the Iranian authorities, and they are subject to surveillance,\nsearch, harassment, arrest, and imprisonment while traveling or residing in Iran (HX I at 5-6).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in the Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant exercises dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship (SOR \u00b6 1.a), renewed\nher Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c), and used her Iranian\npassport instead of her U.S. passport to travel to Iran in December 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.d).  The concern\nunder this guideline is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  AG \u00b6 9.  A disqualifying\ncondition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 10(a)(1).  Applicant\u2019s possession and use of a current Iranian passport raise this disqualifying\ncondition.  \nAlthough worded somewhat differently, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege essentially the same\nconduct, i.e., renewing her Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen.  When the same conduct\nis alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be\nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same\ndebt alleged twice).  Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.b in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying condition in\nAG \u00b610(a)(1), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,\nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5\n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual citizenship\nis based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(a).  This mitigating\ncondition is established.\nSecurity concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport also may be mitigated if\n\u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(e).  This mitigating condition also is established.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Iran and the U.S. and resides in Iran\n(SOR \u00b6 2.a); that her stepfather is a permanent resident of the U.S., a citizen of Iran, and resides in\nIran (SOR \u00b6 2.b); that Applicant\u2019s roommates are citizens of Iran residing in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 2.c);\nthat Applicant traveled to Iran in 2000, 2002, and December 2005 (SOR \u00b6 2.d); and that she traveled\nto Iran from about January to May 2001 (SOR \u00b6 2.e).  \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication\n\n6\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether\nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6.\nThree disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  First, a\ndisqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  Second, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a\nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  Third, a security\nconcern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless\nof citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d).\nApplicant\u2019s mother and stepfather are both naturalized U.S. citizens, but they are also Iranian\ncitizens based on their place of birth.  I conclude they are not \u201cforeign\u201d persons within the meaning\nof AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b).  However, they both reside in Iran about half the time, giving rise to the\n\u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \u00b6 7(a) and the \u201cpotential conflict of interest\u201d in AG \u00b6 7(b).  I conclude that\nthose two disqualifying conditions are raised.\nApplicant currently resides with her mother.  Her mother\u2019s travel to and extended stays in\nIran while caring for Applicant\u2019s grandmother create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d thereby raising the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 7(d). \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with her two roommates, one of whom was a U.S. citizen, was solely\na matter of economic convenience, and it no longer exists.  Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.c in her\nfavor.\nApplicant\u2019s five-month visit to Iran from January 2001 to May 2001 was related solely to the\nillness and death of her father.  Security concerns based on the citizenship and residence of\nApplicant\u2019s father and her visits with him in Iran were resolved by his death.  Accordingly, I resolve\nSOR \u00b6 2.e in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nApplicant\u2019s grandmother is a \u201cforeign\u201d person, but her citizenship and place of residence are\nnot alleged in the SOR.  Accordingly, her grandmother\u2019s citizenship and residence may not be\nconsidered as an independent basis for denying Applicant a clearance.  However, conduct not alleged\nin the SOR may be considered  \u201c(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s\nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant\nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under\nDirective Section 6.3.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted).\nApplicant\u2019s travel to Iran in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2005 was directly related to her close relationship\nwith her grandmother in Iran.  I have considered the citizenship and residence of her grandmother\n\n7\nfor the limited purpose of assessing the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s travel to Iran to visit\nher grandmother and her parents\u2019 extended visits to Iran to care for her grandmother.\nSince the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d) are raised, the burden is on\nApplicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Security concerns\nunder this guideline may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons\nin that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as\nwell as each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep.\n22, 2003). \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nAlthough Applicant has no strong ties to her stepfather, the presence of her mother and\ngrandmother in Iran, a country hostile to the U.S. with an abysmal human rights record, may well\ncreate a conflict of interest between concerns for the health and safety of her mother and\ngrandmother and the interests of the U.S.  I conclude mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 8(a) is established\nfor her stepfather, but not for her mother and grandmother.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).  Applicant has no love for Iran and feels strong ties to the\nU.S., but her affection and sense of loyalty and obligation to her mother and grandmother are also\nvery strong.  I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is established for her stepfather, but not for her mother and\ngrandmother.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \u201ccontact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it\n\n8\ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(c).  Applicant\u2019s communication\nwith her grandmother is infrequent but not casual.  Her communication with her mother while her\nmother resides in Iran is neither casual nor infrequent.  I conclude AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  \nApplicant is a relatively young woman who has lived in the U.S. for about eight years and\nhas been a U.S. citizen for more than three years.  She is enthusiastic about her life and professional\nopportunities in the U.S., and she has no affection for Iran or its government.  All her family\nmembers except her grandmother are U.S. citizens.  She is close to her mother and grandmother, but\nnot her stepfather, stepbrother, and stepsister.  For as long as her grandmother lives, and her mother\ncontinues to spend about half her time in Iran, Applicant will be vulnerable to pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress.\nI have weighed the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines C\nand B; considered the nature of the Iranian government, its human rights record, its involvement in\ninternational terrorism, and its efforts to foster instability in neighboring countries; considered the\ntotality of Applicant\u2019s family ties as well as each family tie; and evaluated all the evidence in the\ncontext of the whole person. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based on\nforeign preference, but she has not mitigated the concern based on foreign influence.  Accordingly,\nI conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant her a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Kenneth M. Roberts, Attorney At Law\nJuly 30, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on November 7,\n2005. On December 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nG for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 3, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing through counsel on March 6, 2008, and requested a hearing before\nan Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on April 7, 2008.  The case was\nassigned to this Administrative Judge on April 10, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued\non April 17, 2008, and the matter was scheduled for hearing on May 8, 2008.  On April\n24, 2008, Applicant\u2019s Counsel requested a continuance based upon good cause.  A\n\n2\ncontinuance was granted, and the matter was rescheduled for hearing on May 29, 2008.\nThe hearing was held on that date.  The Government presented eight exhibits, referred\nto as Government Exhibits 1 through 8, which were received without objection. The\nApplicant called two witnesses and presented nineteen exhibits, referred to as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through S, which were received without objection. The Applicant\nalso testified on his own behalf.  The Government motioned to amend allegation 1(a) of\nthe SOR to reflect \u201cMarch of 2004 to May 2004.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s Counsel had no objection,\nand said amendment was made.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nJune 20, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, specifically pages 212\nthrough 214.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel objected, but was overruled.  (Tr. pp. 121-124).  The\ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 50 years old and unmarried.  He has a Master\u2019s Degree in\nElectrical Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer, and is\napplying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nThe Applicant began consuming alcohol at the young age of fifteen.  As time\npassed, his social drinking on weekends progressively worsened to daily use.  From\n2002 until August 2005, the Applicant consumed as much as a pint of bourbon a day,\nevery day, for weeks at a time.  During late 2003 through 2005, the Applicant\u2019s alcohol\nconsumption became so excessive, that through intervention by friends and family he\nwas convinced to seek treatment for his addiction.  He explained that he was lonely, his\njob had gone from being exciting to one big pile of stress, and he had lost touch with\nGod.  \nFrom March 2004 to May 2004, the Applicant received outpatient treatment for\nhis excessive alcohol consumption and for the first time was diagnosed with, among\nother things, \u201calcohol dependency\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 6).  \n\n3\nA year later, in June 2005, the Applicant was admitted to the hospital for\ndetoxification.  His blood alcohol content was .168 upon admission, and he complained\nof tremors, blackouts, hallucinations, hypertension and appetite loss.  He was again\ndiagnosed with \u201calcohol dependency\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 7).    \nTwo months later, in August 2005, the Applicant was again admitted into a\nhospital for detoxification.  His blood alcohol level was .165 upon admission.  At that\ntime, he admitted to drinking a 1/5 of vodka per day to include the day of his admission.\nHe was again diagnosed with \u201calcohol dependency\u201d.  The Applicant was also diagnosed\nwith clinical depression and chronic insomnia by his medical physician and psychologist\nand it was explained to him that he was self-medicating himself with alcohol.\n(Government Exhibit 8).          \nSince January 2004, the Applicant has attended psychotherapy sessions weekly\nto bi-weekly related to depression.  He abused alcohol in isolation at home primarily on\nthe weekends to cope with his feelings.  In August 2006, he started taking anti-\ndepressants which have proven to be very helpful.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H and\nGovernment Exhibit 5).\nIn 2006, the Applicant called in sick to work for a day or two because of the\neffects of his drinking.  For example, when the Applicant learned that his security\nclearance was in jeopardy last year, he fell into depression and binged on beer and\nJack Daniels for several days.  (Tr. p. 93).  He testified that he abstained from alcohol\nfor several months at a time, and could go as long as six or eight months between\nrelapses.  \nIn August 2007, the Applicant stated to the Government investigator that he has\na glass or two of wine or beer when he goes out with social groups or with dinner.  He\nconsumes alcohol in this manner about three to five times a week.  (Government Exhibit\n4).  Since then, the Applicant has somewhat reduced his drinking.  He states that he no\nlonger drinks and drives.  The last time he drank to the point of impairment or\nintoxication occurred about a month before the hearing.  (Tr. pp. 115 -116).  On that\noccasion, the Applicant and his brother consumed beer and the Applicant had no more\nthan six beers.  Presently, the Applicant continues to consume alcohol in social settings,\nand does not believe that it is unhealthy for him to do so.  He avoids drinking at home,\nbut does keep alcohol in his home.  (Tr. p. 112).\nThe Applicant\u2019s personal therapist diagnosed the Applicant with depression and\nrecommended that he see his primary physician about taking anti-depressants.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H).  The Applicant contends that his excessive alcohol consumption\nwas episodic in nature, and occurred only during his period of depression and has since\nbeen corrected with counseling, medication, family support, a physical trainer and other\nmajor life changes.  He has re-established himself with meaningful relationships in his\nlife.  He is currently taking prescribed medication for his depression and insomnia.  He\nindicates that the feelings of depression have diminished to the point that they are rarely\noccur and his patterns of sleep are regular and sufficient for rest and recuperation.  He\n\n4\nreceives emotional counseling with a licensed psychologist and bi-monthly\nappointments with a massage therapist to reduce stress.  \nThe Applicant also underwent a psychiatric evaluation on May 15, 2008, for\npurposes of this hearing to determine if he is currently \u201calcohol dependent\u201d.  The\npsychiatrist, in a report dated May 27, 2008, concluded that:\nTo a reasonable degree of medical certainty, I find [the Applicant] to be\ndevoid of psychiatric or substance abuse pathologies.  What he has gone\nthrough was more of problematic transitional period than a profound\npsychopathology of addiction.  He has an excellent prognosis.  Highly\nmotivated I think it\u2019s reasonable to presume that he will complete his\ncourse of treatment with his psychologist, achieve a higher level of\nfunctioning personal functioning and be able to maintain without\nregression or concern for relapse into self-medication with substances or\nany other symptoms.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F). \nNumerous letters of recommendation from individuals that currently work with the\nApplicant or have worked with him in the past, including his manager and professional\ncolleagues, as well as long time acquaintances, attest to the Applicant\u2019s overall\nprofessionalism, intelligence, talent, dedication, attention to detail and hard working\nnature.  They consider him to be stable, reliable, honest, loyal and trustworthy.  The\nApplicant is said to have taken the necessary steps to deal with his drinking problem\nand has been successful in doing so.  He was awarded a performance based bonus in\nJanuary, and was nominated for the company\u2019s Engineer of the Year award for 2006.\nHe is highly recommended for a position of trust.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits I, J, K, L, M,\nN, O, P, Q, and R and Government Exhibit 3).  \nThe Applicant has received numerous awards and special recognition from his\nemployer for his contributions to the company.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G).\nTestimony from two individuals that know the Applicant well, one who hired the\nApplicant and was instrumental in getting him involved in the Employee Assistance\nprogram, and the other who has known the Applicant since high school and considers\nhimself to be closer than brothers with the Applicant, attest to his strong sense of\nintegrity, trustworthiness and reliability under any circumstance.  They are aware of his\ndrinking problem, have been involved in his alcohol intervention, and continue to be\nsupportive in his efforts at rehabilitation.  (Tr. p. 28 to Tr. p. 42) and Tr. p. 43 to Tr. p.\n66).    \nPolicies\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\n\n5\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22. (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\n22. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\n22. (d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n6\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nConclusion\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in alcohol abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline G of the SOR.\n\n7\nUnder Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G, Disqualifying Conditions 22(a), \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d; 22(c)\n\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless\nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d and,\n22(d) \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\u201d apply.  None of\nthe mitigating conditions are applicable. Accordingly Guideline G is found against the\nApplicant. \nThe Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse and his diagnosis of depression have\nobviously gone hand in hand for many years.  He has been consuming alcohol for at\nleast 35 years, and it is uncertain how long he has had depression.  On three separate\noccasions, the Applicant received out-patient treatment for a condition diagnosed as\n\u201calcohol dependent\u201d, including two hospitalizations where he underwent detoxification in\nJune and August 2005 for alcohol abuse.  Despite the diagnosis, the Applicant\ncontinues to consume alcohol.  He has failed to successfully complete any alcohol\nrehabilitation program.  His recent evaluation and diagnosis from his psychiatrist\nindicates that his alcohol problem may be a secondary manifestation to his primary\nproblem which is depression, however, although he has made many gains in his\nunderstanding of depression, his alcohol problem remains constant, as evidenced by\nhis recent episode of intoxication or impairment that occurred just a month before the\nhearing when he drank beer with his brother.  Based upon his long history of alcohol\nabuse, whether he is using it to self-medicate depression or not, its related negative\neffects on the Applicant are such that the Government is unable to find him sufficiently\ntrustworthy to safeguard classified information.  The Applicant is commended for his\nefforts at treating his depression, however, his underlying alcohol problem still remains\nand he has a way to go before he does not have to turn to alcohol to medicate his\nemotional or psychological issues.       \nI have also carefully considered the favorable statements from his manager,\nprofessional colleagues and long time friends, but that evidence does not come close to\nmitigating the negative effect of his excessive alcohol abuse and the effects that it can\nhave on his ability to safeguard classified information. \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.   Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.\n\n8\n     \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n____________________________\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",
