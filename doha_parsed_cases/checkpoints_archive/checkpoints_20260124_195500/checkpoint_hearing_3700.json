He \nsought and took the advice of his \u201cSite Lead,\u201d a non-certified public accountant, and \nthought he was not required to file as he lived outside the United States. (TR at page 20 \nline 19 to page 30 line 22, and at page 33 line 12 to page 40 line 16.) He has known of \nthe Government\u2019s concerns, and of his requirement to file those returns, since at least \nthe time the issuance of the SOR more than a year ago, but has submitted nothing \ndemonstrating a good-faith attempt to file those tax returns. (Id.) This allegation is found \nagainst Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n2.a. Applicant denies that he willfully falsified \u201cSection 26\u201d of his September 6, \n2018, e-QIP by failing to disclose his failure to file his federal income returns for tax \nyears 2007~2017. Applicant testified credibly that, based on the advice of his \u201cSite \nLead,\u201d he thought that he was not required to file said tax returns. (TR at page 45 line 8 \nto page 40 line 5, and at page 47 line 7 to page 49 line 23.) This allegation is found for \nApplicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns from 2006~2021. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial, filing problem is ongoing. He has yet to file his delinquent \ntax returns. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. Financial \nConsiderations is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThis condition does not apply. I find that Applicant\u2019s omission on his e-QIP was \nnot intentional, because at that time he honestly, but erroneously, believed that he was \nnot required to file the returns in question. Personal Conduct is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations concern. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 63 years old and has been married and divorced twice. His second marriage ended in 2012. He has no children.

He is a first-time applicant for a security clearance. (Tr. at 17-19; GE 1 at 7, 13-14, 22-24, 41-43.) Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleged in the SOR that Applicant is ineligible for access to classified information because he failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore potentially unreliable and untrustworthy. Specifically, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal tax returns for the last ten tax years (TYs), i.e., TYs 2012 through 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and failed to timely file his state tax return for at least TY 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In the Answer, Applicant admitted both allegations and provided additional information. The underlying facts and the status of the matters set forth in the SOR are as follows: 1.a. Failure to timely file Federal tax returns for TYs 2012 through 2021. Applicant and his second wife separated at the end of 2011. He described the separation as \u201cunexpected.\u201d They divorced in 2012.

(Tr. at 17-19; \nGE 1 at 7, 13-14, 22-24, 41-43.) \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged in the SOR that Applicant is ineligible for access to \nclassified information because he failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore \npotentially unreliable and untrustworthy. Specifically, the SOR alleged that Applicant \nfailed to timely file his Federal tax returns for the last ten tax years (TYs), i.e., TYs 2012 \nthrough 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and failed to timely file his state tax return for at least TY 2020 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). In the Answer, Applicant admitted both allegations and provided additional \ninformation. \nThe underlying facts and the status of the matters set forth in the SOR are as \nfollows: \n1.a. Failure to timely file Federal tax returns for TYs 2012 through 2021. Applicant \nand his second wife separated at the end of 2011. He described the separation as \n\u201cunexpected.\u201d They divorced in 2012. The termination of what had been a ten-year \nrelationship with six years as a married couple was difficult for Applicant and affected him \ngreatly. Applicant took time off in 2011 and took an extended vacation for most of 2011. \nHe began working as a senior engineer in November 2011. He worked with that employer \nuntil February 2014. (Tr. at 8, 32; GE 1 at 18; GE 2 at 3.) \nApplicant did not file his Federal tax returns for TYs 2012 and 2013. He claimed \nthat his failure to file was due to his emotional turmoil following his divorce. He lived in \nState A at that time, which had no state income tax. Accordingly, no state tax filing was \nrequired.

He relocated from State A to a nearby location in Canada that \nwas about 15 miles across the border of State A in February 2014 and began his new \nposition as a senior engineer. From February 2014 until February 2016, he was an \nemployee of Company 1. In February 2016, he began working as a contractor for a \nsecond Canadian firm (Company 2). His Canadian work permit expired in 2018, and he \nreturned to the United States and continued working for Company 2 remotely. He \ncompleted his work responsibilities in November 2019 and needed to look for a new job. \nHe earned the equivalent of about USD 60,000 per year while working for Companies 1 \nand 2. (Answer; Tr. at 13-14, 19-22, 26, 34; GE 1 at 16-18, 23.) \nApplicant began a job search in the United States. Shortly thereafter, the COVID-\n19 pandemic shutdown began, making it difficult to find a job. In November 2020, he was \nhired by Company 3, a DoD contractor and his clearance sponsor, and began working in \nState B. He was unemployed from November 2019 until November 2020. (Tr. at 27.) \nHis first Canadian employer, Company 1, withheld taxes for Canadian income tax \npurposes. As noted, Applicant worked for Company 2 as a contractor. Company 2, which \nwithheld no Canadian taxes, and Applicant was responsible for paying his own Canadian \ntaxes for TYs 2016 to 2019 when he worked as a contractor. Applicant paid no estimated \ntaxes to the U.S. Government while working for either Canadian company. (Tr. at 22-24, \n26, 34.) \nApplicant did not file U.S. Federal income tax returns for the tax years when he \nwas living in Canada, i.e., TY 2014 through TY 2018. He explained that though he knew \nthat he needed to file tax returns in the U.S. while he was living in Canada, he did not \nknow how to do so and did not know whom to contact for help. In addition, he filed no \nincome tax returns with the Canadian authorities during the years that he worked in \nCanada and paid no taxes to the Canadian Government other than the taxes withheld \nfrom his paychecks by Company 1. (Tr. at 22.) \nIn 2020, Applicant worked for Company 3 for a couple of months. Applicant \nretained a tax attorney in January 2021 to help him file his TY 2020 U.S. and state returns \nand his delinquent U.S. tax returns. He claimed at the hearing that he was determined to \nresolve this long-standing problem. However, his attorney advised that she would not file \nany returns until he provided her with all of the necessary tax information for all of the tax \nyears since TY 2012. Applicant claimed that he has made considerable efforts to obtain \nthe documentation required by the attorney, but he has encountered serious difficulties \ndue to the number of years involved. One significant problem he faces is that Company \n1 is no longer in business, and he is unable to obtain any income information. (Tr. at 8-9, \n14-16, 29-30.) \nIn June 2022, Applicant received from the IRS Account Transcripts for TYs 2012 \nthrough 2021.

Applicant was not specific as to whether he needed any additional \ninformation for those tax years to provide his tax attorney with the information she needed \nto file returns for those years. He testified that his returns in the past were very simple \nand could be filed using the IRS\u2019s simplified Form 1040 EZ with his income and \nwithholding information. He believed that his U.S. taxes when he was living and working \nin Canada were complicated and he could not prepare them himself as he had done in \nthe past. He could not find a tax preparer in Canada who could help him with his U.S. tax \nreturns. (Tr. at 24-28; GE 2 at 39-51, 71-77.) \nApplicant expressed frustration with his tax attorney and her unwillingness to file \nFederal tax returns for TYs 2020 and 2021 covering the income he earned in the United \nStates while working at his current job. He had all of the necessary documents. He does \nnot understand why the two most recent Federal returns have not been filed, though he \nadmitted he has never asked his lawyer that question. He believes that even though he \npaid her for her services, it may be necessary for him to find a new tax advisor to prepare \nhis recent returns. He admitted that she has not done anything for about two years. (Tr. \nat 27-30, 38-40, 44.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant was unaware about how the U.S. Government taxes \nforeign-earned income of U.S. citizens who live and work in another country. His attorney \nhas not explained to him how the U.S. foreign-earned income tax exclusion works and \nhow that exclusion would significantly reduce or eliminate his U.S. tax liability for the years \nhe lived and worked in Canada. He believes he owes about $40,000 in back taxes to the \nIRS for the four years he worked for Company 2 as a contractor (TYs 2016-2019), \nexclusive of interest and penalties. He presently has about $51,000 in savings available \nto pay his delinquent taxes. (Tr. at 31, 34-36; GE 2 at 15.) \n1.b. Failure to timely file state income tax return for at least TY 2020. Applicant \nwrote in the Answer that he intends to file his TY 2020 tax return in State B in 2022. As \nof the hearing date, he had not yet filed either his TY 2020 or his TY 2021 state returns \nfor the same reasons he has not filed his Federal tax returns for those years. (Answer at \n1; Tr. at 42.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns, as required, for TYs 2012 \nthrough 2021. He also failed to timely file his state income tax returns in State B for TYs \n2020 and 2021. The extensive record evidence of Applicant\u2019s procrastination also \nestablishes that he has been unwilling to address his delinquent tax filings. These facts \nestablish the foregoing disqualifying conditions and shift the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (b) are not established. Applicant\u2019s behavior occurred over a \nnumber of years up to the filing deadline for TY 2021, and is therefore recent and frequent. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file his Federal and state returns for the last two tax years undercuts \nthe limited record evidence in support of his financial responsibility. His conduct regarding \nhis tax filings casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s divorce was a condition beyond his control, his tax-filing \nobligations persisted. Applicant\u2019s voluntary decision to move to and work in Canada \nsimilarly did not relieve him of his tax-filing obligations. There is no evidence that he took \nany steps to address and resolve his unfiled taxes until January 2021. Applicant\u2019s failure \nto address and file his tax returns for TY 2012 and TY 2013 at some point over a \nsubsequent number of years was not responsible under the circumstances. His failure to \nfile his U.S. tax returns for the following eight tax years is further evidence that Applicant \nhas not acted responsibly. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is only partially established. Although Applicant did not seek \nprofessional tax counseling to address his unfiled U.S. tax returns until January 2021, \nwhich was after he was hired by a DoD contractor, he ultimately sought tax advice. For \nthe remainder of 2021 and through December 2022, when the record closed, Applicant \nfiled no tax returns. He claims that his attorney refused to file any tax returns until all of \nApplicant\u2019s tax records were before her and that he has done his best to obtain the \nrecords. However, he knew that Company 1 was out of business and would not be able \nto produce any tax or income records. As a result, no tax returns have been filed over the \nlast two years, not even the returns for TYs 2020 and 2021 when he resided in the United \nStates. There is no clear indication that the problem is being resolved. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and (g) are not established. Applicant\u2019s failure to hire a tax advisor \nwilling to assist him in filing even his most recent two years of tax returns evidences a \nlack of good-faith efforts to resolve his tax obligations. The same applies for the other two \nperiods of his tax-filing delinquencies, TYs 2012 and 2013 and TYs 2014 through 2019. \nAlso, Applicant has not made arrangements with the applicable tax authorities to file his \nten years of delinquent Federal tax returns and his TY 2020 state tax return. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s inaction over a period of about ten years in addressing his tax-filing obligation \nevidences an unwillingness to comply with Federal rules and regulations and raises \nserious questions about his willingness to comply with Federal rules relating to \nsafeguarding national security information. Also, the potential for pressure, exploitation, \nor duress has not been resolved. Overall, the evidence creates substantial doubt as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s family connections to \nColombia are sufficiently explained that any foreign influence security concern is \nresolved in his favor. Applicant failed to disclose his past-due student loans, and other \ndebts, on his security clearance application, but did so, in part, believing that the loans \nwere in deferred status due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Security concerns alleged \nunder Guideline E (personal conduct) are not established. Applicant had employment \ninstability which impacted his ability to address his debts for a time, but his debts are \nlarge and unresolved. He has yet to establish a track record of steady payments and \ngood-faith, responsible action towards his federal student loans. Security concerns \nunder Guideline F (financial considerations) are not mitigated.

On \nor about February 11, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DSCA CAF) issued him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations and \nGuideline E, personal conduct. The CAF issued the SOR under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, \n2017. \nIn February 2022, Applicant answered the original SOR and requested a hearing. \n(Answer # 1) The correct date of the SOR and the date of the initial Answer are \nsomewhat unclear from the record. His response was considered complete when he \nanswered all of the allegations in an e-mail to the CAF on March 2, 2022. (Tr. 11-12) \nThe case was assigned to me on April 18, 2023. The case was initially scheduled for \nJune 13, 2023, by mutual arrangement. \nAmendment to the Statement of Reasons \nOn June 7, 2023, Department Counsel amended the SOR to add a new \nallegation under Guideline B (foreign influence) as follows: \n3.a:  Your wife is a citizen and resident of Colombia.  \nApplicant did not object to the amendment, which was based on new evidence, \n(Tr. 22-23) but he requested and without objection received a continuance of the \nhearing so he could respond. (See Amended SOR and related e-mails, Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) III). On June 21, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice re-scheduling the hearing for July 17, 2023, by mutual agreement. \nApplicant answered the new allegation on July 7, 2023. (Answer # 2) \nApplicant\u2019s hearing convened on July 17, 2023, and continued, by mutual \nagreement, on July 25, 2023. Department Counsel offered materials for Administrative \nNotice (AN), marked as AN I, and Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, which were marked \nand admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-S, which were marked and admitted without objection. At the \nend of the July 25, 2023 hearing, Applicant requested additional time to submit further \ndocumentation. On August 9, 2023, he advised that he had no further exhibits to submit, \nso I closed the record. DOHA received the transcript for the July 17, 2023 hearing (Tr.) \non July 26, 2023, and received the transcript for the July 25, 2023 hearing (2Tr.) on \nAugust 3, 2023. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \nIn connection with SOR \u00b6 3.a, Department Counsel requested that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about Colombia. The supporting documentation is \nmarked as AN I. Applicant also included a U.S. State Department document for this \npurpose (AE Q) The relevant facts are addressed in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied the allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e and 2.a-2.b. He admitted \nSOR \u00b6 3.a, with a narrative explanation. His admission is incorporated into the findings \nof fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old. His first two marriages ended in divorce. He has two \ngrown children. He remarried in July 2022 to a citizen and resident of Colombia. (SOR \u00b6 \n3.a) After graduating from college in 1991, he was commissioned as a U.S. Marine \nofficer and served until 2001, as an aviator. with the rank of captain (O-3). He held a \nclearance in the Marine Corps. He earned a master\u2019s degree in global finance in May \n2009. (GE 1; Tr. 36-38; AE A; AE B, AE C) \nSubsequent employments include as a professional race car driver (2001-2003), \nan employee of his family\u2019s franchising business (2003-2006), jobs in the \npharmaceutical and health-care industries (2006-2013), and investment banking and \nfinance (2013-2015). He worked for capital investment firm A from 2015 to 2022. In \n2016 and 2017, Applicant founded two companies involved in construction and real \nestate ventures (company E) and related financing (company S), a government \ncontractor. (AE B) \nFrom June 2021 to February 2022, Applicant worked part-time at a large \nhardware store chain. From December 2021 to February 2022, he worked as a state \ngovernment employee for State 1. (AE B) Applicant has been employed full time since \nMarch 2022 as a commercial airline pilot for a major U.S. airline. He worked for a \nregional carrier until September 2022, when he was hired by a major U.S. airline. He \nseeks a security clearance for his position as the managing partner and founder of \ncompany S, a government contractor involved in a joint venture with company E. (GE 1, \nTr. 28-29, 38-45, 72-73, 94; 2Tr. 17-18 AE B) \nFor his work with capital investment firm A, Applicant worked on commission and \nnot on salary. He earned little income in his time there (2015-2022) beyond the \n$180,000 he earned in annual income in 2017. He said he had several hundred million \ndollars in construction projects lined up in his construction investment business, but \nopportunities evaporated between March and November 2020 at the start of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. By March 2021, his businesses were \u201cout of cash\u201d as was \nApplicant himself, and he soon faced \u201cfinancial ruin.\u201d He had no income from company \nS or the investment firms.

He earned $13.75 an hour for 25 hours a week. He then was hired by State \n1 through a veterans\u2019 employment program for $36,000 annually. He used those funds \nto make his flying licenses current, which was necessary for his subsequent \nemployment as a pilot. (Tr. 45-49, 72, 94-99, 127-128) \nApplicant\u2019s company S remains in a joint venture with the construction company \nthat is sponsoring his clearance application. He is considered \u201ckey management \npersonnel\u201d for company S, and he needs a clearance in that role. (2Tr. 18-21) \nGuideline F \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($50,481) and 1.b ($38,269) are federal student loan accounts that \nApplicant used to finance his master\u2019s degree. The loans were opened in 2013, \naccording to GE 5, but this may have been when they were sold to a new lender, since \nhe completed his master\u2019s degree in 2009. He said his student loans were current in \n2017 because he was earning a regular salary and making regular payments. In March \n2017, he requested that his federal student loans be placed in forbearance status due to \nlack of funds. (AE R; 2Tr. 5) \nApplicant acknowledged missing student loan payments beginning in 2019. He \nchose to prioritize basic expenses (food, utilities, gas) and business expenses. He could \nnot afford to make student loan payments. He estimated that he missed 10 student loan \npayments before seeking a deferment. (Tr. 49-53, 103-112) His finances were also \nimpacted by the pandemic. (2Tr. 43) Applicant was unable to provide a payment history \nfor his student loans because his original student loan provider went out of business. \n(2Tr. 15-17) \nApplicant said the last time he made a payment on them was in 2019. He paid \nabout $400 a month from 2009 until 2017 when he fell behind and sought to place his \ndebts in forbearance. He would make payments when he received commission checks \nand then request forbearance when \u201cmoney was starting to dry up.\u201d (2Tr. 32-34; AE R) \nHe acknowledged that the forbearance he received in 2017 was for about four or five \nmonths, and eventually his loans went to collections. (2Tr. 42-43) \nBeginning in March 2020, all federal student loans were placed in deferred or \nforbearance status by presidential executive orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tr. \n50, 84-85) An April 2023 CBR lists both federal student loan accounts as being in \u201cpays \nas agreed\u201d status. No payments are listed but no amount is past due. (GE 5) \nApplicant said he owes about $88,000 in federal student loans. He said $5,000 \nmay remain from his undergraduate degree, but $75,000 plus interest was for the \nmaster\u2019s degree. (2Tr. 32) He currently owes no amount due on an income-based \nrepayment plan for a family of four. (Tr. 81; AE D, AE E) The payment schedule options \nhe provided show monthly payments of $533 over 20 years. $1,033 over 9 years, and \n$1,533 over 6 years. (AE F; 2Tr. 30-31) His current plan to address his debts shows no \npayments for 12 months (income-based repayment), until July 2024, then $448 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npayments for months 13 to 129 (year 2 to 11).

(Tr. 80-86; 2Tr. 27-28, \n31; AE D, AE E; AE F) \nApplicant now earns an annual salary of almost $91,000 as a commercial airline \npilot. His salary is determined by length of service, job title, and the type of plane he \nflies. He expected a significant increase as of August 2023, to $108,000 annual, and \nthen an additional increase as of November 2023, to $166,000 annual. (Tr. 73-75, 78-\n80, 93-94; AE J, AE K) He has calculated future student loan payments based on the \nsignificant increased income he expects as pilot. He has a mandatory retirement age of \n65 as a pilot so he wants to pay off his student loans in 10 years. (Tr. 80-81) \nThe three other SOR debts are past-due credit card accounts. SOR \u00b6 1.c \n($1,354) is a debt that has been charged off by a bank. (GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 5) Applicant \ncontacted the creditor numerous times and was told they have no record of the account \nand referred him to a third-party collector. He does not recall or recognize this account \nbut intends to pay it off. (Tr. 69-71, 112-115, 121-122; 2Tr. 22-23) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($442 past due, total balance of $1,523) and 1.e ($204 past due, \ntotal balance of $906) are delinquent credit card accounts to the same creditor bank. \nApplicant took the cards out in about 2014 for business travel expenses (rental cars and \nhotel stays). He otherwise used credit cards only for emergencies. The accounts \nbecame delinquent in about 2019 or mid-2020 because his monthly expenses outpaced \nhis business income (what he called his \u201cburn rate\u201d). He said he contacted the creditor \nabout his payment troubles and he was allowed to make minimum payments. He also \nsaid that in 2020, the creditor offered deferred payments until December 2021, \napparently due to the pandemic. However, he was not able to provide documentation of \nthis. (Tr. 53-58; 66-69, 115-121; 2Tr. 14-15, 24; AE S) \nApplicant paid $400 towards these debts ($200 a month) in June and July 2023 \nand has about $1,800 outstanding, to be paid off by November 2023. Payments were \nautomatic until he changed banks. (Tr. 61-62; 2Tr. 25-27; AE G, AE H) These accounts \nare being resolved. \nIn 2021, Applicant\u2019s partnership rented an apartment for his use in State 1. Rent \nwas not paid on the unit for April, May, and June 2021, totaling about $4,000 to $6,000 \nin back rent. He said the rent was forgiven when he moved out at the end of June 2021. \nIt has not been paid. The creditor has not sought payment of the debt, but he plans to \nrepay it. He disclosed the debt during his background interview. (GE 2 at 2; Tr. 122-126; \n2Tr 9-12, 40-41) In retrospect, Applicant recognizes that the rent was delinquent and \nshould have been disclosed on his July 2021 SCA. (Tr. 133-134) This debt was not \nalleged in the SOR. He is current on his personal income tax filings but business tax \nfilings for his companies for tax years 2021 and 2022 remain unfiled.

He prepared a family budget and payment plan in May 2023. \n(Tr. 60-61, 63, 2Tr. 35; AE I, AE J) The budget accounts for $345 a month in student \nloan payments (total amount owed -- $92,505) and payments for the credit card debts at \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e.

(Answer # 1) \nAt his hearing, Applicant said he did not disclose the credit card accounts on his \nJuly 2021 SCA because he did not believe they were delinquent. He believed the \ncreditor had agreed to place them in deferment. He has experience in financial services \nwith accessing credit reports of others. There was nothing he did not disclose.

The country held \npresidential and legislative elections in 2022 that observers considered \nfree, fair, and peaceful.  \nIn 2016, the Government of Colombia signed a peace accord with the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), ending decades of \nconflict. \n \nArmed groups, as well as narcotics traffickers, were reported as significant \nperpetrators of human rights abuses and violent crimes, including acts of \nextrajudicial and unlawful killings, extortion, and other abuses or crimes, \nsuch as kidnapping, torture, human trafficking, bombings, restrictions on \nfreedom of movement, sexual violence, unlawful recruitment and use of \nchild soldiers, and threats of violence against journalists, women, human \nrights defenders, and religious leaders.  \n \nThe United States is committed to cooperating with Colombia to \nundermine the transnational criminal organizations whose activities, \nespecially narcotrafficking, are devastating to the citizens of Colombia and \nof the United States.  \nIn addition, the State Department advises that U.S. citizens considering \ntravel to Colombia should exercise increased caution, given the risk of civil \nunrest, violent crime, organized crime, terrorism, and kidnapping.  \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing \nthe complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmaking a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nclassified information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or classified information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and   \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding [classified] information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) require evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. It \ndenotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living \nunder a foreign government or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be \nconsidered. \nApplicant has family connections to Colombia through his wife. This raises a \n\u201cpotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or \nclassified information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, \ngroup, or country by providing that information or technology\u201d under AG \u00b6 7(b). A \nheightened risk is also established, given the administratively noticed facts about \nColombia and the State Department\u2019s travel advisory. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) therefore \napply. \nI have analyzed the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 8 and conclude the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \n \nApplicant resides with his wife (and her two teenage sons) in Colombia when he \nis on leave or off duty from his full-time job as a commercial airline pilot in the U.S. They \nhave applied for a spousal visa so she can immigrate to the United States, presumably \nwith her sons. She is close to her parents, also in Colombia, and speaks to them \nregularly, even daily. The level and frequency of Applicant\u2019s contact with his wife when \nhe is in the United States and she is in Colombia is not clear from the record, but it is \nprobably regular and frequent. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \nI conclude, however, that AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) do apply, and mitigate the \nGuideline B security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s family connections to Colombia. \nApplicant\u2019s only tie to Colombia is through his wife. It is ongoing, though they intend to \nlive there only until she can immigrate to the United States. He also has strong ties in \nthe U.S., not only as a former Marine officer and aviator but through his ongoing \nprofessional and family ties of his own. \nColombia is also undergoing transformation. This creates an atmosphere that is \nnot without risk. There is some foreign influence risk due their presence in Colombia. \nHowever, there is no indication in the record that either Applicant or his wife\u2019s family \nhave been personally adversely affected by the ongoing security risks in Colombia as \nnoted by the State Department. While some elements of heightened risk exist, \nApplicant\u2019s personal circumstances significantly lessen the chances that he might be \nsubject to exploitation, coercion, or duress through his relationship with his Colombian \nwife. AG \u00b6 8(a) therefore applies. \nWhile Applicant and his wife have understandably strong connections to her \nfamily in Colombia, this is also outweighed by Applicant\u2019s service in the Marine Corps \nand his other ties to the U.S. With that background, Applicant can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the best interests of the United States. \nApplicant met his burden of persuasion in establishing that AG \u00b6 8(b) applies to mitigate \nthe foreign influence security concerns arising in this case. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, security, and ability to protect \nclassified or classified information. Financial distress can also be caused \nor exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns under the \nfinancial considerations guideline. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant used federal student loans to finance his master\u2019s degree, which he \nearned in May 2009. His federal student loans now total about $88,000. He was making \nregular student loan payments when he was earning a steady income several years \nago, but beginning in 2017, he fell behind due to loss of income when his businesses \nstruggled. He testified that he received some deferments and resumed making \npayments when he was able to do so. An offer of deferment in 2017 is documented (AE \nR) but little else in the record is clear about what he paid and when. Applicant testified \nthat he missed about 10 student loan payments in 2019, again due to loss of income \nand prioritizing other expenses. His loans then became delinquent. (GE 3, GE 4) This is \nsufficient to apply AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Applicant\u2019s other SOR debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, \nand 1.e) are credit card debts tied to his decline in business income after 2017. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) applies to them as well.  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, security, or good judgment; \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s credit card debts are quite limited, totaling only about $3,800. He is \npaying two of them (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e) and intends to pay the other (SOR \u00b6 1.c). All \nof those debts are related to his business. They are being resolved and are not \nsignificant debts compared to his $90,000 income as a pilot. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans, however, are significant and ongoing. While \nthey have been in forbearance status due to the pandemic since March 2020, I must \nalso look to the overall payment history. Applicant incurred his student loans to pay for \nbusiness school, which he completed in 2009. He did not establish any recent \nresponsible efforts to address them. They may have been in deferred status in 2017, \nbut he fell behind again in 2019, before the pandemic, again due to loss of income from \nhis businesses. His debts are ongoing, and while he has ample income (both currently \nand expected income in the future, Applicant has yet to establish a track record of \nsteady payments towards his federal student loans that is sufficient to show good faith \nor reasonable action under the circumstances. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that his lack of action \ntowards his ongoing federal student loans is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non his current reliability, security, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply \nApplicant fell behind on his student loans and other debts when his business \nincome fell off and was outpaced by his expenses. This was a circumstance beyond his \ncontrol that impacted his finances so AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. To his credit, he has \nput himself in position to have a lucrative career as a commercial airline pilot. However, \nas noted, he has not acted responsibly by addressing his student loans in a reasonable \nmanner, despite increased income and likelihood of future increased earnings. \nEssentially, Applicant is promising to show good faith towards his student loans on the \nbasis of increased financial stability and future increased income from his job as a pilot. \nPromises to pay off delinquent debts in the future, however sincere, are not a substitute \nfor a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a \nfinancially responsible manner.

For similar reasons, \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) also do not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the financial security concern. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose his federal student loans and the other credit card debts as delinquent debts \non his July 2021 SCA. Applicant denied the allegations. \nOn the one hand, Applicant\u2019s federal student loans are established as delinquent \ndebts as they were in collection status on his August 2021 CBR. However, by that time, \nthe federal student loans were also in forbearance status due to the pandemic by \nexecutive order. Thus, they were not delinquent, and need not have been reported as \nsuch on Applicant\u2019s SCA. Further, Applicant credibly believed that they did not need to \nbe reported as such on the basis of his understanding that his federal student loans \nwere not delinquent at the time. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were delinquent at certain points before the pandemic \nbegan, in March 2020, and should probably have been reported as such on his SCA. \nBut he believed that the debts were in deferment on the basis of his prior interactions \nwith his student loan provider. He also believed that his other, credit card debts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d) were also in deferment (which is not established) and he did not \nrecognize the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.b. Ultimately, I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is not \nestablished for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a or 2.b. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ndetermination of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines B, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. \nUnder the whole-person concept, I credit Applicant\u2019s military service as a Marine \nofficer and an aviator. After carefully weighing the evidence, both favorable and \nunfavorable, and considering the whole-person factors set forth in AG \u00b6 2(d), I find that \npersonal conduct security concerns about his SCA are not established and that foreign \ninfluence security concerns are mitigated. However, Applicant did not provide enough \nevidence to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns arising from his long-\nterm and ongoing federal student loans. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for access to classified \ninformation.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \nFor Applicant \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the Applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \nApplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues were primarily related to his divorce and a downturn \nin his consulting business. He contracted with a debt-settlement company in April 2020, \nalmost two years before the SOR was issued. He is making $1,272 monthly payments \ninto the DRP. By November 2022, his deposits totaled $37,082. Three debts have been \nsettled, including one that was not alleged in the SOR. As of November 2022, the \nbalance in the escrow account was $15,802. The $67,355 debt is the next debt to be \nsettled once sufficient funds have been accumulated in the escrow account. Applicant \nhas a relatively minor tax issue that he is resolving responsibly. He credibly testified that \nhe plans to continue to pay his taxes and the DRP until his taxes and delinquent debts \nare resolved. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR.

See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant established that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and \nhe took significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances and made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His finances do not cast \ndoubt on his current judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(Item 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information \nor holding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana from about December 2011 to November 2020, and he \nused it after he had been granted a DOD security clearance in March 2018.

Although he was \nvery candid about his continued use of marijuana during the current investigation, I find \nhis explanation about not understanding marijuana use is prohibited for security-\nclearance holders to be implausible. In a 2016 SCA, he stated that he was aware \nmarijuana use was illegal, and he stated his intention to never use marijuana again. Based \non that information, he was granted a DOD security clearance in March 2018. All \ngovernment contractor employers are required to give annual training to their employees \npossessing DOD security clearances. For Applicant to claim ignorance of whether it was \nappropriate to use marijuana in November 2020 while possessing a security clearance \nsince March 2018 is not convincing. If he was confused about the laws, he should have \nrequested advice from his facility security officer (FSO). There is no information in the \nrecord that after Applicant realized using marijuana was illegal under federal law, he \nimmediately reported this information to his FSO, as required. \nApplicant stated on his 2016 SCA that he did not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture. He did not keep his word, and he used marijuana after making this significant \ndeclaration. His current statement that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future \nno longer carries certainty or conviction. None of the mitigating conditions apply. Drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana occurred after he stated his intent to abstain \nfrom using marijuana, and after he was issued a DOD security clearance. His explanation \nof confusion over state and federal law is not credible. His misconduct does not support \na finding that he is trustworthy and reliable. Given the entirety of the record evidence, I \nconclude that Applicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

I held the post-hearing record open until August \n10, 2023, to allow Applicant the opportunity to provide additional documents.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old. He has been married since 2018. He and his wife have \na five-year-old son and an 18-month-old daughter. He also has an eight-year-old son from \na prior relationship. (GE 1; Tr. 22, 29) After graduating from high school in 2005, he served \nin the National Guard from 2006 to 2020. His service included a deployment to Iraq in \n2009 to 2010. He was discharged honorably. Applicant attended community college in \n2010 to 2011 and had some technical school training in 2019. (GE 1; AE H, Tr. 40-41) \nApplicant was a DOD employee from 2014 to 2017 as a mechanic. He held various \nother jobs, mostly in the defense industry, in the years since then. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer and clearance sponsor since February 2022. He now works in \ninformation technology. He earns a $110,000 annual salary. He has a clearance (GE 1; \nAE F; Tr. 8, 27, 48-49, 53) \nSince September 2022, Applicant has also worked a second job, earning $50 an \nhour. He took the second job to pay down his credit card debt and said he has been \nmaking \u201cgreat strides\u201d in doing so. (Tr. 29-30, 36-39) He assessed that he earns about \n$8,500 a month from his two jobs combined. (Tr. 49-50) \nThe debts in the SOR are established by credit reports from September 2020 and \nMay 2021. (GE 3, GE 4) Applicant disclosed some debts on his SCA and said they \noccurred because his wife lost her job. (GE 1) \nSOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($10,262), 1.b ($10,193), 1.c ($4,744), and 1.d ($4,415) are \npast-due federal student loans owed to the Department of Education for a total of $29,614. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(GE 3, GE 4) Credit reports reflect that the accounts were last active in either February \n2017 (GE 4) or September 2020. (GE 3)  \n \nApplicant took three or four semesters of community college classes, from 2010 to \n2011, after returning from his overseas deployment. He took out about $18,000 in federal \nstudent loans. They came due in 2012 when he entered the workforce. He did not make \nany student loan payments from 2012 to 2017. In part, this was because he did not have \na solid job or good income until joining DOD in 2014. (Tr. 19-23, 42-43) His wife also lost \nher job as a logistics manager twice, once in 2018 and again in 2020; the second job loss \nwas due to the impact of COVID-19. She remains unemployed. (Tr. 28-29) \nApplicant said he signed an agreement with the student loan collector in 2018 to \nbring his accounts into good standing. He had to make nine payments of $100 a month \nto do so. He believes his loans have been in good standing since then. He was told that \na new debt collector will assume his student loans but was not told whom to pay. He said \nhe calls every month to try to learn if the loans have been reacquired. (Tr. 19-26, 30-39) \nApplicant was not required to make payments after the loans were placed in \nforbearance status by the Department of Education at the beginning of the COVID-19 \npandemic in early 2020. He used the opportunity to address other debts such as credit \ncards. He knows that the program is ending in October 2023. He made a $150 payment \nin July 2023. (AE E) During the forbearance program, he addressed other debts, such as \ncredit cards. (Tr. 19, 26, 30-39) \nApplicant documented payoff information for his student loans as of July 21, 2023. \nHe is in good standing, and a current credit report confirms this. (AE A, AE B, AE I) He \nintends to begin an aggressive repayment plan once the student loans come out of \nforbearance without exhausting his credit. (Tr. 26-27, 47-48, 58) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($274) is an account that was charged off by a bank. (GE 3, GE 4) \nApplicant testified that this debt has been resolved. SOR \u00b6 1.f ($688) is an account placed \nfor collection by a phone company. (GE 3) He paid this debt in late June 2023 (Tr. 44-46) \nHe documented two other debt payments from June 2023, an energy bill and an \nentertainment account. (AE C, AE D) \nApplicant has a 401(k) plan and savings in a bank account. Those documents \nreflect that has several thousand dollars in savings. (AE F, AE G) He pays $1,000 in child \nsupport for his oldest son. A current credit report shows a balance of about $41,000, \nthough the account is now current. (AE I). Applicant has no other delinquencies or \nextravagances. His monthly expenses are in good standing. He has no tax debt or unfiled \ntax returns. He has not had formal credit counseling, but the family uses a budget. (Tr. \n30-31, 46-47; AE I) \nApplicant acknowledged that he has made some poor financial decisions. He \nwants to continue to build good credit. He loves his job and loved serving his country in \nuniform.

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

The following AGs are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant used federal student loans to finance his education from about 2010 to \n2011. The loans were delinquent for several years because he had sporadic employment \nand did not make any payments. (GE 3) The debts were then placed in forbearance in \nearly 2020 by the Department of Education due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The other \npast-due SOR debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f) are also established. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant incurred federal student loan debts to finance his education in about \n2010 to 2011. His loans became delinquent due to his employment instability several \nyears ago, and the family\u2019s finances were also negatively impacted when his wife lost her \njob. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore has some application. Applicant rehabilitated his loans in 2018. \nThe loans were then placed into forbearance status by the Department of Education \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in early 2020. Applicant did not have to make \nstudent loan payments during the forbearance period. Instead, he used the opportunity \nto address other debts, such as credit cards. Of note, he took a second job to increase \nhis income and address his debts. A recent credit report reflects that the student loans \nare in good standing. No other significant delinquencies are reflected on a recent credit \nreport. Applicant has ample savings with which to address his student loans once \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrepayments resume. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s actions towards his debts are reasonable \nunder the circumstances and that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans became delinquent during periods of employment \ninstability for himself and his wife. They have been in forbearance status during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. They are now in good standing. Applicant earns a good living and \nhas been working two jobs in an effort to address his debts. This evidence, as well as the \nfact that has no other significant delinquencies, enhanced the credibility of his assertions \nthat he will address his student loans responsibly going forward. He is well-positioned to \naddress his student loan debts aggressively when repayment begins, and I believe he will \ndo so. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

She denied \nSOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.j. and 1.l. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since March 2019. Applicant is separated from \nher spouse, and has one child, age 13. (GX 1 at pages 7, 12 and 21~23.) She attributes \nmuch of her financial difficulties to a bad home environment that cause her to leave \nhome, and resulted in periods of unemployment. (TR at page 39 line 20 to page 40 line \n10.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n1.a., 1.d.~1.f., 1.h and 1.k. Applicant admits to outstanding student loans to \ncollege #1 totaling about $18,668. She has recently, on October 11, 2022, submitted \ndocumentation seeking \u201cloan rehabilitation.\u201d (AppX A, and TR at page 42 lines 2~7.) \nApplicant attended this college more than a decade ago.

Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of \nabout $4,350. (TR at page 16 line 11 to page 21 line 15.) As this debt appears as past-\ndue on the Government\u2019s May 2022 credit report, this allegation is found against \nApplicant. \n1.c. and 1.g. Applicant admits to outstanding student loans to college #2 totaling \nabout $5,940. (TR at page 41 line 20 to page 42 line 1.) She has submitted nothing \nfurther in this regard, these allegations are found against Applicant. \n1.j. and 1.l. Applicant denies that she has past-due debts to Creditor J in the \namount of about $970. As these alleged past-due debts do not appear on the \nGovernment\u2019s May 2022 credit report, these allegations are found for Applicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. She has a long history of \ndelinquencies. Applicant has not demonstrated that future financial problems are \nunlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. Financial Considerations is \nfound against Applicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant is respected in her community and \nin her workplace. She performs well at his job. (AppX B.) However, overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nFinancial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR soon thereafter and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on June 15, 2022. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 22, \n2022, scheduling the hearing for August 24, 2022. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 6, which were admitted \ninto evidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf and called one witness. The record \nwas left open until October 14, 2022, for receipt of additional documentation.

I will therefore apply the DOE\u2019s position most favorably to Applicant. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c.~1.i. and 1.k. She denied \nSOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.j. and 1.l. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since March 2019. Applicant is separated from \nher spouse, and has one child, age 13. (GX 1 at pages 7, 12 and 21~23.) She attributes \nmuch of her financial difficulties to a bad home environment that cause her to leave \nhome, and resulted in periods of unemployment. (TR at page 39 line 20 to page 40 line \n10.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n1.a., 1.d.~1.f., 1.h and 1.k. Applicant admits to outstanding student loans to \ncollege #1 totaling about $18,668. On October 11, 2022, she submitted documentation \nseeking \u201cloan rehabilitation.\u201d (AppX A, and TR at page 42 lines 2~7.) Applying DOE\u2019s \nNovember 2022 guidance, noted above, I find these student loans discharged, and \ndeleted as unfavorable entries on Applicant\u2019s credit report. These allegations are found \nfor Applicant. \n1.b. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of \nabout $4,350. (TR at page 16 line 11 to page 21 line 15.) As this debt appears as past-\ndue on the Government\u2019s May 2022 credit report; and Applicant has submitted nothing \nin this regard, such as a formal dispute of this entry, this allegation is found against \nApplicant. \n1.c. and 1.g. Applicant admits to outstanding student loans to college #2 totaling \nabout $5,940. (TR at page 41 line 20 to page 42 line 1.) Applying DOE\u2019s November \n2022 guidance, noted above, I find these student loans discharged, and deleted as \nunfavorable on Applicant\u2019s credit report. These allegations are found for Applicant. \n1.j. and 1.l. Applicant denies that she has past-due debts to Creditor J in the \namount of about $970. As these alleged past-due debts do not appear on the \nGovernment\u2019s May 2022 credit report, these allegations are found for Applicant. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. As noted in the findings for \nsubparagraph 1.b., Applicant still has a significant past-due debt, which she has chosen \nneither to pay nor formally dispute. Applicant has not demonstrated that future financial \nproblems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. Financial \nConsiderations is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant is respected in her community and \nin her workplace. She performs her job well. (AppX B.) If she successfully addresses \nthe $4,350, collection debt alleged in subparagraph 1.b., Applicant can certainly apply \nfor a security clearance in the future. However, overall, the record evidence, at present, \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nFinancial Considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c~1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 34 years old and single. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor as a senior software engineer since March 2019. He seeks to obtain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his current employment. Applicant has not held a security clearance in the past. (Item 3 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted all the allegations under this paragraph with explanations. As a general statement, Applicant admitted that he had an extensive history of illegal drug abuse when he worked in the restaurant industry before 2014. After he began school in 2014 his drug use continued as further described below. (Item 3 at Section 23; Item 4 at 12-14.) The allegations will be discussed in chronological order: 1.b. Applicant used and purchased marijuana on various occasions from approximately May 2006 until February 2018. (The SOR allegation that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use began in 2003 is based on a typographical error in the Report of 2 Investigation of an interview of Applicant by a Government investigator dated December 10, 2019.) Applicant\u2019s most frequent use of marijuana occurred between 2006 and 2013. During that period, he used marijuana on a daily, weekly, or bi-weekly ba",

(Item 3 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted all the allegations under this \nparagraph with explanations. \nAs a general statement, Applicant admitted that he had an extensive history of \nillegal drug abuse when he worked in the restaurant industry before 2014. After he began \nschool in 2014 his drug use continued as further described below. (Item 3 at Section 23; \nItem 4 at 12-14.) \nThe allegations will be discussed in chronological order: \n1.b. Applicant used and purchased marijuana on various occasions from \napproximately May 2006 until February 2018. (The SOR allegation that Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use began in 2003 is based on a typographical error in the Report of \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \nInvestigation of an interview of Applicant by a Government investigator dated December \n10, 2019.) Applicant\u2019s most frequent use of marijuana occurred between 2006 and 2013. \nDuring that period, he used marijuana on a daily, weekly, or bi-weekly basis. From 2014 \nto 2018 Applicant used marijuana infrequently. His last use was at a family wedding in \nFebruary 2018. (Item 3 at 46-47; Item 4 at 12; Applicant Exhibit B.) \nApplicant submitted a notarized statement of intent dated February 4, 2022, as an \nattachment to his interrogatory responses. Part of that statement says, \u201cI am not able to \ncommit to not associating with individuals who use, because many members of my family \nuse marijuana, and family is very important to me.\u201d (Item 4 at 19-20.) \n1.j. Applicant was arrested in July 2007 and charged with Operating Under the \nInfluence of Alcohol, Speeding, and Possession of a Class D Substance: Marijuana. He \nstated that he was put on probation for a year and had to obtain counseling. (Item 3 at \n42-43; Item 4 at 11.) \n1.f. Applicant purchased and used hallucinogenic mushrooms about four times \nfrom about March 2007 to about May 2010. (Item 3 at 47; Item 4 at 13.) \n1.g. Applicant purchased and used LSD about four times from about March 2007 \nto about May 2010. (Item 3 at 47; Item 4 at 13.) \n1.c. Applicant used cocaine from about April 2007 to about April 2014. He stated, \n\u201cDuring most of my restaurant career I would use cocaine once every few months, but in \n2013 when I was at . . . Steakhouse there was a couple months were [sic] I used once a \nweek on \u2018guys night.\u2019 Towards the end of this I realized that cocaine is basically a waste \nof money and I haven\u2019t used it since.\u201d (Item 3 at 47-48; Item 4 at 13; Applicant Exhibit B.) \n1.i. Applicant was arrested in about October 2009 and charged with Drug \nPossession of a Class A Substance: Heroin. Applicant stated that the charges were \ndropped. (Item 3 at 43-44; Item 4 at 11-12.) \n1.h. Applicant was arrested in December 2009 after he was involved in an \nautomobile accident. He was charged with Negligent Operation of a Motor Vehicle, \nMarked Lanes Violation, and Possession of a Class D Substance: Marijuana. He stated \nthat the Possession charge was dropped and he was put on probation for a year. (Item 3 \nat 44-45; Item 4 at 12.) \nApplicant became addicted to prescription painkillers in approximately 2009 due \nto serious pain in his legs and feet from his work in the restaurant industry. He stated, \u201cI \ntried to combat this [pain] with Aleve or Ibuprofen, but I eventually started to use stronger \nprescription medication that wasn\u2019t prescribed for me.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit B at 2.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.e. Applicant used the prescription medication Oxycontin that was not prescribed \nfor him between May 2009 to June 2012. (Item 3 at 50-51; Item 4 at 13.) \n1.d. Applicant used the prescription medication Oxymorphone that was not \nprescribed to him from about May 2011 to November 2012. Applicant used this drug \nbecause Oxycontin became more difficult to acquire. (Item 3 at 51; Item 4 at 13.) \n1.a. In about May 2012 Applicant began using the prescription drug Suboxone \ndaily as a way to combat his opioid addiction. Applicant did not obtain a prescription for \nit. Rather, he obtained the Suboxone from his father. His use of Suboxone continued for \nten years, until March 2022, just before issuance of the SOR. This was after he submitted \nhis e-QIP in 2019 and responses to DOHA interrogatories in February 2022. (Item 3 at \n51; Item 4 at 13-14.) \nApplicant enrolled in a Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program on March \n8, 2022, aimed at persons suffering from Opioid Use Disorder. A Progress Report dated \nJuly 7, 2022, states that Applicant had made eight appointments without any absences. \nThe Report describes the program: \u201cMAT is arranged as part of a comprehensive \ntreatment that includes medication with counseling and participation in [a] social support \nprogram.\u201d (Applicant Exhibits A and B at 3.) \nAlso attached to Applicant Exhibit B, at 4, is a statement dated July 7, 2022, from \na Lead Behavioral Health Technician at the counseling center Applicant attends. The \nstatement says, \u201cHe [Applicant] is currently stable and seen monthly by provider . . . . \n[Applicant] is consistent and appears committed to his recovery by reliably participating \nin MAT services. He would benefit from the continuance of medication.\u201d \nApplicant stated that he is currently on the drug Buprenorphine, with a proper \nprescription to help him combat Opioid Use Disorder. He further stated, \u201cSo far, my time \nin the MAT program has proven to be stable and successful, so I will continue this route \nuntil this is finally behind me.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit B at 2.) \nAs stated, Applicant submitted a signed statement of intent that said in part, \u201cIf \nissued security clearance, I am willing to abstain from any drug involvement or substance \nmisuse, and I acknowledge that any future involvement or misuse would be considered \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility.\u201d (Item 4 at 19.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Applicant did not admit \nor deny the sole allegation under this guideline. His silence is viewed as a denial. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.a. The Government alleges in this subparagraph that all of the information to \nwhich Applicant admitted set forth under paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under \nthis guideline. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in criminal conduct that creates doubt about a person\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant did not admit or deny the sole \nallegation under this guideline. His silence is viewed as a denial. \n \n3.a. The Government alleges in this subparagraph that all of the information to \nwhich Applicant admitted set forth under paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under \nthis guideline. \nThe record contains no evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s recent job performance, \ntrustworthiness, character in a professional setting, or track record with respect to \nhandling sensitive information and observation of job-related security procedures. I was \nunable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person, since he elected to \nhave his case decided without a hearing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana, cocaine, LSD, and hallucinogenic \nmushrooms until 2018. He was addicted to opioids from approximately 2009 through at \nleast March 2022. Applicant did not have a prescription for the opioids he used. The stated \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical practitioner. \nApplicant has a long-standing drug habit. He used and purchased marijuana, \ncocaine, LSD, and hallucinogenic mushrooms at various times between 2006 and 2018. \nHe had three drug-related arrests between 2007 and 2009. Beginning in approximately \n2009 Applicant got addicted to opioids. This addiction continued into 2022. In March 2022 \nApplicant began MAT. When the record closed in July 2022 Applicant had been to eight \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsessions. As part of MAT, Applicant is now taking a prescription medication that helps \nfight opioid addiction. Applicant is to be commended for finally attempting to conquer his \naddiction. However, at this time, it is simply too soon to find that he is finally and firmly \nrecovered from his addiction issues. The weight of his signed statement of intent under \nAG \u00b6 26(b)(3) is lessened by his statement that he cannot commit to not seeing his family, \nmany of whom use marijuana. I have also considered the fact that his father illegally gave \nhim the Suboxone during some period of his addiction. AG \u00b6 26(d) does not apply since \nthere is no evidence in the record to show \u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug \ntreatment program.\u201d Applicant has not met his burden. Paragraph 1 is found against \nApplicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard\nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs stated above, Applicant has an extensive history of drug abuse, including drug-\nrelated arrests and purchase of illegal drugs, that ended approximately three months \nbefore the record closed. The stated disqualifying condition applies to the facts of this \ncase, transferring the burden to Applicant to mitigate the adverse inferences supported \nby his admitted conduct. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted adverse conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation or duress. \nFor the reasons stated under Paragraph 1, above, I find Applicant has not \nsufficiently mitigated the security significance of his drug usage and related criminal \nconduct under this guideline. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for criminal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 30, which states: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAs stated above, Applicant has an extensive history of illegal drug abuse, including \ndrug-related arrests and purchase of illegal drugs, that ended approximately three months \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nbefore the record closed.

Two have possible \napplication to the facts of this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nFor the reasons stated under Paragraph 1, above, I find Applicant has not \nsufficiently mitigated the security significance of his drug usage and related criminal \nconduct under this guideline. Paragraph 3 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has just started the \nlong road to recovery from opioid addiction, after years of illegal drug use that started in \n2006. At this time, he is not eligible for a security clearance. He has not mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his substance misuse, personal conduct, and criminal conduct. The \npotential for pressure, coercion, or duress still exists. Based on the current state of the \nrecord, he has also not shown that there is little likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the \nrecord evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

He had worked for another defense contractor from 2013 to 2020. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct that creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant admitted both allegations under this guideline. 1.a. Applicant was arrested on December 28, 2016, and charged with Felony Assault with a Deadly Weapon. Applicant stated that he was extremely intoxicated that night and does not really remember the event. However, Applicant admitted he hit another person in the head with a glass during a bar fight. The glass broke, the other person was injured, and Applicant was arrested. Applicant subsequently pled guilty in May 2017 to the Assault with a Deadly Weapon charge.

According to Applicant his clearance was revoked \ndue to the criminal charges set forth in paragraph 1, above. (Government Exhibit 1 at \nSection 25.) \n3.a. Applicant used marijuana on various occasions from approximately February \n2003 until July 2019. As stated, between January 2015 and March 2017 Applicant was \ngranted access to classified information. He used marijuana daily from June to December \n2018. Applicant stopped use for several months until he last used marijuana with an ex-\ngirlfriend in July 2019. (Government Exhibit 4 at pages 8-19.) \n3.b. Applicant used cocaine on various occasions from May 2010 to December \n2018. As stated, between January 2015 and March 2017 Applicant was granted access \nto classified information. He used cocaine weekly during 2017. He used cocaine daily \nduring 2018 until his last use around New Year\u2019s 2018/19. (Government Exhibit 4 at pages \n19-20.) \n3.c. Applicant used cocaine at work while employed by a defense contractor in \n2018. He stated in his Answer, \u201cI used at an unclassified site with no classified information \npresent, nor any secure rooms or locations present at the facility.\u201d (Government Exhibit 4 \nat pages 19-20.) \n3.d. Applicant used Ecstasy one time in June 2010 and a second time in July 2018. \nIt is further alleged that Applicant\u2019s 2018 use of Ecstasy occurred while he was granted \naccess to classified information. The record is unclear as to whether he actually had \naccess in July 2018. He stated in his Answer that his clearance was under reinvestigation \nat that time, and he may have had an interim clearance. However, Government Exhibit 5, \na DISS/CATS Incident Report, stated Applicant\u2019s \u201cEligibility Level\u201d was \u201cnone.\u201d The \ndocument also stated, under \u201cEligibility Determination,\u201d \u201c\u2019No Determination Made\u2019 made \non 2019-02-11 by DoD CAF.\u201d (Internal punctuation added for clarity.) (Government \nExhibit 4 at pages 20, 24; Tr. 51-52.) Given the state of the evidence this allegation is \nfound for Applicant. \n3.e. Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms one time in about November 2018. \nIt is further alleged that Applicant\u2019s 2018 use of hallucinogenic mushrooms occurred while \nhe was granted access to classified information. The record is unclear as to whether he \nactually had access in July 2018.

(Government Exhibit 4 at pages 20-21, 24; Tr. 51-52.) Given the state of the \nevidence this allegation is found for Applicant. \n3.f. Applicant admitted that he used marijuana, cocaine, Ecstasy and \nHallucinogenic Mushrooms between at least May 2017 and July 2019 as set forth above. \nDuring that period, he was prohibited from using any illegal drugs under the terms of his \nprobation. He stated in his Answer that his use, including daily use of cocaine and \nmarijuana, was because, \u201cI was under extreme depression and anxiety due to the \ncircumstances that arose from my arrest in December 2016 as stated in subparagraph \n1.a.\u201d (Answer; Government Exhibit 4 at pages 18-21; Tr. 49.) \nWith regard to his drug use, as well as his alcohol use, Applicant stated that he \nmade a conscious decision at the end of 2018 to stop using all the substances in order to \nlive a better, healthier life. He also stated that his decision was the result of a religious \nawakening in his life. Applicant testified that his management is aware of his past. \nHowever, no additional information was forwarded by Applicant from his current \nemployers setting forth the extent of their knowledge. (Government Exhibit 4 at 18; Tr. \n42-48, 54-55.) \nParagraph 4 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has falsified material facts during the clearance screening process. In \naddition, it is alleged that Applicant engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant admitted both allegations under this paragraph with explanations. \n4.a. The Government alleges in this subparagraph that all of the information set \nforth under paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, above, is also cognizable under this guideline. \n4.b. Applicant submitted an e-QIP on January 11, 2018. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nSection 23 concerned Illegal Use of Drugs and Drug Activity. Applicant was specifically \nasked, \u201cIn the last (7) seven years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cYes.\u201d He disclosed marijuana use between 2003 and \n2013, cocaine use in 2010, and Ecstasy use in 2010. These were false answers to \nrelevant questions about Applicant\u2019s drug involvement. In his Answer, Applicant explained \nthis conduct: \nNote that while I falsified information at this time, I was using alcohol and \ndrugs and was not applying my best judgment.

(Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23; Government Exhibit \n4 at pages 18-21, 25; Tr. 50.) \nMitigation \nThe pastor of Applicant\u2019s church testified on his behalf. The witness has known \nApplicant for three years. He testified at length about what the witness views as \nApplicant\u2019s personal growth in the past three years. The witness had knowledge of the \nallegations in the SOR. He stated that Applicant has been open with him about his \nconduct and about his battle with alcohol and drugs. Applicant provides substantial \nfinancial support to the church. The witness believes Applicant to be trustworthy. \n(Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 17-40.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for criminal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 30, which states: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nApplicant was arrested in 2016 and convicted in 2017 for the offense of Assault \nwith a Deadly Weapon. He served five years formal, supervised probation that ended in \nMay 2022. During almost the entirety of his probation time Applicant was violating his \nprobation by drinking alcohol and using illegal drugs. All three disqualifying conditions \napply to his conduct. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct. Two have possible application \nto the facts of this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s arrest for a serious offense occurred in 2016. The problem is his five \nyears of formal, supervised probation only ended in May 2022, and he was violating his \nprobation almost daily the entire time. Adding to those concerns is the fact that Applicant \nknowingly deceived the probation department by not reporting his infractions. He stated \nthat the probation officers never asked him in five years of monthly contact if he was using \nalcohol or drugs. Even assuming that to be true, the responsibility was his to maintain the \nterms of his probation, not for them to ferret it out. There is a paucity of evidence from \nwhich to find that Applicant has met either of the mitigating conditions with regard to his \nhistory of criminal conduct. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant had a serious, alcohol-related arrest in 2016 while he was binge drinking. \nHe also was using alcohol excessively until December 2018. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply to this case. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 23 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nApplicant admitted that he had a serious alcohol problem up to December 2018. \nAt that time, he decided to change his life and stop drinking. This was partially due to a \nprofound religious experience that has helped him achieve and maintain sobriety. \nHowever, once again, his conduct must also be examined in the context of his repeated \nprobation violations. Under the particular circumstances of this case the mitigating \nevidence is insufficient to justify a finding in Applicant\u2019s behalf. Paragraph 2 is found \nagainst Applicant. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana and cocaine on a frequent basis until 2018. His use of \nthe drugs was daily in 2018. Applicant used illegal drugs at his place of employment \nduring 2018. His drug use also occurred while he was on probation, and while he held his \nprevious security clearance, as set forth at length above. The stated disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana and cocaine on a frequent basis for about eight years. \nHe ended cocaine use in December 2018, marijuana use in June 2019. Applicant stopped \nusing drugs because he wished to change his life and because of the profound religious \nexperience that occurred about the same time. However, it has to be realized that \nApplicant\u2019s drug use also occurred during the time he was on probation for the Assault \nwith a Deadly Weapon conviction. In addition, he failed to notify probation of his violations. \nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, his actions continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Paragraph 3 as a whole is found \nagainst Applicant. \nParagraph 4 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant falsified his 2018 security clearance questionnaire in answering \nquestions about his drug use history. In addition, he has a criminal conviction, long-term \nalcohol and drug issues, and repeatedly violated the terms of his probation. The above \ndisqualifying conditions have application in this case. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged falsification and adverse conduct: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation or duress. \nApplicant admitted falsifying his 2018 e-QIP out of fear that his repeated violation \nof the terms of his probation would be reported to authorities. That fear controlled a lot of \nApplicant\u2019s activities. His conduct deprived the state of knowing the true extent of his \nability to fulfill the terms of his probation. This fear of discovery and his conduct in not \ntelling the state about his conduct continued until the end of his probation in May 2022, \njust three months before the hearing in this case. Insufficient mitigation is shown. \nParagraph 4 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While there is some evidence \nApplicant has changed many things in his life for the better, he has obvious issues being \naccountable for his own adverse conduct. He has not mitigated the concerns regarding \nhis criminal conduct, alcohol abuse, substance misuse, and personal conduct. He has not \nminimized the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. He has also not shown that \nthere is little likelihood of recurrence at this time. Overall, the record evidence creates \nsubstantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.d and 3.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4: Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a and 4.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009. 1 He is married with a child from the marriage, a child from a previous relationship, and a stepchild. (Tr. at 21-23; GE 1, 4) Applicant had financial issues about 10 to 12 years ago after his oldest child\u2019s mother moved out. He worked for a number of defense contractors in the same geographic area from 2013 through 2021. By 2020, with the exception of his student loans, his finances had stabilized. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected his wife\u2019s employment. He was working remotely, so he could work from anywhere. In October 2021, they moved to a state with better financial opportunities. In about January 2022, Applicant lost his remote job when his employer required their workers to return to the facility. He was unemployed until he obtained his current job in September 2022.

(Tr. at 21-23; GE 1, 4) \nApplicant had financial issues about 10 to 12 years ago after his oldest child\u2019s \nmother moved out. He worked for a number of defense contractors in the same \ngeographic area from 2013 through 2021. By 2020, with the exception of his student \nloans, his finances had stabilized. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected his \nwife\u2019s employment. He was working remotely, so he could work from anywhere. In \nOctober 2021, they moved to a state with better financial opportunities. In about \nJanuary 2022, Applicant lost his remote job when his employer required their workers to \nreturn to the facility. He was unemployed until he obtained his current job in September \n2022. (Tr. at 19-23, 26-28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-5; AE A) \nThe SOR alleges three defaulted federal student loans with balances totaling \nabout $122,550; $13,381 owed for a timeshare; a credit card that was $928 past due \nwith a $7,418 balance; and three debts to the same credit union that were past due for a \ntotal of $1,474. The debts are listed on one or more credit reports. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans were in deferment until about 2017. He did not \nrealize that they were no longer deferred, and he did not pay them. His federal student \nloan payments were paused pursuant to COVID-19 relief. He is not required to make \nthe loan payments. The pause was extended several times. It is currently extended \nthrough June 2023. (Tr. at 25-37, 40-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A, F) \nApplicant\u2019s application for loan relief under the Student Loan Debt Relief Plan \nwas approved. Because of the college he attended, he may be eligible for additional \nrelief. A number of lawsuits were filed challenging the program. The Department of \nEducation informed Applicant: \nWe reviewed your application and determined that you are eligible for loan \nrelief under the Plan. We have sent this approval on to your loan servicer. \nYou do not need to take any further action. \nUnfortunately, a number of lawsuits have been filed challenging the \nprogram, which have blocked our ability to discharge your debt at present. \nWe believe strongly that the lawsuits are meritless, and the Department of \nJustice has appealed on our behalf. Your application is complete and \napproved, and we will discharge your approved debt if and when we \nprevail in court. We will update you when there are new developments. \n(AE A) \nApplicant has consistently and credibly denied that he purchased a timeshare. \nHe and his wife traveled to Mexico in 2019 for the sales pitch, but he insists that he \nnever signed a sales contract, and he only became aware of the debt when it appeared \non a credit report. The debt is reported by TransUnion and Experian on the July 2020 \ncombined credit report. He retained a company to help him dispute inaccurate items on \nhis credit report.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted student loans \nand delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant had some financial issues about 10 to 12 years ago after his oldest \nchild\u2019s mother moved out. By 2020, with the exception of his student loans, his finances \nwere stable. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected his wife\u2019s employment. In \nOctober 2021, he moved his family to a state with better financial opportunities. In about \nJanuary 2022, he lost his remote job when his employer required their workers to return \nto the facility. He was unemployed until he obtained his current job in September 2022. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not been employed that long, but he made strides in addressing \nhis finances. His student loans are paused. His application for loan relief under the \nStudent Loan Debt Relief Plan was approved, and he may be eligible for additional \nrelief. He credibly disputed owing the timeshare debt. Three of the four remaining debts \nare current or being paid, and he is in discussions with the credit union for the fourth \ndebt. He credibly testified that he plans to continue to pay his debts, and he will pay his \nstudent loans when the pause is over and the lawsuit resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, but perfection is not required. A security \nclearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a procedure designed to \nevaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to \nestablish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish \na plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions to implement the \nplan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts \nsimultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid \nfirst. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant established that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and \nhe took significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances and made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His finances do not cast \ndoubt on his current judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a; he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d; and he denied the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.a, all with explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned an associate degree in 2014 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. He is pursuing a master\u2019s degree through his employer. He has worked as a research engineer for a university 2 research institute since September 2019, with a clearance. He has an annual salary of $105,000, plus a bonus. (GE 1; Tr. 9, 53-55, 112-113) The SOR concerns four criminal offenses, three of which occurred when Applicant was between the ages of 18 and 21. In November 2008, Applicant, then age 18, was living with his parents. Police came to the home while investigating a serious crime in the neighborhood and asked to search the home for suspects. When his parents allowed police to search Applicant\u2019s room, they found an ounce of marijuana. Applicant went to the police station for questioning, and he was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana along with a friend.

The \ncase was assigned to me on June 1, 2023. On August 16, 2023, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling the hearing for September 15, 2023. \nThe Government\u2019s Exhibit List is Hearing Exhibit (HE) II. In a January 2022 letter \nto Department Counsel (HE I), Applicant objected to certain Government exhibits and \nother matters. HE III is the Government\u2019s Discovery letter, and HE IV (not identified as \nsuch during the hearing) is Applicant\u2019s Exhibit list. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Governments \nExhibits (GE) 1 through GE 8. GE 1-3 were admitted without objection, and GE 4-8 \nwere admitted over Applicant\u2019s objections. (HE I; Tr. 11-16, 25). Applicant\u2019s first 8 \nExhibits on HE IV (numbered 1-21) are the same as GE 1-8, so only Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) 9 through 21 (some in subparts) were offered at the hearing. AE 9-17, \n18a, 18b, 19a, 19b, 20, 21a, 21b, and 21c were all admitted without objection. AE 18 \nand 19 were withdrawn. (Tr. 29-40) Applicant also testified. After the hearing, Applicant \nprovided one additional document (AE 22), which was admitted without objection. The \nrecord closed on September 21, 2023. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nSeptember 22, 2023. \nPre-hearing Objections \nIn his January 2022 letter to Department Counsel (HE I), Applicant\u2019s counsel \nraised several evidentiary matters that I addressed at the start of the hearing. He \nobjected to admission of GE 4 through GE 8, as noted above, and the objections were \noverruled. (HE 1; Tr. 11-16, 25) He objected to the inclusion of Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.a) \nin the SOR and to the offense at SOR \u00b6 1.d as a current security concern and as part of \nthe Government\u2019s prima facie case. (HE 1) Those objections were overruled. (Tr. 16-19) \nFindings of Fact  \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a; he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d; and he \ndenied the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.a, all with explanations. His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned \nan associate degree in 2014 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. He is pursuing a master\u2019s \ndegree through his employer.

(GE 1; Tr. 9, 53-55, 112-113) \nThe SOR concerns four criminal offenses, three of which occurred when \nApplicant was between the ages of 18 and 21. In November 2008, Applicant, then age \n18, was living with his parents. Police came to the home while investigating a serious \ncrime in the neighborhood and asked to search the home for suspects. When his \nparents allowed police to search Applicant\u2019s room, they found an ounce of marijuana. \nApplicant went to the police station for questioning, and he was arrested and charged \nwith possession of marijuana along with a friend. In March 2009, he pleaded guilty to a \ncharge of public nuisance and was fined $390. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) (GE 1 at 49; GE 2 at 5, 12) \nApplicant engaged in marijuana use between 2008 and 2011, but he has not done so \nsince then. He has no other drug-related citations or charges. (Answer; GE 2 at 6, GE 3; \nTr. 86-88) \nIn April 2011, when he was 21, Applicant was attending a friend\u2019s birthday party \nat an apartment complex. A police report indicates that he and another person were \ndriving recklessly (\u201claying drag\u201d) in the parking lot. A neighborhood \u201ccourtesy officer,\u201d \nMr. K. (an off-duty police officer who lived there) gave the men a \u201ccriminal trespass \nwarning\u201d and warned them not to return to the property, including to collect their cars, \nsince the men had been drinking. Applicant left and walked to a friend\u2019s house nearby. \nWhen he returned to the property hours later to retrieve his car and drive home, he was \nheld at gunpoint by Mr. K and charged with criminal trespass when police arrived. The \npolice report reflects that the arresting officer smelled alcohol on both men. The case \nwas nolle prossed in July 2011 and he was told not to return to the property. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c) (Answer; GE 1 at 50-51; GE 2 at 6, 11, GE 6, GE 8) \nApplicant was at the party and said it was \u201ca bit loud,\u201d which made Mr. K upset \nbecause he lived in the unit below. Applicant denied drag racing in the parking lot, but \nsaid he pulled out \u201cmore quickly than [Mr. K] had liked.\u201d (Tr. 80-81) He denied \nconsuming alcohol that evening, but said it was possible that was why he was not \nallowed to drive away or come back later for his car. Applicant went around the corner \nto a friend\u2019s house. When he returned later to get his car to go to work. Mr. K was in the \nparking lot. He called police and held Applicant at gunpoint until police arrived. Applicant \ndenied threatening Mr. K. (Answer; Tr. 80-86, 89-93) \nMonths later, in September 2011, Applicant drove to the same apartment \ncomplex and dropped a friend off. He was pulled over by police when he was leaving \nthe property. He had forgotten that he was barred from the property when his friend \nasked to be dropped off there. He called it a \u201cdumb, absent-minded thing.\u201d (Tr. 71) \nWhen Applicant attempted to converse with the arresting officers while he was being \nhandcuffed, he was subdued with a taser. He was arrested and charged with criminal \ntrespass and two counts of willful obstruction of law enforcement officers. In December \n2011, Applicant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal trespass and the other two \ncounts were dismissed. He was sentenced to two days in jail (time served), 12 months \nof probation and 24 hours of community service, which he completed.

(Answer; GE 1 at 51-52; GE 2 at 6-7, 12; GE 5, GE 7; Tr. 70-80, 93-\n98, 116-117)  \nIn March 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with two domestic violence \n(DV) offenses: felony aggravated assault-strangulation and simple battery. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nHe disclosed the charges on his April 2021 SCA and discussed them in his June 2021 \nbackground interview and noted that they were still pending. (GE 1 at 47-48 GE 2 at 5) \nHe said he kept his employer\u2019s security office informed as to the status of the case. (Tr. \n114-115) \nApplicant explained that he had known C for about 15 years. They met and dated \nin high school. They had dated occasionally but had spent years out of touch, until they \nreconnected in April 2020 when she moved back home from out of state. They began \ndating again but Applicant did not want to renew a serious relationship. In part, he said, \nthis was because he had learned that C was involved with recreational drugs, like \nmarijuana. (GE 2 at 5; AE 10; Tr. 56-57, 98-101) \nOn the night in question, in March 2021, Applicant and C went out for an evening \nof bowling. He said when he picked her up at her house, she had a \u201cbig gulp\u201d of wine or \nliquor, 9-12 inches tall. He believed she was intoxicated. (Tr 45-46, 64) They each had \none long island iced tea at the first bowling alley. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 101) \nApplicant and C went to another bowling alley and got there 30 minutes before \nclosing. He spoke to a woman behind the counter about keeping a lane open for them \nto use until closing time. He said C was upset because Applicant was talking to this \nwoman, and she left the bowling alley. Applicant and C then drove to his house, where \nhe hoped to \u201csmooth things over\u201d and relax. His house was closer than hers, so they \nwent there. (Tr. 59-61, 101-103) \nApplicant said C was upset and irate on the drive home. This continued when \nthey arrived at his house. (Tr., 62) He said he went to his room and told her to leave. He \ngave her money (for the ride share) and she left. He heard her outside crying. (Tr. 45-\n48, 62-63, 104) He denied grabbing her with both hands, choking her, lifting her up and \nslamming her down. He said he never touched her. He said she was intoxicated. They \neach had a long island iced tea at the bowling alley, and she continued drinking rum at \nhis house when they got there. (Tr. 63-64, 66) He did not see C again after she left that \nevening. He went to sleep. He denied hearing the police when they knocked on his \ndoor. He said his first interaction with police was the next day, when he was arrested. \n(Tr. 47, 66-67,104-105) \nThe police report indicates that they were called to Applicant\u2019s apartment around \nmidnight. When they arrived, they found C outside crying uncontrollably. C said she and \nApplicant had gone to the bowling alley and gotten into an argument.

Applicant \nthen re-engaged, she called him a liar, and he became enraged and choked her, \nplacing both of his hands on her, slamming her down on her back on the kitchen floor. \nShe told the officer she could not breathe, and she described her pain level as \u201c10\u201d on a \nscale of 1-10. (GE 4 at 5) \nThe investigating officer noted that he looked at C\u2019s neck and \u201cdidn\u2019t see any \nphysical injury\u201d either there or on the back of her head. C declined medical treatment \nand declined an ambulance. The officer noted an odor of alcohol on C\u2019s breath but \nnoted that she did not appear intoxicated. She said she was not sure if Applicant had \nbeen drinking, but she said that they both had used marijuana that evening. (GE 4 at 5-\n6) Applicant denied using marijuana that evening. (Tr. 65-66) \nThe report indicated that C said that Applicant \u201cwas a good person and he has \nnever physically hurt her in the past. She stated he has a good job and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to \nruin his life\u201d by going to jail because of this incident. Police officers\u2019 attempts to engage \nwith Applicant that evening were unsuccessful, as he did not come to the door. C left \nthe premises via a ride service. (GE 4 at 6; Tr, 104) Applicant was later charged as \nalleged. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nApplicant began his testimony by repeatedly asserting that \u201cthe allegations \nagainst me never happened. They were fabricated,\u201d and \u201csimply did not happen.\u201d (Tr. \n41, 106; Answer) He denied hitting or choking C, and said, \u201cnone of those allegations \nare true.\u201d (Tr. 44, 118) He believes C fabricated the police report in an effort to retaliate \nagainst him for rebuffing her romantic interest. (Tr. 56-57) He denied putting his hands \non her in any way. (Tr. 106) He and C have not spoken since that evening. (Tr. 106) \nIn January 2022, prosecutors agreed, with the victim\u2019s consent, to allow \nApplicant to enter into a diversion program. It included supervised probation and 40 \nhours of community service. He was also required to abstain from alcohol and drugs. \nHe completed the program, in June 2022. Once that occurred, the case was nolle \nprossed. (AE 9, 11, 18a, 18b; Tr. 68-70, 106-107) \nApplicant also began anger management counseling in September 2021, \nfollowing an assessment. Applicant\u2019s explanation to the assessor about what happened \nwith C is fairly similar to his other explanations. He \u201cadamantly denies not [sic] putting \nhis hands on the young lady.\u201d (AE 19a at 3) He reported that he stopped smoking \nmarijuana at age 21. The licensed professional counselor noted that the precipitating \nincident appears to be \u201cisolated and a one-time incident\u201d though she noted that he had \nan \u201calleged physical altercation without diffusing it.\u201d A four-week anger management \ncourse was recommended.

He has had no \nother subsequent criminal charges. (Tr. 43, 49-50, 87-88, 106-112, 122-123; Answer) \nApplicant acknowledged mistakes. It had been years since he had been in \ntrouble with police.

He allowed himself to get \u201csucked in\u201d \nto a bad situation that jeopardized his career and his family. Applicant\u2019s life is \n\u201cexponentially\u201d better than it was when he was in his early 20s. He loves his job and is \ndedicated to his profession.

(AE 20) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 details the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was charged with three misdemeanor offenses between ages 18 and \n21, including a marijuana possession charge at 18 (in 2008) and two criminal \ntrespassing charges at the same apartment complex months apart at age 21, in 2011. \nHe was also arrested on felony aggravated assault and simple assault domestic \nviolence charges in March 2021. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe misdemeanor offenses from years ago are mitigated by the passage of time. \nApplicant exercised some instances of poor judgment in possessing marijuana as a \nteenager and in being in the wrong place at the wrong time at the apartment complex. \nHe matured, got away from that environment, and has not been back. He also worked \nhis way through school, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, and has established an excellent \ncareer in his field. He continues to pursue professional and educational opportunities for \nimprovement. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) fully apply to his earlier offenses. \nThe DV charges are more serious and more recent, as they involve allegations of \naggravated assault and serious bodily harm. Applicant strenuously denied harming C in \nany way and denied putting his hands on her. It is hard to know what really happened \nthat evening, particularly when the police report does not corroborate evidence of \nphysical violence and C declined medical treatment at the scene. Applicant was \nrecommended for a pretrial diversion program, including community service and anger \nmanagement counseling. The counselor felt that the incident was an isolated, one-time \nepisode. Applicant has not had any contact with C since then. He only completed the \nrequired anger management counseling sessions, and the other requirements of the \ndiversion program and the case was nolle prossed in June 2022. Applicant is also \ncredited with continuing to pursue anger management counseling on an ongoing basis. \nApplicant is also highly regarded at work. While the offense is recent, it is also isolated, \nand Applicant fulfilled and exceeded the requirements of the diversion program. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n32(a) and 32(d) apply to mitigate resulting criminal conduct security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative proceedings. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) any disruptive, \nviolent, or other inappropriate behavior. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is merely an additional cross-allegation, under Guideline E, of conduct \nalready alleged and \u201cexplicitly covered\u201d under Guideline J, as it is more properly \naddressed as criminal conduct. AG \u00b6 16(d) is therefore not established. Because \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is fully addressed under Guideline J, above, I consider the personal \nconduct cross-allegation to be duplicative, and I find SOR \u00b6 2.a for Applicant on that \nbasis. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has mitigated security concerns relating to his past conduct. He \nparticipated in and completed a diversion program and has continued with anger \nmanagement counseling. He has an established career in which he excels and is highly \nvalued. He testified credibly that he will not find himself in position where he might \njeopardize his clearance and his career. I conclude that criminal conduct and personal \nconduct security concerns are mitigated. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

(RE4 at 2.) In August 2022, the Department of Education informed him he had \nrehabilitated his student loans and that the loans had \u201cbeen paid in full with the proceeds \nof the consolidation loan. (RE2.) He is current on his monthly payments. As of November \n2022, the balance was $88,546. His repayment status is listed as \u201cgood standing.\u201d (RE5.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.

May 1, 2012). \nApplicant's admissions that he had been unable to pay the full monthly amount of \npayment or in some months not at all after graduation and that he stopped payments \nwhen the lender was sued along with the documentary evidence in the FORM establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established. Applicant's delinquent debts arose during a period of \nunderemployment shortly after earning his degree. Once the student loans were out of \nthe COVID-19 forbearance program he consolidated the loans. He has established a \nhistory of repayment on the consolidated debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant documents the litigation involving the loan \nholder and the reason he believed his loans were in litigation. His improved employment \nstatus after period of underemployment has coincided with his track record of paying his \ndebts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established. Applicant provided evidence to support his assertions \nthat he has a plan to resolve his financial problems and has taken significant action to \nimplement that plan. Applicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but \nperfection is not required. Under the limited circumstances of this case, I find that his \nfinances no longer generate questions about his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. Security concerns about his finances are \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole- \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n        \n    \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have considered the character statements, Enclosures 1 and 2, in my \nwhole-person analysis, as well as his statement of intent, Enclosure 5. An administrative \njudge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nFor Applicant \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F: \n     Subparagraphs 1.a-1.v:\nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He later discussed his \nfinancial issues in a background interview. (Items 3, 4) \nThe SOR details seven delinquent debts, totaling about $37,000. They are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, and by the credit reports in the record, from \nFebruary 2020, October 2021, and January 2022.

The record did not indicate that he participated in credit counseling \nthrough the debt relief company, or otherwise. He also provided no details about his \ncurrent assets, employment situation, or income stream, to determine the reasonableness \nof his efforts to resolve his debts. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant incurred numerous debts in recent years, related to his divorce in 2018, \nand other matters. The debts are established by the credit reports in the record, and by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nEven if they are covered by an agreement with a debt relief company, Applicant\u2019s \ndebts are largely ongoing and unresolved. They continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant stated that his delinquent debts began with his divorce, in 2018. He also \nwas impacted by an accident in which his car was totaled. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore has some \napplication since his finances were impacted by circumstances beyond his control. \nHowever, for full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must also show that his subsequent actions \nare reasonable under the circumstances. Applicant has shown only that he has entered \ninto a debt relief program (and has resolved one other debt). He provided no details about \nhis payments or other arrangements with the debt relief company. He did not establish \nthat AG \u00b6 20(b) should apply. \nFor similar reasons, Applicant did not establish that he has undertaken a good-\nfaith effort to resolve his debts, typically by establishing a track record of steady payments \ntowards his creditors (through the debt relief company, or otherwise). He did not establish \nthat AG \u00b6 20(d) should apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply, as Applicant did not show that he has participated in \ncredit counseling or that his debts are being resolved or are under control. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Given the limited documentation in this case, \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his delinquent debts, even if they \noccurred due to a decline in income following his divorce in 2018. Since Applicant \nrequested a decision on the written record, I did not have the opportunity to question him \nin a hearing about the status of his SOR debts, to better assess the reasonableness of \nhis actions in addressing them. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. This does not mean that \nApplicant cannot establish at a later date that he is taking reasonable steps to resolve his \ndebts, but at this time, he has not shown that he has done enough to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations due to his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(Tr. 20-38, 73-91; GE 5, 6, 7; \nAE G, H) \nThe SOR alleges about $30,000 of delinquent debt, including: $21,876 of student \nloan debt, $1,830 of medical debt, and $6,553 of consumer debt. The status of the \nallegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.f are federal student loans in collection totaling $21,876. \nApplicant attended college between 2010-2015.

In 2017, he made some $115 monthly \npayments, but these stopped in early 2018 because he could not afford them with his \nsalary and monthly expenses at the time. In December 2022, he contacted the lender to \nenroll in a fresh start program.

(AE I) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports, bankruptcy filings, and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.f) are \nin \u201ccurrent\u201d status, and the lender has halted repayment pending the completion of \nlitigation of the President\u2019s loan forgiveness program. He contacted the lender to establish \na fresh start program when his finances stabilized after his bankruptcy. Applicant \nconsulted with a debt consolidation expert and a credit repair expert to resolve his \ndelinquent debts and stabilize his finances. They advised him to consult with a bankruptcy \nattorney. Applicant did so, and filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy to discharge many of his debts. \nHe used legal and proper means to address his delinquent debt and get a fresh start \nfinancially. His seeking of expert and professional advice about his finances, and use of \nthe legal system to file bankruptcy are viewed as responsible behavior in this case. \nApplicant\u2019s financial hardships mainly occurred from 2018 to mid-2021, and he has \ntaken appropriate steps to resolve debts that became delinquent during this time period. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) only partially applies since he did not submit sufficient documentation to show \nthat all of his debts are paid or being resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. Applicant\u2019s financial hardships were caused by temporary \nunemployment and circumstances beyond his control. He has acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances by seeking expert advice, filing bankruptcy, and contacting creditors \nto resolve debts and arrange payment plans. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies. Applicant has received financial counseling from legitimate and \ncredible sources, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control. \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence that he has undertaken good-faith efforts to \naddress his debts. Applicant is not required to show that he has paid or resolved all of his \ndebts, or that he has done so in any particular way. He has a reasonable plan to resolve \nhis debts and has implemented it. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. While Applicant appears to have a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of some of his past-due debt, he did not provide documented proof \nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or of actions to resolve the issues. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his character letters. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 9, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 30, 2022 (Answer), and he requested \na hearing before an administrative judge.

Both their names were on the title and \nthe mortgage, and they had agreed to share in the costs of ownership, which included the \n2 \n\n \nmonthly $2,100 mortgage and $804 HOA fees. He notified his mortgage company and \nthe HOA about his financial issues, but neither were willing to accommodate his \ncircumstances because his condominium was underwater. He unsuccessfully attempted \nto find a roommate. He also tried on multiple occasions, to no avail, to contact his brother \nto ask him to continue to honor his financial obligations for their condominium. The HOA \nobtained its first judgment against him in 2014. Beginning in 2015, he limited his tax \nwithholdings from his paycheck so that he would have more money available to pay his \nmortgage, HOA fees, and other expenses. He knew he would not be able to pay his \noutstanding taxes during tax season. He contacted several tax professionals to assist him \nbut could not afford their services. He also tried to use tax software to prepare his income \ntax returns on his own, but the software did not permit him to go as far back as he needed, \nand he did not feel equipped to do them. He did not file his relevant federal and state \nincome tax returns or pay his income taxes. He testified: \nWell, it started with 2015. I knew that I would probably owe a lot. And I was \nyoung, I was scared as far as owing a lot. And I just -- yeah, I was scared. . \n. .

He moved out of the \ncondominium in 2017. His condominium was foreclosed, and the HOA obtained the \nsecond judgment against him. When Applicant was unemployed from June 2020 to \nNovember 2020, he could no longer afford to stay afloat, and he obtained credit cards \nand loans to make ends meet.

He retained a tax resolution firm in \napproximately December 2021, at a cost of $2,000, to assist him with filing his past \nincome tax returns and resolving his outstanding federal and state taxes. The firm \nsubmitted an installment agreement request on his behalf to the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS). He stated that he planned to set up a payment plan to resolve his outstanding state \ntaxes. (Tr. at 32-38, 92-94, 96-97, 99-100, 107-108, 112-114, 126; GE 1-4) \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his outstanding financial obligations were further \nimpacted when, in 2022, his sister and her husband began divorce proceedings, and \nApplicant took his sister and his five-year-old nephew into his care. With an annual salary \nof approximately $23,000 as a special education teacher, his sister\u2019s financial means are \nlimited so Applicant has given her approximately $500 monthly, and he assisted her with \npaying groceries and other expenses. (Tr. at 24-27, 107-108) \nIn August 2020, Applicant untimely filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2019, \nfor which he owed $7,083 in federal taxes. In November 2021, he untimely filed his federal \nincome tax return for TY 2018, for which he owed $9,731 in federal taxes. In June 2022, \nhe entered an installment agreement with the IRS to resolve his outstanding federal taxes \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor TY 2013 through 2020. The agreement provides for automatic deduction from his \nchecking account of $604 monthly, beginning in July 2022. In July 2022, he untimely filed \nhis federal income tax returns for TY 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2020, for which he owed \n$10,466, $8,703, $5,065, and $5,789 in federal taxes, respectively. He timely filed his \nfederal income tax returns for TY 2021 and 2022. He owed $10,218 in federal taxes for \nTY 2021, for which he reached an installment agreement in October 2022 to resolve. The \nIRS intercepted his $976 overpayment for TY 2022 and applied $783 and $192, \nrespectively, to his outstanding federal taxes for TY 2013 and 2014. His remaining \nbalance for TY 2014 was $7,170. (AE A, S) \nIRS tax account transcripts from February and March 2023 reflect that Applicant \nowes approximately $57,055 in federal taxes for TY 2014 through 2021. Applicant made \npayments, in accordance with his June 2022 installment agreement with the IRS, in July \n2022, August 2022, and September 2022. The IRS was unable to process his payments \nin November 2022, December 2022, and January 2023. Another payment, made by \nApplicant in January 2023, was pending as of the date of the hearing. He made his $604 \npayment in accordance with his payment arrangement in March 2023. He intends to \ncontinue abiding by his payment plan with the IRS. (Tr. at 28-37, 100-104, 108-112, 114-\n115; AE B, C, S) \nApplicant testified that he could not recall receiving any documentation related to\nhis state tax liens. He contacted the state tax authority directly and entered an initial \npayment plan in March 2022, consisting of $791 monthly payments for 56 months \nbeginning in April 2022, to resolve his outstanding state taxes of $38,833. He made two \npayments in April 2022, consisting of $242 and $791. He renegotiated that payment plan \nto better align with his budget and other expenses, and he entered a payment plan in \nNovember 2022, consisting of $470 monthly payments for 99 months beginning in \nDecember 2022, to resolve his outstanding state taxes of $36,758. (Tr. at 37-46, 100-\n104, 108-112, 114-115; GE 5; AE D, E, Q)\n \n \nApplicant made the following payments toward his outstanding state taxes: \npayments of $791 in May, June, July, and August 2022; an additional payment in June \n2022 of $836; three payments in February 2023 totaling $1,401; and a payment in March \n2023 of $470. He stated that he did not make any payments to the state tax authority from \nAugust 2022 to December 2022 because he was not obligated to do so while he was \nrenegotiating his payment plan, and he was late on his payments for December 2022 and \nJanuary 2023, in part because he did not receive the approval of his renegotiated \npayment plan in the mail until after the December 2022 due date. He also had to pay his \nattorney\u2019s fees for the attorney he retained to represent him at his security clearance \nhearing. He intends to continue to comply with his payment arrangement with the state \ntax authority and resolve his outstanding state taxes. (Tr. at 37-46, 100-104, 108-112, \n114-115; GE 5; AE D, E, Q) \nApplicant stated that the two HOA judgments in SOR \u00b6 1.l-1.m were entered \nagainst both him and his brother but that his brother filed bankruptcy, which left him \nresponsible for the judgments. He testified that he made payments to the HOA of $430 \nmonthly for over one year before the HOA obtained the judgments against him. He also \n4 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \ntestified that he contacted the HOA at least nine times to resolve his outstanding \njudgments. He reached a debt settlement agreement in March 2022, which provides for \nhim to pay his $68,305 balance at $400 monthly, beginning in April 2022. He testified that \nhe had since mailed his payments via check to the HOA, and he provided copies of such \nchecks from April 2022 to January 2023 but stated that the HOA had yet to deposit any \nof them. He set those funds aside in his bank account. He unsuccessfully attempted to \ncontact the attorneys that represented the HOA in obtaining the judgments against him, \nto determine why none of his checks have yet been deposited. In March 2023, he \nsuccessfully contacted the HOA, who informed him that it had not received any of his \nchecks, and he hand delivered a $3,500 cashier\u2019s check. He also made his $400 payment \nfor April 2023. He intends to continue making his payments in accordance with his \nagreement.

Applicant used \nthis card to make ends meets while trying to stay afloat on his mortgage. In March 2022, \nhe entered an agreement to settle this debt through four payments of $193. As of May \n2022, this debt was paid. (Tr. at 56-58, 92-94, 100; GE 6; AE H) \nSOR \u00b6 1.o is for the $3,124 balance due on Applicant\u2019s vehicle that was \nrepossessed in 2016. He stopped making payments while he was trying to stay afloat on \nhis mortgage. He testified that he made ten to twelve payments of $480 directly to the \ncreditor at an unrecalled date before the SOR. As of June 2022, this debt was paid.

Although Applicant indicated \nduring his May 2020 background interview that he believed this debt was a result of \nidentity theft, he testified that this was a credit card he used to pay for expenses around \nthe time he was in or leaving his condominium. He could not recall whether he made any \npayments on this debt after it became delinquent. As of June 2022, this debt was paid. \n(Tr. at 61-64, 96-98, 100; GE 2, 3, 6; AE J) \nSOR \u00b6 1.q is for a $1,546 charged-off loan for furniture that Applicant purchased \nfor his current residence. He testified that he mistakenly indicated during his May 2020 \nbackground interview that he paid this debt in January 2018. He testified that he made \nseveral payments of between $200 and $400 to this creditor at an unrecalled date. He \npaid this debt in April 2022.

The Chief Special Security Officer for Applicant\u2019s company, who \nhas served as Applicant\u2019s U.S. Government supervisor since November 2020, described \nApplicant as one of their most valued personnel security specialists. The company\u2019s \nDirector of Operations highlighted Applicant\u2019s performance from June 2017 to September \n2020, when he served as a team lead with a \u201chigh level of integrity, loyalty, and discretion.\u201d \nThe vice president and contract manager for Applicant\u2019s employer, from 2011 to 2016, \ndescribed Applicant as a dedicated and exemplary employee.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \n6 \n\n \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant has a history of not being able to pay his debts. He also failed to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns for TY 2015 through 2018 and 2020, and to pay his \nfederal income taxes for TY 2015 through 2020. He also failed to timely pay his state \nincome taxes, resulting in liens entered against him in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2021. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n7 \n\n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under his \ncircumstances. Applicant paid the consumer debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n through 1.q, and I find \nthose allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. He notified his mortgage company and his previous \nHOA about his financial issues after his brother abandoned him in 2011; he attempted to \nfind a roommate; he tried to contact his brother to ask him to continue to honor his \nfinancial obligations; he contacted several tax professionals to assist him but could not \nafford their services; he tried to use tax software to prepare his income tax returns on his \nown; and he attempted to short sale his condominium. \nHowever, once Applicant obtained gainful employment with a more substantial \nincome in November 2020, he did not retain a tax resolution firm to assist him with filing \nhis relevant federal income tax returns and resolving his outstanding federal taxes until \napproximately December 2021. He did not contact the state tax authority regarding his \nstate tax liens until March 2022. There is no evidence to corroborate his claim that he \ncontacted his previous HOA at least nine times to resolve his outstanding judgments, and \nhe only reached a debt settlement agreement with the HOA in March 2022. AG \u00b6 20(b) is \nnot established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m. \nAlthough untimely, Applicant filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2018 and \n2019 in November 2021 and August 2020, respectively, before he received the SOR. \nWith the help of the tax resolution firm, he also filed his federal income tax returns for TY \n2015 through 2017 and 2020 in July 2022. He timely filed his federal income tax returns \nfor TY 2021 and 2022, and he intends to timely file his future income tax returns. In \naddition, he has a track record of payments toward his outstanding state tax liens since \nreaching payment plans with the state tax authority in March 2022 and then November \n2022. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.h through 1.k, and \nI find those allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nOn the contrary, Applicant has only made four to five payments to the IRS in \naccordance with his June 2022 installment agreement, on an outstanding balance of \napproximately $57,055 in federal taxes for TY 2014 through 2021. His claim that he \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nmailed payments via check to his previous HOA since reaching an installment agreement \nin April 2022 to resolve his outstanding $68,305 judgments, was refuted by the HOA. He \nonly hand-delivered a cashier\u2019s check to the HOA in March 2023, and he has only made \none payment in accordance with his agreement in April 2023. While he received financial \ncounseling and he has the means to continue resolving his outstanding federal taxes and \nHOA judgments, he needs more time to establish a track record of doing so. I find that \nthese financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) do not apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.g, \n1.l, and 1.m. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h - 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l - 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n - 1.q: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

Her \nadmissions with clarifying comments are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old interpreter and linguist sponsored by a defense \ncontractor. She is a fluent speaker of the Pashtun, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi languages, \nin addition to English. She earned associate and bachelor\u2019s degrees in 1990 prior to her \narrival in the United States. (GE 1 at 16; Tr. 34-35 ) Born in Pakistan, she married a U.S. \ncitizen in 1991 and moved to the United States in 1992. She became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in April 2007, and she currently holds dual U.S. and Pakistan citizenship. (GE 1; \nTr. 29-31) \nAfter their marriage in 1991, Applicant and her husband became parents to five \nchildren ages 32, 31, 28, and 20-year-old twins. In 2007, they divorced and Applicant \nbecame the custodial parent of their five children. (GE 1; Tr. 29-31) \nFrom 2008 through about February 2012, Applicant worked part-time as a \ncommunity college instructor. She was laid off following a company-wide reduction in \nforce, and remained unemployed for about 10 months. She enrolled in college courses \nduring this period of unemployment to enhance her marketable skills. (GE 1) \nIn December 2012, Applicant found work as a defense contract linguist. After \ntraining, she deployed to Afghanistan for her duties until about July 2013. She left the \nposition after experiencing a family emergency. She was unemployed for about eight \nmonths before finding another defense contract linguist position in March 2014. She \nworked in the same position with two different defense contractors from March 2014 \nthrough about April 2016, when she was released from the contract. About four months \nof unemployment followed her release. (GE 1) \nFrom October 2016 through about June 2017, Applicant found work as a part-time \nsubstitute teacher, but was struggling financially due to not having enough work hours. \nShe moved the family to another state and was unemployed from June 2017 through \nOctober 2018. She worked as a ride-share driver during this period, and she would do \nother odd jobs to help \u201ckeep a roof over her children\u2019s heads.\u201d She did whatever she could \nto earn money. (GE 1; Tr. 48-50) During this period, she and her children lived in low \nincome, federally subsidized housing and the family received subsidized monies for food \nexpenditures. She received about $373 per month in child support payments from her ex-\nhusband, and he would reduce the amount sent every time a child would reach the age \nof 18 years. (Tr. 33-34, and 85-86) During periods of unemployment or underemployment, \nshe used personal loans and credit cards to pay housing and other essential living \nexpenses until she could find work. \nBetween 2017 and 2021, several of Applicant\u2019s extended family members died \nunexpectedly, including her bother, both parents, and a grandmother; and as the eldest \ndaughter, she was expected to contribute to the family\u2019s payment of funeral expenses \nbased on religious traditions, a moral obligation.

(GE 1 pp. 17-18; Tr. at \n36) She has been employed since she created this position, though her work is not \nsteady. Her employment at this time is sporadic: she may or may not get called for an \nassignment. She works on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis. (Tr. at 38) In between calls for work, \nshe babysits her grandchildren. Applicant currently does not have her own home or \napartment. She lives with her second-eldest daughter as she awaits more stable work as \na linguist. (Tr. 38-43) Applicant is currently financially supported by her emergency \nsavings and three of her adult children. (Tr. 39-42, and 95-97) \nFrom December 2021 through about April 2023, Applicant deployed to Kuwait and \nworked as an interpreter for a defense contractor. She received a salary of $80,000 U.S. \ndollars per year including bonuses. No hazardous duty pay was included in the \narrangement. (Tr. 43-45) The defense contractor paid for housing, but she was required \nto pay living expenses including food, water, driving/taxi service, taxes, and daily \nexpenses for the interpreter business. Her salary was paid in U.S. dollars, but she was \nrequired to conduct business in the local Kuwaiti currency, the Kuwaiti dinar, a very \nexpensive currency. (Tr. 46-47) Applicant stated she sent about $1,200 home to her \nchildren for their living expenses. Her youngest children, twins, were under 20 years old \nwhen she started the position. \nThe SOR alleges 12 financial concerns (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.l) totaling about $52,000 \nin delinquent consumer and medical debts reflected in credit bureau reports from April \n2021, November 2022, and August 2023. (GE 2, 3, and 4) The evidence in this case, \nincluding Applicant\u2019s and her witness\u2019s testimony and documents submitted in mitigation \n(AE A - AE H), is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($19,055), 1.e ($5,264), and 1.f ($3,154): Applicant admitted these \nconsumer debts, all from the same creditor, with explanation. She fell behind on payments \nduring periods of unemployed. She immediately contacted the creditor to work out revised \npayment arrangements. She was given a six-month reprieve during the COVID-19 \npandemic, and restarted payments afterwards. She provided proof of their current \nagreement, and demonstrated that she has been paying a combined amount of $100 per \nmonth spread between the three debts over an extended time. Her receipts in AE D, and \nreduced account balances reflected in GE 4: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($16,230), 1.e ($4,814), and 1.f \n($2,704); show she is following their agreement. (GE 2, 3, and 4; AE D; and Tr. 52-56) \nThese debts are being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($7,865) and 1.c ($7,623): Applicant admitted these consumer debts \nfrom the same creditor with explanation. She fell behind on her debts during periods of \nunemployment, and particularly the COVID-19 pandemic. She immediately contacted the \ncreditor to work out revised payment arrangements. She provided proof, in AE E, that she \nhas been paying $65 per month on each account for an extended time. Reduced account \nbalances are reflected in GE 3 and 4.

She \nfell behind on her debts during periods of unemployment, and particularly the COVID-19 \npandemic. In her March 2022 response to the SOR, she stated she was on a repayment \nplan with the creditor. At some point, the creditor no longer wanted to collect the debt and \nstated it was sending her a form 1099, cancellation of debt. She was working in the middle \neast at the time, and did not receive the creditor\u2019s 1099. She contacted the creditor upon \nher return to the United States. She provided notes of her communications with creditors \nwhile deployed in support of her testimony. (AE H) The creditor was unable to locate her \ndebt or provide information concerning the whereabouts of the form 1099. The debt does \nnot appear in GE 3 or 4. She is awaiting the creditor\u2019s final communication regarding the \n1099. (SOR response of March 2022; GE 2; AE H; and Tr. 71-73) This debt is being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($2,470) and 1.i ($387): Applicant admitted these consumer debts \nwith explanation. As with the other delinquent debts, Applicant fell behind on her \npayments during periods of unemployment, and particularly during the COVID-19 \npandemic. She testified the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.g was unwilling to work with her initially. \n(Tr. at 56). However, her eldest daughter helped her to pay off this delinquent debt over \ntime. She presented evidence she consistently made payments starting in about June \n2022. (AE H) Her paid receipts in AE D and H and the reduced balance reflected in GE 4 \nfor SOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,482), demonstrates she took action to repay this delinquent debt. The \ndebt is now paid off. (GE 2, 3 and 4; AE D and H; Tr. at 56, 73) Moreover, Applicant \nnegotiated settlement of the delinquent debt in SOR 1.i, and paid it off while deployed. \n(AE H; and Tr. at 78) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i appears in GE 2, but it does not appear in \nGE 3 or 4. Both debts are resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h ($870) and 1.j ($136): Applicant consistently and credibly denied \nthese medical debts. Per the 2021 credit report, these medical charges were incurred in \nabout 2016, a time when Applicant was unemployed and living in federally subsidized \nhousing. (GE 2 pp. 4-5) She testified these debts were covered by Medicaid, and she \ninitially filed documents incorrectly. She resubmitted the documents and Medicaid paid \nbalances on both accounts. (SOR response of March 2022; GE 2; Tr. at 16, 77) These \ndebts are resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k ($86) and 1.l ($327): Applicant admitted these debts with explanation. \nThe medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k, incurred in 2016, was also paid by Medicaid. (GE 2; Tr. \nat 77). This debt does not appear in GE 3 or 4. Nor does it appear in AE G. Finally, \nApplicant also submitted proof she paid off the consumer debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l in AE D. (GE \n2; AE D at 20; Tr. at 81) Both debts are resolved. \nApplicant is supported by sporadic employment as an interpreter and by three of \nher adult children who have helped her to repay delinquent debts in this SOR. She also \nhas emergency funds spread across three savings accounts. She currently resides with \nher daughter, and she has no additional bills to pay. She lives frugally, and she credibly \ntestified she is committed to resolving her remaining delinquent debts; and that she is on \ntrack to accomplish her goal in about 12 to 24 months. (Tr. at 97).

(Tr. 87-98; AE A) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the case establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial challenges began after her divorce in 2007, after she became \nthe custodial parent of five children with minimal financial support from her ex-husband. \nShe subsequently found work as a part-time community college instructor in 2008, until \nher layoff in early 2012, followed by a 10-month period of unemployment. She lifted \nherself up, taking college courses to enhance her marketable skills so that by late 2012, \nshe was competitively selected for her first linguist position and thereafter deployed for \nthe first time to the middle east. While there, she experienced a family emergency that \ncaused an early return in July 2013. An eight-month unemployment period followed \nbefore she found another comparable position in March 2014. She worked successfully \nfor two different defense contractors before being released from the contract in April 2016. \nShe was unemployed again, this time for four months. \nAdditional facts set forth in the findings of facts will not be repeated here. In short, \nover the last 10-15 years, Applicant has experienced multiple challenges beyond her \ncontrol including a divorce, multiple periods of unemployment, and unexpected deaths in \nher extended family that created moral obligations for her to contribute financially as best \nshe could. She responded to each of these challenges reasonably and responsibly. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) is applicable here. Moreover, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies under the facts of this case. \nApplicant submitted substantial evidence showing her consistent effort to repay her \ndelinquent debts, and her adherence agreed repayment plans. Applicant consistently and \ncredibly denied debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.j, supported by documentary evidence. Finally, \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies to these allegations. \nApplicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, but perfection is not required. A security \nclearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a procedure designed to \nevaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to \nestablish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a \nplan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. \nThere is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts \nsimultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant established she has a plan to resolve her remaining financial issues, \nand she has taken action to implement her plan. She has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances and made good-faith efforts to pay her delinquent debts. Although AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not fully apply because some of her debts are ongoing, her current financial \nsituation does not cast doubt on her judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. Under the facts of this case, Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns regarding her finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without any questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Subsequently, on March 28, 2022, she changed her mind \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). (Tr. 5) The case was assigned to me on April 18, 2023. \nOn May 2, 2023, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for June 1, 2023, by video-\nteleconference through an online platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled.

(GE 1) \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1997 until 2017. She held a \nclearance in the Army. She retired as a sergeant first class (E-7).

((GE 1; AE I; PH 1; Tr. \n10-11, 14, 28-36, 63-67, 74-78) \nOn her SCA, Applicant declared that she had filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in \n2016 and was then making monthly payments. (GE 1) Her debts occurred because in \n2015, her husband was transferred to a new duty station in State 2, and it was difficult to \nmaintain the expenses of two households. She also was making less money in her new \njob. (Answer; GE 2; Tr. 36-37, 55-56) She consulted a bankruptcy attorney and she said \nshe was advised to stop making payments on her bills so they would become 90 to 120 \ndays late so they could be included in the bankruptcy. (GE 2) She was paying about \n$3,800 a month into the bankruptcy plan. This included her full retirement check, plus \nother funds. (Tr. 57) She stopped making payments into the 2016 bankruptcy in 2020 \nbecause she could not keep up with them. (Tr. 58) \nApplicant\u2019s husband moved home in 2021 after he retired from the Army with 24 \nyears of service, also as an E-7. They remain legally married and they live in the same \nhouse, but they have maintained separate lives for about the last year. They divide \nmonthly expenses, though the mortgage is in her name. He receives $2,400 a month in \nretirement pay. He works as a stocker for a large retailer and is also a personal trainer. \nApplicant said the family\u2019s finances have improved because they no longer need to pay \nfor two households, though the loss of their regular Army income has also been an \nadjustment. (GE 2; Tr. 30-38, 60-61) \nApplicant receives $1,750 in retirement pay. She is also a 100% disabled veteran, \nand receives $3,950 in disability compensation from the VA.

(GE 3 \u2013 GE 5)  \nApplicant and her husband first filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in November 2007. \nThey became financially overextended when they were just starting out in the Army and \nstarting a family. The bankruptcy petition was discharged in June 2012. (GE 6; Answer) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nAs discussed above, Applicant and her husband jointly filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy in October 2016. (GE 3, GE 4, GE 7; AE A; Tr. 35) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) The 2016 \nChapter 13 bankruptcy listed about $46,812 in nonpriority unsecured claims. Secured \nclaims included Applicant\u2019s home and vehicles. They listed $9,955 in monthly income and \n$5,669 in expenses. (GE 7 at 7-8) \nApplicant explained in her Answer that her Army retirement pay went towards the \nbankruptcy balance, but she was unable to make up the difference. (Answer) She \ndocumented, however, that between October 2016 and May 2021, she had paid over \n$105,000 into the payment plan. (AE A) She said she paid about $3,000 a month into the \nbankruptcy but stopped making payments because maintaining two households made it \ntoo expensive. (Tr. 54-58) The petition was dismissed in April 2021. (GE 3) \nApplicant filed for individual Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection again in October \n2022. That bankruptcy proceeding is ongoing and will run for five years. (GE 3, GE 8, GE \n9; AE G. Tr. 41) (SOR \u00b6 1.l) She declared just under $20,000 in unsecured claims (not \nincluding secured claims such as home and vehicle). She declared $5,333 in monthly \nincome and about $3,900 in expenses. (GE 8 at 8) \nApplicant said she is paying regular monthly payments towards her bankruptcy, \nthrough an automatic withdrawal. (Tr. 38-44, 65) She documented that from October 2022 \nto June 2023, she had paid $12,620 into the bankruptcy plan, and was paying $1,915 a \nmonth.

(AE H) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has a history of financial instability and incurring delinquent debts. She \nand her husband filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection twice, in 2007 and 2016. The \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR are also admitted and established by the record \nevidence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant has filed for bankruptcy three times (twice \njointly with her husband). She made several years\u2019 worth of payments following their \nChapter 13 bankruptcy filing in 2016, but was not able to complete the payment plan, and \nthe bankruptcy was dismissed in 2021. She filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy individually in \nOctober 2022 and has been making regular monthly payments ever since. The current \nbankruptcy is ongoing, so the debts are not resolved. She has also not established that \nthe debts were incurred due to isolated, unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur. \nHowever, Applicant is given credit under AG \u00b6 20(d) for making several years\u2019 of \npayments into her prior bankruptcy (2016-2021), payments totaling over $100,000, even \nthough the debts were not fully discharged. She has also renewed making good-faith \nmonthly payments in her more recent bankruptcy filing. Further, in doing so, she has \nestablished that her debts are being resolved and are under control. The financial \ncounseling requirement of AG \u00b6 20(c) is also satisfied. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) both fully \napply. While her debts are ongoing and not fully resolved, it is likely that she will continue \nto make regular payments under her bankruptcy plan and she has the financial capacity \nto do so. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s credibility as well as her Army career as \npositive whole-person evidence in her favor. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concern shown by her delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to her continued eligibility for a security \nclearance. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nHaving considered all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with \nthe interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

The most \nrecent credit report in the record, from March 2023, states there is no past due or charge \noff amount on this account. Based on the current state of the record, I find this debt has \nnot been proved. The allegation is found for Applicant. (Government Exhibit 18 at 5, \nGovernment Exhibit 19 at 6; Tr. 67-68.) \n1.t. Applicant admitted owing a creditor $1,499 for a delinquent mobile telephone \nbill. He testified that this bill is in error, and the creditor admits it is an error, but they refuse \nto resolve it. He has taken no steps to dispute this debt with the credit reporting agencies. \nThis debt appears on the June 2019 credit report, but does not appear in the March 2023 \ncredit report.

However, his knowledge of his financial situation and the impact of his being on \ndisability status on his finances was often vague and contradictory. (Tr. 32, 76-80.) \n \nMITIGATION \nApplicant submitted a letter from his manager. The writer states, \u201c[Applicant] is a \nvaluable asset to the company.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit G.) \nPolicies \nPositions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d The \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, \ndated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases \nforwarded to the DoD and DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel \nManagement. DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures \ncontained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be \nmade. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility for a public \ntrust position, the administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in the Adjudicative Guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d), describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a \nnumber of variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable national \nsecurity eligibility decision. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information or areas seeks to enter \ninto a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. \nThis relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns, as required, for \ntax year 2010. He continues to owe delinquent taxes. He filed for bankruptcy twice and \ncontinues to have and accumulate considerable past-due indebtedness. These facts \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial issues: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nINCOME TAX ISSUES \nTurning first to Applicant\u2019s Federal income tax issues. As stated, records from the \nIRS show that his 2010 tax return was filed in 2011. He may still owe the IRS back taxes. \nHowever, he has retained an ITA firm and provided recent documentation from them \nshowing that they are in contact with the IRS. The retention of that firm by Applicant shows \ngood faith on his part. SOR 1.a and 1.c are found for Applicant. \nApplicant was unable to show that he had filed his 2010 state income tax return. \nHowever, he stated that the ITA firm was retained to resolve his state tax issues as well. \nUnder these facts, once again, he has shown good faith. The two paid state tax liens have \nno current security significance.

Given the fact that this bankruptcy \nhappened over 20 years ago, I find that it has no current security significance. By the \nsame token, the associated debts also have no current security significance.

By the same token, the associated debts also have no \ncurrent security significance. SOR 1.h, 1.l, and 1.m are found for Applicant. \nApplicant submitted insufficient evidence to show that he is in control of his current \nfinances. He was unable to show the current status of the debt in SOR 1.f. He has made \nno payments on the debts listed in SOR 1.g, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.u, and 1.x. He has made a \nsingle, minimal, payment to the creditors in SOR 1.r, 1.v, and 1.w subsequent to the \nhearing. He may have a legitimate dispute with the creditor set forth in SOR 1.t, but has \ndone nothing to document the dispute. His overall knowledge of his current financial \nsituation was poor. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. As stated, SOR 1.s, is \nfound for Applicant. The remaining current delinquent debt allegations (1.g, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, \n1.r, 1.t, 1.u, 1.v, 1.w, and 1.x) are found against Applicant, along with Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a finding of trustworthiness by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided insufficient \nevidence to show that he has resolved his financial issues, or that they will not recur in \nthe future. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress has not been reduced. \nOverall, the evidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, \nand suitability for a finding of trustworthiness.

Applicant responded to the SOR on February 8, 2022, and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on May 13, 2022. A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nHe received the FORM on May 23, 2022. He responded with emails to Department \nCounsel on June 6, 2022, and June 22, 2022. He also apparently mailed documents \ndirectly to the DOD adjudication office at Fort Meade rather than to DOHA.

The monthly payments were increased to $1,660. Applicant \ncontinued to make the monthly payments, and additional accounts were settled. (Items \n1-6; AE F) \nThe debt-settlement company had an arrangement with a bank. In June 2022, \nApplicant borrowed $17,950 from the bank, which was used by the debt-settlement \ncompany to settle the remaining 14 accounts in the DRP. He is repaying the loan \nthrough monthly payments of $925. He has made all of the required payments. He \nhopes that his actions have established that his financial affairs are back in order and \nthat he is qualified to retain his security clearance. (Items 1; AE C-G) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues were primarily related to his divorce, but were \naggravated by an injury and his support for his daughter and grandchildren. He \ncontracted with a debt-settlement company in October 2019, more than two years \nbefore the SOR was issued. He made monthly payments of $1,556, which were later \nraised to $1,660. A number of debts were settled before the SOR was issued. He \ncontinued to make the monthly payments until June 2022, when he borrowed $17,950, \nwhich was used by the debt-settlement company to settle the remaining 14 accounts in \nthe DRP. He is repaying the loan through monthly payments of $925. He has made all \nof the required payments. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant established that he had a plan to resolve his financial problems, and \nhe took significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances and made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His finances do not cast \ndoubt on his current judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.q: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He has two minor children from his third marriage who live with their mother in the United States. Applicant has been employed by his current defense contractor employer since January 2020 and seeks to retain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. He has been employed by various defense contractors in overseas locations for approximately 24 years. He is currently working at a remote location outside the continental limits of the United States (OCONUS). (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A, 15, and 17; Applicant Exhibit B.)

On January 14, 2022, \nthe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense after June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on January 29, 2022, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on May 11, 2022. The case was assigned to me on June 7, 2022. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on June 16, 2022. \nThe case was heard on August 15, 2022. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on August 24, 2022. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibit A, \nwhich was also admitted without objection. He asked that the record remain open for the \nreceipt of additional documentation. Applicant timely submitted Applicant Exhibits B \nthrough N, which were also admitted without objection, and the record closed on August \n31, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 51 years old and married to his fourth wife. She was Applicant\u2019s co-\nhabitant at the time he filled out his e-QIP. He has two minor children from his third \nmarriage who live with their mother in the United States. Applicant has been employed \nby his current defense contractor employer since January 2020 and seeks to retain \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nHe has been employed by various defense contractors in overseas locations for \napproximately 24 years. He is currently working at a remote location outside the \ncontinental limits of the United States (OCONUS). (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections \n13A, 15, and 17; Applicant Exhibit B.) \nApplicant was severely injured in a job-related accident in October 2015, according \nto his e-QIP and May 7, 2020 interview with a Government investigator. (Government \nExhibit 1 at Section 13A, Government Exhibit 3.) (Applicant testified that the accident \nhappened in October 2016, but I find the documentary evidence, which is closer in time \nto the incident, is more accurate as stating the actual date in 2015.) He suffered a \ntraumatic brain injury and severe physical injuries. He spent approximately a year in \nhospitals and rehabilitation, both for physical therapy and occupational therapy. He was \nout of work and living on his savings and worker\u2019s compensation from the date of the \naccident until May 2019. Eventually, Applicant received a monetary recovery from his \nemployer in the amount of approximately $450,000 in damages for his injuries. Applicant \nput $350,000 of the recovery into an annuity that provides him with approximately $1,000 \nof income very month. (Tr. 17-19, 37-40, 49-50, 57-59.) \nApplicant\u2019s third wife filed for divorce in August 2017, during his recovery. They \nwere divorced in January 2018. The divorce decree required Applicant to make a large \nmonetary settlement with his ex-wife. Applicant also became responsible for credit card \ndebts that were incurred by his ex-wife in Applicant\u2019s name.

He \nwas also concerned about the effect of the COVID pandemic on his employment at the \nremote location. Accordingly, Applicant has cash in his bank account. (Applicant Exhibit \nK.) He stressed that this is almost all of his savings, and he is frugal in using his money \nto pay off his delinquent debts. Starting in March 2022, when he felt financially stable \nenough to do so, he began paying the debts one at a time, starting with the smallest and \nmoving his way up. (Tr. 19, 53-54, 67-71, 76-77.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant \nadmitted all the allegations under this guideline with explanations. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had ten charged-off or past-due consumer debts \nin the total amount of approximately $39,564. Applicant is also alleged to owe back child \nsupport of approximately $4,472. The existence and amount of the debts is supported by \ncredit reports dated February 29, 2020; and May 2, 2022. They are also supported by \nApplicant\u2019s statements to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management on \nMay 7, 2020; and his responses to interrogatories issued to him by the DoD CAF on \nAugust 20, 2021. (Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4, and 5.) \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant admitted that he owed $23,470 for a collection account with a credit \nunion. This is Applicant\u2019s largest debt, and it dates to his third marriage and the period of \nrecovery from his injuries. As stated, Applicant worked at paying off his smaller debts first \nand working towards the largest ones. Now that all the debts from 1.c to 1.k have been \npaid or resolved his plan was to begin paying this debt and 1.b after the record closed. \n(Applicant Exhibit G at 2; Tr. 46-53.) This debt is not resolved, but Applicant has a plan \nto resolve it. \n1.b. Applicant admitted that he owed $10,262 for a collection account with a credit \ncard company. This is Applicant\u2019s second-largest debt, and it dates to his third marriage \nand the period of recovery from his injuries. Now that all the debts from 1.c to 1.k have \nbeen paid or resolved his plan was to begin paying this debt and 1.a after the record \nclosed. (Applicant Exhibit G at 2; Tr. 53.) This debt is not resolved, but Applicant has a \nplan to resolve it. \n1.c. Applicant admitted that he was past-due on his child support obligations in the \namount of $4,472. He supplied documentation showing that he is now current with his \nchild support obligations. The records also show that his child support is automatically \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwithdrawn from his bank account every month.

He reached a payment arrangement with the creditor and paid the debt off in July \n2022, as shown in documentation from the collection agent. (Applicant Exhibit J; Tr. 19, \n72.) This debt is resolved. \n1.e. Applicant admitted that he owed a past-due debt to a bank in the amount of \n$700. He reached a payment arrangement with the creditor and paid the debt off in July \n2022, as shown in documentation from the bank. (Applicant Exhibit I; Tr. 19, 72-73.) This \ndebt is resolved. \n1.f. Applicant admitted that he owed a past-due debt to a department store in the \namount of $636. Applicant stated in Applicant Exhibit A that he had paid this debt over \nthe telephone and provided a confirmation number from the creditor. Applicant Exhibit H \nshows a withdrawal from Applicant\u2019s bank account in the amount of $636.08. He stated \nin Applicant Exhibit L that as of August 30, 2022, he was awaiting a zero-balance letter \nfrom the creditor that was to arrive after the record closed. Based on the totality of the \nevidence, including documentation from Applicant confirming other statements about \ntelephone payments, I find that this debt is resolved. (Tr. 19, 72.) \n1.g. Applicant admitted that he owed a past-due debt to a bank in the amount of \n$587. He reached a payment arrangement with the creditor and paid the debt off in July \n2022, as shown in documentation from the collection agent. (Applicant Exhibit J; Tr. 19, \n72.) This debt is resolved. \n1.h. Applicant admitted that he owed a past-due debt to a telephone provider in \nthe amount of $561. Applicant stated in Applicant Exhibit A that he had paid this debt over \nthe telephone and provided a confirmation number from the creditor. Based on the totality \nof the evidence, including documentation from Applicant confirming other statements \nabout telephone payments, I find that this debt is resolved. (Tr. 19, 72.) \n1.i. Applicant admitted that he owed a past-due debt to a telephone provider in the \namount of $101. He reached a payment arrangement with the creditor\u2019s collection agent \nand paid the debt off, as shown in documentation from the collection agent. (Applicant \nExhibit N; Tr. 19, 72.) This debt is resolved. \n1.j. Applicant admitted that he owed a past-due debt to a medical provider in the \namount of $100. He reached a payment arrangement with the creditor\u2019s collection agent \nand paid the debt off, as shown in documentation from the collection agent. (Applicant \nExhibit M; Tr. 19, 72.) This debt is resolved. \n1.k. Applicant admitted that he owed a past-due debt to a medical provider in the \namount of $53.

Based on the state of the \nrecord, including Applicant\u2019s successful attempts to resolve other debts, I find that this \ndebt is no longer in existence, (Tr. 19, 72.) \nApplicant\u2019s current financial status is stable. Other than the accounts described \nabove he has no delinquent debt. He is able to pay his current debts without difficulty. \nDepartment Counsel indicated concern over an alleged past-due mortgage loan that \nappeared on Government Exhibit 4. Applicant stated that he was not delinquent on this \nmortgage and that the property had been deeded to his ex-wife. He provided \ndocumentation from the bank stating that Applicant\u2019s loan had been paid in full. (Applicant \nExhibits D and F; Tr. 63-66.) \nMitigation \nApplicant\u2019s manager provided two statements on Applicant\u2019s behalf. In one he \nstates, \u201c[Applicant] helped create and build a unique position in a remote and challenging \nOCONUS location and he performs with skill, knowledge and experience and continually \ncontributes to the mission. . . [Applicant] would be exceptionally difficult to replace.\u201d He \nstrongly recommends Applicant for a position of trust. (Applicant Exhibits B and E.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had ten past-due or charged-off debts, and past-due child support, at the \ntime the SOR was issued. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing \ndisqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation occurred because he had several life-changing \nevents in the 2015-to-2017-time frame that affected his financial well-being. He was \nseverely injured in an industrial accident in 2015. Due to the accident, he spent a \nconsiderable time in the hospital and in rehabilitation. His third wife filed for divorce in \n2017. His period of unemployment, with virtually no income other than workers \ncompensation and a financial recovery, lasted for years. He finally obtained work at an \nOCONUS location right before the COVID pandemic, which affected his life as well. \nOnce Applicant reached a point of financial stability, he began to pay his debts, \nstarting with the smallest. Due to his remote location, he had difficulties contacting \ncreditors and obtaining documentation. However, he submitted sufficient documentation \nto support his written statements and testimony. He has acted responsibly in settling \nthese debts. \nIn reviewing the available evidence, I find that all of the mitigating conditions cited \nhere apply. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nIn support of these findings, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in \ncases such as this is the following: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that \nhe has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is \nthat an applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at a \ntime. (Internal citations and quotation marks omitted.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his past-due indebtedness. Overall, the record evidence does not \ncreate substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

He was unemployed for about nine months after his \ndischarge and has been steadily employed since March 2014. He married in 2005 and is \nseparated from his wife. They have one child. He held a security clearance while in the \nmilitary and has held once continuously since approximately 2015. (Tr. 15-21, 41-42; GE \n1) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in August 2020. In it he \ndisclosed he failed to file his 2015 through 2019 federal income tax returns.

(AE E) \n2020-income tax return filed August 2021 and refund issued. (AE F) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in September 2020. In the \ninterview they discussed his failure to file his federal and state income tax returns from \n2015 through 2019. He told the investigator he did not realize he failed to file his income \ntax returns until he completed his SCA. He misplaced his W-2 forms and was waiting for \nhis former employer to provide them so he could complete the returns. (GE 2) \nApplicant completed government interrogatories in March 2022. He disclosed he \nhad filed his 2018, 2019, and 2020 federal and state tax returns in August 2021. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he procrastinated in filing his federal and state income tax \nreturns. He was always busy and forgot to file, and then he did not realize he had not filed \nhis tax returns until he completed his SCA. He said he had to gather his investment \ndocuments and then he would have complete lapses in focusing on filing the delinquent \nreturns. He would then tell himself he would complete them later and then forgot about \nthem. He admitted he had no excuses for his failure to file his federal and state income \ntax returns. He was aware of his responsibility to file his income tax returns on time. He \nhired an accountant to help him file his delinquent returns. (Tr. 22-23, 35, 51) \nApplicant explained that once he began the process to file the delinquent returns, \nthey were delayed because those returns older that were three years old could not be \nfiled electronically. He credibly testified that he filed his 2017 federal income tax return \nwith the other returns but it has not yet been processed on the IRS website. At the time \nof his hearing, he testified that he did not know if he owed taxes for 2017. (Tr. 23-26, 36-\n40) \nApplicant testified that he filed his state returns when he filed his federal income \ntax returns for 2015 through 2020. He said he received two to three refunds that were \ndeposited into his bank account, but he does not know for what year or if he owed for any \nyears. (Tr. 26-28) \nAt his hearing, Applicant was asked if he had filed his 2021 and 2022 federal and \nstate income tax returns. He testified that he had not yet filed them. He testified that he \nreceived a notice from his accountant prior to the April filing due date reminding him of \nhis obligation to file his income tax returns. He said he saw the email reminder but never \nfollowed up on it. Applicant said that in March 2023 his laptop and hard drive were stolen. \nHe had investment information on it that he needed to file his returns. This would not have \nimpacted his ability to timely file his 2021 federal and state income tax returns. It may \nhave impacted his ability to file his 2022 returns that were due in April.

He was aware of his responsibility to timely file and pay his \ntaxes. (Tr.25, 28-34, 37-39, 43-51) \nApplicant provided a payment activity statement from the IRS dated June 28, 2023. \nIt stated that in January 2023 Applicant made a balance payment of $1,817 for tax year \n2015; for tax year 2017, in August 2022, a balance payment was made of $1,470; and in \nSeptember 2021 for tax year 2018 a balance payment was made of $2,637. (AE G) \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided a document from a tax service showing that he \nwas due refunds for tax years 2021 and 2022 for both federal and state taxes. It appears \nthe tax returns were transmitted and accepted by the IRS on July 18, 2023. It did not \nappear they had been processed yet. (AE H, I) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income taxes as \nrequired.  \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2015 through 2022 federal and state income tax \nreturns. He failed to timely pay his federal taxes for tax year 2018 in the amount of $1,763. \nThere is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying condition. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant provided evidence that he paid his 2018 federal income taxes in 2021. \nHe filed his delinquent 2015-2020 federal income tax returns in August 2021. He credibly \ntestified that he filed his state income tax returns for tax years 2015-2020 at the same \ntime he filed his late federal income tax returns. Post-hearing, it appears he filed his 2021 \nand 2022 federal and state income tax returns in July 2023 and potentially is due refunds. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies. \nAfter completing his SCA in August 2020, discussing his late tax returns with the \ngovernment investigator in September 2020, and completing government interrogatories \nin March 2022, Applicant again failed to timely file his 2021 and 2022 federal and state \nincome tax returns. He also was notified by his accountant that his income tax filings were \ndue. Procrastination, being busy, and then forgetting are not legitimate explanations for \nhis conduct. Applicant\u2019s conduct is frequent, and the evidence supports it may recur. It \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. No evidence was \npresented to show his failing to timely file his tax returns was beyond his control. There \nis no evidence of financial counseling. Applicant paid his 2018 federal tax debt. He \nreceived refunds for some tax years. Despite some mitigation, it is insufficient to mitigate \nApplicant\u2019s continuing conduct and disregard for his legal responsibilities.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that Guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service and participation in combat operations. \nApplicant had not timely filed his federal or state income tax returns from 2015 to 2022. \nDespite being aware of his legal responsibility even after filing the delinquent returns \nalleged in the SOR, he repeated his conduct and failed to timely file for the two most \nrecent years. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board held in ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June 29, \n2016): \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He did not smoke it \nagain until late 2010 or early 2011 when he was drunk at a New Year\u2019s Eve party. He \nheld a security clearance at the time. He tested positive on a test administered by his \nemployer. As discipline, he was suspended for two weeks without pay. (Tr. at 46-50; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE F) \nApplicant credibly testified that he has not knowingly smoked or otherwise \ningested marijuana since the failed drug test in 2011. He tested positive for THC, the \nactive ingredient in marijuana, in a test administered by his employer in April 2020. He \nsmoked cigarettes for years, and for some time before the failed drug test, he used a \nvape pen to inhale the vapor of liquids, primarily with nicotine. He purchased vape liquid \nwithout noticing that it was a cannabidiol or CBD. He lives in a state where marijuana is \nillegal, so he did not expect a legitimate store to sell a product with marijuana or THC. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe used the vape to smoke the CBD product, which must have contained some amount \nof THC, resulting in the positive test. (Tr. at 50-58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE I) \nThe Security Executive Agent for the United States Government provided \nclarifying guidance concerning marijuana on December 21, 2021. Part of that guidance \naddressed CBD products: \nWith respect to the use of CBD products, agencies should be aware that \nusing these cannabis derivatives may be relevant to adjudications in \naccordance with SEAD 4. Although the passage of the Agricultural \nImprovement Act of 2018 excluded hemp from the definition of marijuana \nwithin the Controlled Substances Act, products containing greater than a \n0.3 percent concentration of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a \npsychoactive ingredient in marijuana, do not meet the definition of \u201chemp.\u201d \nAccordingly, products labeled as hemp-derived that contain greater than \n0.3 percent THC continue to meet the legal definition of marijuana, and \ntherefore remain illegal to use under federal law and policy. Additionally, \nagencies should be aware that the Federal Drug Administration does not \ncertify levels of THC in CBD products, so the percentage of THC cannot \nbe guaranteed, thus posing a concern pertaining to the use of a CBD \nproduct under federal law. Studies have shown that some CBD products \nexceed the 0.3 percent THC threshold for hemp, notwithstanding \nadvertising labels (Reference F). Therefore, there is a risk that using these \nproducts may nonetheless cause sufficiently high levels of THC to result in \na positive marijuana test under agency-administered employment or \nrandom drug testing programs. Should an individual test positive, they will \nbe subject to an investigation under specific guidelines established by \ntheir home agency. (GE 5) \nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) \nprovided a warning about CBD products on July 24, 2019: \nStudies have shown that some CBD products\u2019 labeling does not \naccurately reflect their content. Cannabis based products containing a \nTHC level greater than 0.3% on a dry weight basis do not fall under the \nFarm Bill\u2019s definition of hemp even if they are labeled as such. In one \nstudy, the amount of CBD in 69% of the 84 tested CBD products was \ninconsistent with that on the label, and some products contained \nunlabeled cannabinoids, including THC in amounts up to 6.4 mg/mL. As \nsuch, an employee\u2019s drug test may be positive for the THC metabolite, \ndelta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCA), due to THC in the \nCBD product. (GE 6) \nSAMSHA further advised that \u201cfederal agencies should make every effort to \ninform applicants and employees of the risk that using such products may result in a \npositive marijuana test.\u201d (GE 6) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant passed a number of drug tests.

(Tr. at 58-59; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE G, I) \nApplicant called a witness, and he submitted documents and letters attesting to \nhis excellent job performance and strong moral character. He is praised for his work \nethic, reliability, trustworthiness, dependability, honesty, judgment, and integrity. (Tr. at \n60-63; AE D, E) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and two children are citizens and residents of Laos. While his \nchildren have the right to be United States citizens, there is no evidence that he has \never registered them as U.S. citizens. Laos is not an overtly hostile country, but it has a \ncommunist government. The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States. \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution.

Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s family in Laos creates a potential conflict of interest and a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Laos. There is nothing in the \nadministrative notice documents to indicate that Laos is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States or is associated with a substantial risk of terrorism. \nHis fianc\u00e9e and children are not associated with or dependent upon the Laotian \ngovernment. She has run a few small businesses and receives support from Applicant. \nHe is a native-born U.S. citizen. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Laos are outweighed by his deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. It is unlikely he will be placed in a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nposition of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the interests \nof Laos. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are applicable. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana, and he tested positive for THC, the \nactive ingredient in marijuana, in tests administered by his employer. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \n25(b), and 25(c) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant readily admits culpability for the 2011 marijuana use and positive test. \nThat is serious misconduct for someone holding a security clearance, but it was more \nthan 12 years ago. \nThe April 2020 positive test is potentially more concerning, but Applicant\u2019s denial \nof knowingly using marijuana or THC in 2020 was credible, and it is accepted. He \npurchased vape liquid without noticing that it was a cannabidiol or CBD. He lives in a \nstate where marijuana is illegal, so he did not expect a legitimate store to sell a product \nwith marijuana or THC. As addressed in the Government\u2019s documents, CBD products \nare not illegal as long as they do not contain a THC level greater than 0.3%. It is \nextremely unlikely that a store in Applicant\u2019s state would knowingly sell a CBD product \nthat exceeded .3%. \nThe Government\u2019s documents also show that some CBD products\u2019 labeling does \nnot accurately reflect their content, and that the amount of CBD in 69% of the 84 tested \nCBD products was inconsistent with that on the label. As such, a drug test may be \npositive for the THC metabolite due to THC in the CBD product. That is why SAMSHA \nadvised that \u201cfederal agencies should make every effort to inform applicants and \nemployees of the risk that using such products may result in a positive marijuana test.\u201d \nI am not convinced that Applicant knowingly used a controlled substance in 2020. \nThe 2020 conduct is refuted, and the 2011 drug use is mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThe SOR cross-alleged the drug involvement allegations under the personal \nconduct guideline. Applicant possessed and used marijuana, and he tested positive for \nTHC, the active ingredient in marijuana. That conduct reflects questionable judgment \nand an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. The conduct also created \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are \napplicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nThe discussion above under drug involvement is incorporated here. I find the \nconduct is unlikely to recur, and it no longer casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. The above mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B, E, and H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guidelines B, E, and H. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

He is 31 years old, \nunmarried, and he does not have any children. He earned his high school diploma in \n2012. He worked part time for a gas station convenience store from July 2012 to April \n2013 before enlisting in the U.S. Army in April 2013. Beginning in September 2018, he \nworked as an Information Security Service Officer for a DOD subcontractor while on \nterminal leave from the U.S. Army. He was fired from that position in February 2020, as \nfurther discussed below. He has worked for his current employer, another DOD \ncontractor, since a date not in the record. He was first granted a security clearance in \napproximately 2013. (Items 1-4) \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E, and cross alleges under Guideline F, that \nApplicant overstated 52 hours in labor charges amounting to $4,223, while working for a \nDOD subcontractor between December 2019 and February 2020, and his employment \nwas consequently terminated. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a) This allegation is established by a \nFebruary 2020 incident report from the Defense Information System for Security (DISS) \nCase Adjudication Tracking System (CATS) and an April 2020 disclosure report \nsubmitted by the DOD subcontractor to the DOD Office of the Inspector General. (Items \n1, 5-6) \nInternal investigations conducted by both the DOD contractor and subcontractor \nidentified Applicant\u2019s overstated labor charges, as alleged in the SOR. Applicant had no \nprevious issues or infractions. His government branch head reported, however, that he \nhad been coming in late, leaving early, sleeping at work, and delivering poor work. \n(Items 5-6) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s October 2020 background interview, Applicant maintained that \nhe never falsified his timecard. He indicated that he neither attempted to claim extra \ntime nor did he claim time when he was made to stay late to make up for time that he \nwas accused of owing the company for breaks. He described a culture in which his \nthen-supervisor rotated employees\u2019 lunch breaks, timed his lunches and breaks, and \nmade him stay after work to make up for time he took for his breaks. He complied with \nthe internal investigation, and he indicated that he disclosed his termination on his SCA. \nHe also indicated that he did not have any other employment incidents. (Item 4) \nDuring his September 2014 background interview, Applicant indicated that he \nalways followed security procedures. In his Answer, Applicant denied disobeying rules \nor guidelines, and stated that he follows all rules and guidelines of which he is informed. \nHe also denied failing to live within his means, and he stated that he was current on his \ncar loan payments and his mortgage.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n. . . and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \nApplicant overstated 52 hours of labor charges, for a total of $4,223, while \nemployed by a DOD subcontractor from December 2019 through February 2020. \nDespite his denials, the allegation is established by investigative and government \nreports in the record. Further, he was terminated as a result of his actions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(d)(1) and 16(d)(4) apply. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nApplicant had no previous issues or infractions until he overstated labor charges \nwhile employed by a DOD subcontractor from December 2019 through February 2020. \nAlthough he denies doing so, investigations conducted by both the DOD contractor and \nsubcontractor identified his behavior, and he was consequently terminated. An \nemployer\u2019s decisions and characterizations of events are entitled to some deference. \nISCR Case No. 10-03886 at 4 (App Bd. Apr. 26, 2012), cited in ISCR Case No. 09-\n08394 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2013). Applicant failed to take responsibility for his \nconduct in his Answer. As such, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant \u00b6 19(d), \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices \nsuch as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage \nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust.\u201d \nFor the reasons stated above under my Guideline E analysis, I find that AG \u00b6 19(d) \napplies. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \n \n \nFor the reasons stated above under my Guideline E analysis, I find that AG \u00b6 \n20(a) is not established. No other Guideline F mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E and Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the \npersonal conduct and financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Applicant failed to mitigate the potential security concerns raised by his outside \nactivities. Guideline B concerns were mitigated. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 16, 2019. \nOn April 28, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline L and Guideline B. The DoD acted \nunder Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DoD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on May 18, 2022, and requested a \ndecision on the record without a hearing.

Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of \nthe facts contained in the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and \nwill not be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note: \nRepublic of Korea \nThe Republic of South Korea is a stable constitutional democracy, \ngoverned by a president and a unicameral legislature. The country is still \ntechnically at war with North Korea. The armistice has endured since 1953. \nIn the past two decades the number and type of political, economic, and \nsocial interactions between the two Koreas have increased. \nAlthough South Korea has strong bilateral relations with the United \nStates, the country has been involved in multiple incidents of government \nespionage and intelligence collection activities that have resulted in U.S \ncriminal proceedings. South Korea is one of the most active countries \ninvolved in industrial espionage directed at the United States. \nThe South Korean Government generally respects human rights and \nthe rule of law. However, in 2021 there were credible reports of restrictions \non freedom of expression, including criminal libel laws; government \ncorruption; lack of investigation of and accountability for violence against \nwomen; and laws criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual conduct \nbetween adults in the military. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admits all the allegations (SOR \u00b6 1.a and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 1.h) with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant was born in the United States and holds U.S. citizenship by birth. He is \na single 37-year-old contractor.

(Items 3 and 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant worked for [a company (Co2)] from about October 2018 \nuntil at least April 2020. You also realize income through [Korean company], which \nis a local Korean corporation that sponsors you with a visa to reside in South \nKorea. These contemporaneous positions with a U.S. company and a local Korean \ncompany could pose a conflict of interest with your security responsibilities and \ncould create an increased risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified or sensitive \ninformation.  \nAfter recovering from his health issues, Applicant established a new company Co2, \nwhich he registered as limited liability corporation in his home state. He is the sole \nshareholder of Co2. He stated Co2 owns the Korean company in question, and it is as a \nKorean entity that does business in South Korea for Co2. (Item 5 at 4.) He is also the sole \nshareholder and only employee of the Korean corporation in question. (Item 5 at 4.) His \nKorean company sponsors his visa to reside and work in South Korea. (Item 3 at 16.)

He believes the person served all of his obligated \nservice on U.S. military installations in South Korea. \nSOR \u00b6 2.d: Your friend, a citizen of South Korea, served in the South Korea \nmilitary until about May 2016. Applicant admits the allegation and notes all able-bodied \nmales in South Korea are required to perform mandatory military Service. He notes this \nperson is no longer in the South Korean military and ended his military service at the \nabsolute statutory minimum time. \nSOR \u00b6 2.e: You provide approximately $600 yearly financial support to your \nfriend who is a citizen of South Korea. Applicant admits and explains that the individual \nin question is a fellow member of the same faith. While he is working in South Korea he \nallows his friend, who is a student in the United States, to use his car and the friend pays \nfor maintenance while he pays roughly $600 per year for the car insurance. (Item 3 at 34; \nItem 5 at 9.) The support was his attempt to be a good Samaritan and \"paying it forward\" \nfor help he had received in the past during his education. (Answer.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.f: You maintain a bank account in South Korea with an approximate \nvalue of $12,835. Applicant admits he maintains both a personal bank account and a \nbank account for his Korean company, for which he is the only shareholder. He states the \nprimary function of this specified account is to allow him to participate in the Korea \nNational Health insurance. While a resident in South Korea, Applicant pays for national \nhealthcare. (Item 3 at 34.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.g: You maintain a bank account in South Korea with an approximate \nvalue of $620. Applicant admits he maintain both a personal bank and bank account for \nhis Korean company. The primary function of this account is for day to day living \nexpenses. He opened a local bank account for personal use in South Korea in 2018; the \nvalue in the account as of the date of his SCA was $620. (Item 3.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.h: Information as set forth under paragraph 1.a. Applicant admitted \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, which covers his role as sole shareholder of Co2, a U.S. company, and his \nKorean corporation for which he is the sole shareholder. He has no employees besides \nhimself for the Korean corporation. (Item 5.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline L: Outside Activities \nThe security concern for outside activities is set out in AG \u00b6 36: \nInvolvement in certain types of outside employment or activities is of \nsecurity concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual\u2019s security \nresponsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized \ndisclosure of classified or sensitive information. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 37. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any employment or service, whether compensated or volunteer, with: . . . \n(2) any foreign national, organization, or other entity; and \n(3) a representative of any foreign interest. \nApplicant owns and operates the South Korean company in question, which is a \nsubsidiary of his own U.S. company. AG \u00b6 37(a)(2) through 37(a)(3) apply. \nAG \u00b6 38 cites two conditions that could mitigate concerns: \n(a) evaluation of the outside employment or activity by the appropriate \nsecurity or counterintelligence office indicates that it does not pose a conflict \nwith an individual's security responsibilities or with the national security \ninterests of the United States; and \n(b) the individual terminated the employment or discontinued the activity \nupon being notified that it was in conflict with his or her security \nresponsibilities. \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM. As a result there is no evidence in the \nrecord he requested an evaluation of the outside employment or activity by an appropriate \nsecurity or counterintelligence office to show that his South Korean company does not \npose a conflict with his security responsibilities or with the national security interests of \nthe United States or that he terminated the employment or discontinued the activity \npertaining to his company upon being notified that it was in conflict with his security \nresponsibilities. Applicant has not met his burden, AG \u00b6\u00b6 38(a) and 38(b) do not apply. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe concern is set forth in AG \u00b6 6: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(f) ) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nApplicant maintains personal, professional, financial, and various business ties to \nSouth Korea. While there is no evidence of record that intelligence operatives, industrial \nespionage agents, criminals or even terrorists from South Korea seek or have sought \nclassified or economic information from or through Applicant, such attempts cannot be \nruled out pro forma. Before discounting any material risks of foreign influence being \nbrought to bear on Applicant, either directly or indirectly through his South Korean friends \nand businesses, considerations must take account of South Korea's human rights record, \nits intelligence-gathering history, and the nature of the South Korean government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. See ISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 (App. Bd. May 15, \n2018)(citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 March 13, 2017). The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nThe record evidence is sufficient to mitigate the concerns, AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a)-8(c) and 8(f) \napply. The nature of the relationships with his various South Korean friends, as well as \nthe countries where these persons are located, and his activities make it unlikely he will \nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the United States \nand some sort of foreign interest. There is no evidence of a conflict of interest. His South \nKorean company is not doing business with the South Korean defense industry or national \ngovernment. His financial ties are minimal and consistent with what is necessary to do \nbusiness in and reside in South Korea. The nature of his South Korean business and his \nfinancial interests are such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure him. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines L and B in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). The record evidence shows Applicant is the type of individual who \nwould normally pass through the security clearance process without incident. However, \nthe adjudicative guidelines are there for a reason. I am duty bound to follow AG \u00b6 2(b), \nwhich requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant's eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security \nconcerns, but he did not mitigate the outside activities security concerns. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph, Guideline L (Outside Activities): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nCharles C. Hale \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Department Counsel \nsubmitted five additional references requesting administrative notice of the facts recited \nin them (Items 5 \u2013 9) \nThe FORM was mailed to Applicant on October 25, 2022. He was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and to submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. He was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to do so. He received the \nFORM on November 29, 2022. He responded on December 2, 2022. He did not note any \nobjections to the Government\u2019s proposed evidence.

His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 62-year-old contractor. He has been divorced twice, has one adult \nchild, and currently lives with a long-term partner. (Item 3 at 17-19) He earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2004 and his master\u2019s degree in 2014. (Item 3 at 11-12) He has \nbeen employed as a contractor since 1981. (Item 3 at 12-14) He has never served in the \nmilitary.

He did not state whether he had access to classified material at the time he \nwas using and working for a contractor. He stated he stopped in 2013 after his polygraph \nand then resumed use sometime in 2018 when he got a prescription for medical use. He \nstates he consumes it responsibly for anxiety and pain and that he intends to consume \nmarijuana \u201clegally and per the medical prescription.\u201d He stated he did not need to use \nmarijuana and would find alternatives if his continued use would affect his employment. \nHe has not received drug counselling or attended a drug education class. His use is \nevaluated by a physician. (Item 4 at 13) He has never sold it and only purchases small \nquantities for personal use. (Item 4 at A-2) \nApplicant stated he considers \u201cmarijuana an organic, natural herb that helps [him] \nwith anxiety and pain\u201d and that he does not \u201cwant to use synthetic drugs.\u201d He states he \nconsumes marijuana \u201cresponsibly, legally with a prescription and in such a way that does \nnot compromise [his] work performance, ability to keep a secret or to be the target of \nespionage\u2026\u201d He states he would prefer to continue his use of prescription marijuana but \ndoes not wish to \u201cforfeit a clearance over it.\u201d (Item 4 at A-3) \nApplicant responded to the FORM on December 2, 2022, acknowledging \u201cin the \npast that [his] occasional use of marijuana was prohibited under federal law\u201d and states \nhe is contrite about his objectionable behavior. He states he never used marijuana during \nwork hours or came to work under its influence. He argues his use has no bearing on his \njudgement or ability to keep a secret. He requests a favorable clearance determination \nbut notes he does \u201cnot expect a change in disposition to a favorable decision to be cleared \nagain due to [his] continued use of marijuana.\u201d (Answer to FORM) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern regarding drug involvement: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause physical \nor mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n \nApplicant used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency, from  about 1976  to  December \n2020.  He  used marijuana  while  working for defense  contractors. He  stopped  for a period  \nwhile working  for one  defense  contractor until 2010, then  stopped  again  after his  \npolygraph  in 2013. It  appears he  stopped  use  until he  received  a  prescription  for  \nmarijuana  in  2018.  He has continued  to  use  marijuana  and  expressed  his intent to  \ncontinue to do so including after he submitted his May 2021 SCA.\n \n  \nApplicant detailed his marijuana use and intention to continue marijuana use in \nhis May 2021 SCA, his June 2021 interview with a government investigator, his January \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n2022 answer to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories, and his December 2022 response to the \nFORM. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);\n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or\nholding a sensitive position; and\n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse,\nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\nApplicant\u2019s long-term use of marijuana satisfies AG \u00b6 25(a), since the illegal use \nof marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c), constitutes \nsubstance misuse. AG \u00b6 25(g) also applies. The record does not sufficiently establish the \ndisqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 25(f). Though Applicant admits the allegation in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b, the record is unclear as to whether he fully appreciated the distinction between\nholding a clearance and having been granted access to classified material, and whether\nhe admitted that he actually had access to classified material when he answered the\nSOR.\nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nConsidering the evidence, none of the mitigating conditions apply. Marijuana use \nand possession remains prohibited under Federal law. \u201cMedical marijuana has no special \nor preferred status under either the adjudicative guidelines or the new clarifying guidance. \n\u201c[D]isregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not determinative, \nto adjudications of eligibility for access to classified information . . . .\u201d SecEA Clarifying \nGuidance at 2.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-02974 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb 1, 2022). \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant knew that marijuana use was prohibited \nunder Federal law. He used marijuana on and off for over 40 years, continued to purchase \nand use marijuana after applying for a security clearance, and expressed his desire to \ncontinue use. In doing so, he not only knowingly violated Federal drug laws but also \ndisregarded security clearance eligibility standards. This behavior raises substantial \nquestions about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Viewed as a whole, his conduct raises eligibility concerns, such as poor \njudgment, that are broader than his marijuana use. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. I conclude Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the security concerns about his drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, which includes an expressed intent to continue use. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. 2 Background Applicant married in April 2005 and divorced in March 2009. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 34) He remarried in November 2012 and has three children from this marriage (ages eight, six and six). (GEs 1-3; Tr. 86). Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in December 2000. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 29) He reported no military service. Since January 2001, Applicant has been employed by his current defense contractor as an electrical engineer. (GEs 1-3) Previously, he worked for another employer in a technical support position. He has held a security clearance since June 2003. (GEs 1-3) Applicant\u2019s drug history Applicant was introduced to marijuana in college. (GE 8; Tr. 30) He estimates to have used marijuana intermittently between 1997 and 2001. His use of marijuana typically made him \u201cfeel happy and hungry.\u201d (GE 8; Tr. 31-32) Concerned about the potential for testing positive after accepting a position with his current employer, Applicant ceased using marijuana. (GE 8) While on a camping trip in another state in May 1997 with college friends, Applicant\u2019s friends supplied him marijuana, which he used with them on the trip.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 28, 2022, and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on April 6, 2023. A hearing was scheduled for May 15, 2023, \nand heard on the date as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted \nof eight exhibits (GEs 1-8). Applicant relied on three witnesses (including himself) and \neight exhibits (AEs A-H). The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 25, 2023. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with a recap of his marijuana \nhistory. For good cause shown, he was granted 14 days to supplement the record. \nDepartment Counsel was afforded two days to respond. Within the time permitted, \nApplicant supplemented the record with a recap of his marijuana activity. Applicant\u2019s \nsubmission was admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s AE I. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly used marijuana over a period of years. \nMore specifically, he allegedly (a) used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nSeptember 2018 to about September 2020 and (b) used and purchased marijuana from \nabout September 2008 to about October 2009. And. he allegedly (c) used marijuana \nwith varying frequency from about September 2018 to about September 2020, while \ngranted a security clearance and (d) used and purchased marijuana with varying \nfrequency, from about September 2008 to about October 2009, while granted a security \nclearance; and (e) used and purchased marijuana with varying frequency from about \nJanuary 1996 to about October 2020. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations \npertaining to prior marijuana use and purchases with explanations. He claimed the use \nof the term \u201cwith varying frequency\u201d in the SOR, because he only used marijuana on \nthree occasions between September 2018 and September 2020: twice in 2018 and \nonce in 2020 while on camping trips with his cousin in the mountains of a neighboring \nstate. He also claimed his use of marijuana in 2018-2020 was extenuated by the \nstressful circumstances he was experiencing with his work. Addressing his 2008-2009 \nuse of marijuana, Applicant claimed he possessed a small amount of marijuana during \nthe 2008-2009 time-frame and used the drug with his cousin on a few occasions. He \nclaimed to have used the marijuana to relieve his stress and anxiety from an ongoing \ndivorce without considering the consequences of his actions. He further claimed that he \nno longer possesses or controls any drugs or paraphernalia. And, he claimed that peer \npressure played a major role in his use of marijuana in college. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant and \nmaterial findings.

(GEs 1-3; Tr. 34) He \nremarried in November 2012 and has three children from this marriage (ages eight, six \nand six). (GEs 1-3; Tr. 86). Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical \nengineering in December 2000. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 29) He reported no military service. \nSince January 2001, Applicant has been employed by his current defense \ncontractor as an electrical engineer. (GEs 1-3) Previously, he worked for another \nemployer in a technical support position. He has held a security clearance since June \n2003. (GEs 1-3) \nApplicant\u2019s drug history \nApplicant was introduced to marijuana in college. (GE 8; Tr. 30) He estimates to \nhave used marijuana intermittently between 1997 and 2001. His use of marijuana \ntypically made him \u201cfeel happy and hungry.\u201d (GE 8; Tr. 31-32) Concerned about the \npotential for testing positive after accepting a position with his current employer, \nApplicant ceased using marijuana. (GE 8) \nWhile on a camping trip in another state in May 1997 with college friends,\nApplicant\u2019s friends supplied him marijuana, which he used with them on the trip. (GE 8) \nTypically, he paid approximately $15.00 for \u201cone hit,\u201d which he placed in his mouth. (GE \n8) When interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) in May 2003, he told the investigator that he no longer associates with anyone \nwho uses drugs and has no \u201cfuture intentions of using any illegal substance.\u201d (GE 8)  \nFor reasons, he cited his concerns over succumbing to irresponsible behavior that could \nexpose him to risks of losing his job. (GE 8) \n \nBetween 2001 and 2008, Applicant avoided illegal drugs and persons who used \nthem (inclusive of marijuana) altogether. (GE 7) In September 2008, Applicant resumed \nhis use of marijuana, in this case on a camping trip with his cousin in a neighboring \nstate that at the time legalized the use of the substance for medicinal purposes. (GE 7; \nTr. 33-34) Going through a divorce at the time, Applicant was burdened with stress and \nanxiety and did not consider the consequences of his actions. (GEs 2-3 and 7) He \nretained a small amount of marijuana for a little over a year and \u201csmoked it 1-2 times \nper month during that duration.\u201d (GE 2) \nThereafter, Applicant abstained from marijuana use for over 10 years before \nresuming his use of the drug in September 2018. (GE 6; Tr. 40-41) While under work-\nrelated stress and anxiety, Applicant resumed his use of marijuana with his same cousin \nbetween 2018 and 2020: twice in 2018 and once in 2020 (GE 6; Tr. 41-42) Applicant \nhas never been physically addicted to marijuana and is fully familiar with federal laws \nthat ban the use of marijuana. With a better understanding of symptoms of stress and \nanxiety through his consultations with his engaged therapist, he assured that he is \ncurrently better situated to deal with these symptoms with developed coping \nmechanisms and avoid marijuana when navigating future stress situations.

(AEs A and \nE; Tr. 57-60) \nApplicant\u2019s submissions include a signed, sworn statement, pledging to remain \nfree from all drugs, including marijuana, and refrain from any and all substance abuse. \n(AE A) In his statement, he fully acknowledged that any future involvement with drugs or \nmisuse of the same will be grounds for revocation of his security clearance and any \nnational security eligibility. (AE A; Tr. 83) \nApplicant\u2019s 2023 pledge to refrain from illegal drug use (inclusive of marijuana), \nwhile encouraging, is not the first time he has pledged to refrain from possessing and \nusing illegal drugs (both explicitly and implicitly). He made a similar pledge to avoid any \nfuture use of marijuana in an OPM interview in 2003. (GE 8) \nFurther, in an e-QIP Applicant completed in March 2010, he acknowledged his \npurchase and use of marijuana one to two times a month between 2008 and 2009 \nduring a difficult time for him and assured he no longer possessed or controlled illegal \ndrugs. (GE 3) In a follow-up interview with an OPM investigator in May 2010, he \nacknowledged again his purchase and use of marijuana in 2008-2009, and assured he \nwas no longer in possession or control of illegal drugs and stopped \u201ccold turkey\u201d using \nillegal drugs in October 2009. (GE 7) \nIn his own statement, Applicant traced his growth in a rural farming community to \nhis college schooling, and to his post-college acceptance of a position with his current \nemployer. (AE E) He described his current marriage and separation and joint \ncommitments to their \u201ckids\u2019 lives and activities,\u201d while looking for ways to reconcile their \nrelationship. (AE E) Applicant detailed the active hobbies of his children and himself. \nHistorically, he has enjoyed many hobbies (inclusive of computers and technology, \nwoodworking, gardening, cooking, camping/outdoors, hunting, auto repair and \nrestoration, and motorcycles). (AE E) He cited to a strong family military heritage and \nhis own unique skills and capabilities that have enabled him to design and build \ncomputing and processing systems for future military fighting platforms. (AE E) For all \nof his contributions to the U.S. fighting force, he remains \u201cvery proud.\u201d (AE E) \nWith his wealth of experience in the defense industry and more recent 2023 \npledge to avoid all illegal drugs (inclusive of marijuana) in the future, Applicant is entitled \nto considerable credit. His recent pledge of sustained abstinence is encouraging and \nworthy of acceptance as a sincere reflection of his current thinking. Because of his \nfailures in keeping similar pledges in the past, assigning weight to his latest pledge of \nabstinence will require adjusting to account for his failed prior pledges of future \nabstinence. Based on Applicant\u2019s historical accounts of his marijuana use and repeated \nfailed assurances to abstain, additional corroborating proofs (inclusive of an \nassessment from a licensed substance abuse counselor) are needed to fully validate his \nmost recent pledge of sustained future abstinence. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEndorsements and performance evaluations \nAlthough currently separated from his wife, he and his spouse are working \nseriously to reconcile.

The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nDrug Involvement \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic \nterm adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed \nabove. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation.

The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan v.

Applicant\u2019s recurrent involvement with illegal drugs invite concerns \nover whether his actions reflect pattern marijuana use that are incompatible with the \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness requirements for gaining access to classified \ninformation. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to using marijuana raise security concerns over risks of \nrecurrence as well as judgment issues. On the strength of the evidence presented, \nthree disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for drug involvement apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201dany substance misuse\u201d; 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled \nsubstance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of Illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia\u201d; and 25(f), \u201cany illegal \ndrug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \nTo his credit, Applicant pledged anew to abandoning all involvement with \nmarijuana. And, for almost three years, he has remained abstinent from illegal drugs \n(inclusive of marijuana). Currently, he exhibits no visible signs or indications of \nsuccumbing to any risks or pressures he might encounter to return to illegal drug use in \nthe foreseeable future. However, his most recent pledge to avoid illegal drugs is not the \nfirst time he has offered assurances of his intentions to avoid involvement in illegal \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ndrugs (inclusive of marijuana) in the future. On three separate occasions, he made \nsimilar pledges, only to return to marijuana use to deal with recurrent issues of stress \nand anxiety. \nKeeping promises is a fundament of the trust relationship an applicant enters into \nwith the Government once he is granted access to classified information. See Snepp v. \nUnited States, 444 U.S. 507, 510-511n.6 (1980) Trust relationships involve reciprocal \npromises and commitments between the parties. Promises by the Government to grant \naccess to classified information require reciprocal promises and commitments by the \napproved applicant to adhere to federal laws, regulations, and policy guidelines \nimposed on the applicant\u2019s holding a security clearance. Put differently, promises made \nby an applicant in a trust relationship with the Government are promises that need to be \nkept for the duration of his trust relationship. By failing to keep his promises and \ncommitments to avoid activities involving illegal drugs, Applicant breached his trust \nagreement with the Government in a material way \nTo be sure, Applicant has exhibited candor throughout the investigation process \nand warrants credit with being upfront with Government investigators. Still, his material \nbreaches of the promises he previously made to avoid all future involvement with illegal \ndrugs require accountability and adjustments in the time lines potentially available to \napplicants without security clearances who hypothetically seek mitigation of prior \ninstances of illegal drug use. With the persuasive burden of proof firmly fixed on \nApplicant to dispel all doubts about any risks of recurrence, Applicant\u2019s evidentiary \nburden is considerable. And, final decisions require definitive assessments without any \nallowances for conditional decisions. Egan teaches that where doubts exist about an \napplicant\u2019s recurrence risks when considered contextually with unfulfilled past \nabstention promises, doubts must be resolved in the Government\u2019s favor. See Egan v. \nthe Department of the Navy, supra, at 531. \nWhat might under other circumstances warrant successful mitigation with almost \nthree years of sustained abstinence will require additional years of seasoning on \nApplicant\u2019s part to restore the trust levels required to access classified information. So, \nwhile Applicant is entitled to credit for his exhibited candor about his past involvement \nwith marijuana in his e-QIPs and personal subject interviews, more time is needed here \nto re-establish the trust levels required for continued eligibility to hold a security \nclearance. \nOverall, while Applicant has shown marked improvement in his judgment and \nmaturity level in the almost three years he has avoided marijuana use, it is too soon to \ncredit him with full mitigation of his past involvement with illegal drugs (marijuana) while \nholding a security clearance. Without additional proven time in sustained abstinence, \napplication of mitigating conditions (MCs) of the drug involvement guideline: MC \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d; and 26(b), \u201cthe \nindividual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides \nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n       \n      \n \n \n   \n                             \n \n \n                \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nabstinence, including, but not limited to \n. \n. \n. \n, (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used . . , \u201d is very limited. \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has not established enough \nindependent probative evidence of his overall honesty, trustworthiness, maturity and \ngood judgment required of those who seek eligibility to hold a security clearance or \nsensitive position. Because of his past unfilled promises to refrain from future illegal \ndrugs (inclusive of marijuana), more time in sustained abstinence is needed to restore \nthe trust levels required for continued eligibility to hold a security clearance. \nConsidering the record as a whole at this time, inclusive of the credits Applicant \nis entitled to in recognition of his contributions to the defense industry, there is \ninsufficient probative evidence of sustainable mitigation in the record to make safe \npredictable judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to avoid illegal drugs in the foreseeable \nfuture. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s \nrecurrent drug activities over a 13-year period while holding a security clearance, \nApplicant has not mitigated security concerns with respect to the allegations covered by \nSOR \u00b6\u00b61.a through 1.e. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 25 years old. He is not married and has no children. In 2015, he \nreceived two high school graduation diplomas. One was from his mainstream high school \nand another from a high school that specialized in math and science. He graduated from \ncollege in 2019 and then began work for his present employer, a federal contractor. (Tr. \n18-19, 21-22; AE E, F) \nApplicant testified that looking back on 2015, he now believes he was having \nmental health issues, but did not know it at the time. He believed he was on the spectrum \nfor autism and also had attention deficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but no one \nbelieved him because it was thought that these two mental health issues contradicted \neach other. He testified that after he graduated from high school and began his first year \nof college, he continued to have issues with autism, ADHD, and he began experiencing \ndepression. He chose the specific college he attended because it had the major he \nwanted, which was a specialized and highly challenging curriculum. He did well his \nfreshman and sophomore year. (Tr. 19-21) \nIn late 2017, Applicant\u2019s junior year of college, the curriculum became very \ndemanding, and he began having mental health issues due to stress and lack of sleep. \nHe reached out for help. He went to his college\u2019s health services and was told because \nhe had medical insurance through his parents, he needed to seek private health services. \nHe spent months trying to find medical care from a provider that accepted his parents\u2019 \nout-of-state insurance. He was on waiting lists for different psychiatric providers. (Tr. 24-\n25, 30, 32-34) \nApplicant\u2019s medical records reflect that sometime in 2018, his friends at school \ntook him to a hospital emergency room because they were concerned about his mental \nhealth. They convinced his parents that he needed treatment and should receive it close \nto his home. In May 2018, due to the stresses from school, Applicant self-referred and \nwas hospitalized for ten days. He said he was told by the doctor that they could only \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndiagnose surface-level issues and not the underlying problems or causes. (Tr. 24-25, 30, \n32-34) \nApplicant admitted that on three occasions he had attempted suicide and a fourth \ntime he had a suicide ideation. His first attempt was while in high school and then in 2017 \nand 2018. He explained that on the outside he appeared to be fine, but what was going \non inside of him was not always apparent. These issues became more pronounced when \nexternal symptoms began to manifest. (Tr. 24-25, 30, 32-34) \nHospital records reflect Applicant was not having current homicidal ideations at \nthat time. He testified that he never had homicidal ideations, but he admits that he has \ndifficulty recalling this period of his hospitalization as that time remains foggy to him. He \ncredibly testified that he does not deny that he reported homicidal ideations at the time, \nbut he just could not recall it. He did not believe his ideation was homicidal but did believe \nhis ideation was violent. His hospital records reflect he did have an episode of homicidal \nideation, which involved holding someone against their will so they could watch him \ncommit suicide. (Tr. 27-29, 35, 63-69; GE 4). \nApplicant was prescribed medication, released from the hospital, and transitioned \nto an outpatient psychiatric clinic. His discharge diagnosis was major depressive disorder \nrecurrent severe with psychotic symptoms. During his outpatient follow-up treatment, he \nwent through a full-scale psychiatric evaluation with a behavioral therapist and follow-up \nappointments. He began seeing a psychiatrist at a psychiatric clinic who then left the \npractice, and his new practice did not take Applicant\u2019s insurance. He was diagnosed with \ndepression, social anxiety, panic attacks, autism and ADHD. At this point, he began being \ntreated for ADHD and depression. He then transitioned as a patient to Dr. Z in 2021. Dr. \nZ prescribed medication to help Applicant\u2019s mental health issues. Applicant has been \ncompliant. He provided medical records that show since he has been seeing Dr. Z, his \nsymptoms have stabilized. The medical records also show a progression of improvement \nand compliance with medication management. (Tr.25-28, 31, 35-39, 81-83; AE P, Q, R) \nDr. Z\u2019s assessment in April 2021 was major depressive disorder recurrent without \npsychotic features, social anxiety disorder, panic attacks, ADHD combined type, history \nof mild autism. Medical records show that Applicant consistently followed up with regular \nappointments with Dr. Z throughout 2021 and 2022. Dr. Z\u2019s March 2022 report shows the \nsame diagnostic assessment as the initial one. It also noted that Applicant\u2019s depression \nwas improving, and they discussed coping skills and acknowledging limitations. His notes \nstated that he educates Applicant about the nature of his illness, symptoms, course of \nillness and ways to treat and also deal with unwanted consequences of the illness on his \nrelationships, at work and other functional abilities. Dr. Z\u2019s supportive therapy focused on \nimproving self-esteem, ameliorating symptoms, and maximizing Applicant\u2019s adaptive \ncapabilities by encouragement, education, guidance, and reassurance. They also \nexamined the nature of relationships and emotional responses or behaviors to make \nApplicant more aware. Applicant\u2019s progress towards his goals were good. Dr. Z\u2019s last \nreport from September 2022 provides the same assessment and that Applicant has been \ncompliant with his medication management.

How often Applicant sees Dr. \nZ is dependent on his medical opinion and indications from Applicant about his mental \nhealth. (Tr. 38-41, 81-83; AE P, Q, R) \nApplicant testified that Mr. K is his therapist. Mr. K testified he has been a licensed \nprofessional counselor since 2003. Applicant began seeing Mr. K in late 2017, and he \nhad weekly appointments. He continued into 2018 and towards the end he saw him every \nother week until late 2019 when he saw him monthly. In 2020, due to the pandemic the \nappointments were virtual, and he saw him five times. In 2021 he saw him four times. He \nsaw him twice in 2022, the last time in March. Their sessions are usually an hour long. \nThey would discuss any problems Applicant was experiencing and potential solutions. \nMr. K diagnosed Applicant with major depression, moderate, anxiety disorder, and panic \ndisorder. He is not aware of a present psychotic diagnosis but was aware of a diagnosis \nin 2018. (Tr. 30-34, 41-43, 71-73, 106-123) \nDuring their last meeting in March 2022, Mr. K and Applicant jointly decided they \nwould meet on an as needed basis. Applicant had no major stressor at that time and Mr. \nK told him that he is welcome to reach out if he needed anything. This was left up to \nApplicant. At their last appointment, Applicant was managing fine and there were no \ndepression symptoms. Mr. K does not prescribe medication. He remains Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent therapist. (Tr. 41-43, 106-123) \nApplicant testified that he believes his original diagnosis that included \u201cwith \npsychosis\u201d was because his ADHD was manifesting him being fixated on something, \nwhich is also a symptom of ADHD. (Tr. 58-59) \nIn November 2021, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. B, a licensed psychologist \napproved by DOD. She diagnosed him with major depressive disorder (recurrent, severe), \npanic disorder without agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and schizoid \npersonality traits. She indicated his prognosis was guarded and concluded his reliability, \njudgment, stability, and trustworthiness are in question. She reported that he had only \nundergone sporadic counseling since his 2018 hospitalization. He required numerous \nalterations in medications due to poor management of symptoms. He had limited social \nsupport and his treatment history was far from appropriate to manage his conditions. She \nopined that his psychological tests suggest that he is not willing to make a commitment \nto therapy and that he either lacked insight into his past or was unwilling to acknowledge \nit, which led her to her poor prognosis. (GE 2) \nDr. B reported she contacted Mr. K. She reported that Applicant saw Mr. K monthly \nin 2018 and 2019, but only twice in 2020 and 2021. This is inconsistent with both Mr. K\u2019s \ntestimony and Applicant\u2019s as noted above. Mr. K opined that he had no concerns \nregarding Applicant from a security perspective, so long as he remained in treatment.

(GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he was evaluated through a Zoom meeting with Dr. B. They \ntalked for less than an hour and then there was an hour of questions, which he said were \nfocused on him being schizophrenic. He credibly testified that she was aggressive \ntowards him, so he kept his distance because he does not like being yelled at. He \ncontacted both Dr. Z and Mr. K. to advise them Dr. B would be contacting them. Applicant \ntestified that Dr. Z told him that Dr. B never provided the appropriate documentation \nrequired by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) to release \ninformation. Applicant stated he did not oppose Dr. B having access to his psychiatric \nrecords from Dr. Z. He personally contacted Dr. B after his evaluation because he wanted \nto make sure she contacted Dr. Z. She told him she was working on it. Applicant testified \nDr. B was hostile towards him for contacting her about ensuring she contacted Dr. Z. He \nstated when he received Dr. B\u2019s report, he analyzed it and concluded her facts \u201cwere so \nfar distant from everything.\u201d (Tr. 45-48) \nApplicant credibly testified that he would continue to be compliant with Dr. Z\u2019s \nrecommendations and medicine management. He does not want to go back to his \nprevious mental health issues. He likes being a proper functioning member of society. He \ncontinues to see Dr. Z every one to three months as needed. He sees Dr. Z for medication \nmanagement and any side effects. He sees Mr. K for therapy and counseling as needed. \nHe has learned to manage stress through different practices and coping skills. He has \nalso learned to channel his stress into being more productive at work. He has discussed \nthis with Mr. K. He does not have any stressor related to his mental health at work or with \nhis supervisors or coworkers or outside of work. He lives alone but got a rescue dog about \na year ago. He feels he is in a stable environment. He has a strong support system, which \nincludes his parents, friends, and former and present coworkers. He stated, \u201cI\u2019m just trying \nto live my life with this mental health issue and go on existing and do the best I can.\u201d (Tr. \n48-49, 51-52, 83-87) \nApplicant\u2019s mother testified on his behalf. She stated that she always believed that \nhe was on the autism spectrum, but he did not necessarily fit the criterion. She also \nbelieved before he was diagnosed that he had ADHD, but he was able to mask it because \nhe was a good student and also was an Eagle Scout. She described 2018 as a difficult \nyear because it was his junior year, which is a demanding curriculum for engineering \nmajors. Another factor was that his grandfather passed away. She was concerned \nApplicant was depressed. She went to his school to check on him and observed a major \npanic attack. She said it was very difficult to get him mental health treatment because \ntheir insurance was out-of-state, and they did not have a diagnosis at the time. They could \nnot get an appointment for weeks. She is much more aware of what signs to look for now. \n(Tr. 88-105) \nApplicant\u2019s mother noted he is now more communicative and is very protective of \nhis mental health.

He has known Applicant \nfor about five or six years and in the past three years has been his direct supervisor. He \nis aware of the security concerns that were raised, including the suicide attempts and \nhomicide ideation. He is aware of some of Applicant\u2019s nervous habits associated with his \nautism and has helped him to develop better social skills.

He believes Applicant would act responsibly in handling classified information. \n(Tr. 124-132) \nMr. L has had a security clearance for 40 years. He works with Applicant and has \ndaily interaction. He believes that most engineers have a certain personality type and that \nsome of their social skills are impacted by their analytical and technical skills. He has \nreviewed the SOR and has not seen any conduct by Applicant that would cause him to \nbe concerned about protecting classified information. (Tr. 133-138) \nMr. T testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He is responsible for DOD contracts for his \ncompany. He has held a security clearance since 1986. He has frequent contact with \nApplicant and described him as a great employee. He assesses him as extremely \nintelligent, bright, diligent and a positive impact on their program. Applicant has been open \nand honest with him about his past suicide attempts and managing his current condition. \nHe is receptive to being mentored by Mr. T both professionally and socially. Mr. T has no \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s ability to responsibly handle classified information. He \ndescribed Applicant as a rule follower. (Tr. 139-144) \nMr. A testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He has held a security clearance since 2006. \nHe and Applicant previously worked together, do not anymore, but remain friends. He is \naware of the government\u2019s security concerns. He described Applicant as brilliant. He said \nApplicant self-reported that he was receiving mental health treatment. He stated that \nApplicant has a solid group of friends who he can talk to and if he has any concerns, they \nwill help him address them.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow prescribed treatment plans related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication, or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nSometime in 2018, Applicant was brought to the emergency room by his college \nroommates who were concerned about his mental health. In May 2018, he self-referred \nand was voluntarily admitted for inpatient hospitalization and treatment. From sometime \nin high school until approximately May 2018, he had four suicide attempts or ideations. A \ngovernment-approved psychologist opined that Applicant has a condition that may impair \nhis judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 20(b) and 20(c) apply. \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant had a prescribed treatment plan that \nhe failed to follow. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \nApplicant recognized he had mental health issues and initially had difficulty getting\ntreatment. He self-referred for inpatient hospitalization in 2018. He has been actively \ninvolved in therapy with Mr. K since late 2017. He saw him regularly but is now at the \npoint where they agree to meet on an as needed basis. After his hospitalization, he began \ntreatment with a psychiatrist and then transitioned to Dr. Z who is also a psychiatrist. Dr. \nZ has prescribed medication for Applicant, and he also sees him regularly for medicine \nmanagement and support. All indications are that Applicant is compliant. Since April 2021 \nDr. Z has consistently diagnosed Applicant with major depressive disorder recurrent \nwithout psychotic features, social anxiety disorder, panic attacks, ADHD combined type, \nhistory of mild autism.  \n \nI have considered Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis. Mr. K has been Applicant\u2019s therapist since \nearly 2018. Dr. Z has been treating Applicant since April 2021. I also considered some of \nthe inconsistencies in Dr. B\u2019s report. I have concerns that she is the only professional that \ndiagnosed Applicant with schizoid personality traits, a serious diagnosis that is based on \na Zoom evaluation without consultation with his treating psychiatrist. I find Applicant\u2019s \ntreating therapist and psychiatrist\u2019s diagnoses and opinions are more probative based \nupon their more frequent and detailed interactions with him. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant\u2019s conditions are being controlled with \ntreatment and he has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \nrecommendations by his therapist and psychiatrist. AG \u00b6 29(a) applies. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant voluntarily sought mental health treatment \nand counseling. Mr. K and Dr. Z are part of his ongoing treatment.

He is managing \nhis anxiety through different strategies and medication. He has been fully compliant with \ntaking his prescribed medication as well as maintaining regular follow-up appointments. \nThe evidence supports that although Applicant does have mental health \nconditions, they are being controlled with treatment, and Applicant has been consistently \ncompliant with his treatment plan. He sees his mental health professionals regularly and \non an as needed basis. He excels at work and is highly regarded as a professional. I find \nAG \u00b6 20(e) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline I in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s commitment to ensuring his mental health is a priority is evident in his \nconsistent awareness and compliance with his medicine management and therapy. He \nhas met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me without questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline I, \npsychological conditions. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

He has worked for defense contractors since 1995. He \nreceived his bachelor\u2019s of science in 1988. From 1989 until 1995, he served honorably \non active duty in the U.S. Navy, where he held a security clearance. He married in 1989 \nand separated in 1995. He is uncertain if his divorce was ever finalized, however, his wife \nhas since died. He has an adult stepdaughter. (GX 1; Tr. 40.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file and pay his \n2015 and 2016 Federal and state taxes and that the filings and taxes remained \noutstanding. The SOR also alleges 11 delinquent accounts totaling $58,249. The debts \nare comprised of credit-card accounts and utilities accounts. The SOR further alleges that \nthe property associated with Applicant\u2019s first and second mortgage loans was foreclosed \ndue to Applicant\u2019s inability to make his mortgage-loan payments. Applicant admits each \nof the debts with an explanation for why the debts were incurred. \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleges under that Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in 1987, 1988, 1984, and twice \nin 2019. Applicant admits each of the arrests and charges with an explanation of the \ncircumstances and outcome of each event. The DUI arrests are cross-alleged under \nGuideline J. \nThe delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) from \nJanuary 2019 and December 2016, and discussed in his January 2018 personal subject \ninterview (PSI). (GX 4; GX 3; GX 2.) \nFinancial Background \nSince starting work as a defense contractor in 1997, Applicant had a history of \nfinancial stability. He lived within his means, stayed current on his ongoing financial \nobligations, and regularly contributed to his 401(k). He purchased his house in 2000 and \nmaintained his mortgage-loan payments. In 2005, Applicant took out a second mortgage-\nloan on his home and maintained the payments. After 17 years of employment with the \nsame defense contractor, Applicant was a project manager earning approximately \n$125,000 a year. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant and his former girlfriend began dating in approximately 2005, and at \nsome point she moved into Applicant\u2019s house. She was employed and contributed to the \nhousehold expenses. Applicant leased a car for her to use in 2011. (Tr. 67; GX 6.) \n \nIn January 2014, Applicant was laid off from his job when his employer\u2019s largest \nGovernment contract ended. Despite his efforts to gain work as a defense contractor, he \nwas unable to do so. From January 2014 until December 2016, Applicant was self-\nemployed as a consultant working for his former employer. While he was not earning as \nmuch as he had been, with his income, his savings, and later, several withdrawals from \nhis 401(k), he was able to meet most of his financial obligations. He also used his credit-\ncard accounts for living expenses. Applicant prioritized paying his mortgage-loan and \nvehicle-loan payments. He wanted to keep his house of 14 years and he needed his 2012 \nvehicle to go to job interviews and to work. (Tr. 24-25; Tr. 37; Tr. 55-56.) \nNot long after Applicant was laid off, his former girlfriend ended the relationship \nand moved out. This increased Applicant\u2019s financial strain. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s former\ngirlfriend had agreed to maintain the payments on the automobile lease that Applicant\nhad secured in his name. She defaulted on the lease and created additional financial\ndifficulties for Applicant. (Tr. 24-25; Tr. 67.) \n \n \n \nIn approximately 2015, Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter was employed at a bar and grill \nthat went on the market for sale. She wanted to purchase the establishment but did not \nhave the financial resources to do so, and asked Applicant to help with the purchase. \nAlthough Applicant had made some withdrawals for his own financial obligations, his \n401(k) was still strong. He decided to make a withdrawal from his self-directed 401(k) to \npurchase the business with the agreement from his stepdaughter that she would manage \nit. Because he used existing financial resources, the investment did not have an \nimmediate impact on Applicant\u2019s day-to-day finances. Within about a year, Applicant\u2019s \nstepdaughter lost interest in managing the business and sought other employment. \nApplicant lived an hour from the business, was not personally interested in running it, and \nwas also busy with his consulting work. He sold the business in 2016 for less than he paid \nfor it, and he estimates his total loss on investment was approximately $20,000. (Tr. 42-\n44.) \nApplicant\u2019s consulting contract ended in December 2016 and he was unemployed \nfrom January 2017 until November 2017. It was during this period of unemployment that \nhe began to default on his financial obligations. Applicant\u2019s seven credit-card debts, \ntotaling $50,152 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c through 3.h and 3.m) dates of last activity were between \nAugust 2016 in October 2016 and the dates of first major delinquency are between March \n2017 and November 2017. (GX 6; GX 7; GX 8.) \nIn approximately May 2017, Applicant was no longer able to maintain his \nmortgage-loan payments and he defaulted on both the first and second mortgage loans. \nIn November 2017, Applicant started working at a shipping and receiving company as a \ntruck loader and driver\u2019s helper. The work was seasonal, and Applicant frequently worked \n16-hour days in an effort to earn enough money for his minimal living expenses.

His step-daughter rented a small \ntrailer and Applicant rented a room from her. (Tr. 37; Tr. 61-68; GX 6; Tr. 25.)  \nIn June 2018, Applicant\u2019s former supervisor from his defense contracting job, who \nwas then employed as a supervisor at a small defense contractor, contacted Applicant \nabout an employment opportunity. Applicant accepted the position and is currently \nworking as an IT system administrator earning approximately $90,000 per year. \nApplicant\u2019s daughter got married and moved, and Applicant remained living in the trailer \nbecause of the low expense. He continued to drive his 2012 vehicle, which he paid off in \nFebruary 2020, until September 2020 when the vehicle reached a stage where it needed \nrepairs that were greater than its value. He purchased a 2016 vehicle in September 2020 \nfor necessary transportation to and from work. He has worked to maintain overall low \nliving expenses. (Tr. 24-26; GX 8.) \nApplicant is current on all his ongoing financial obligations, has not incurred any \nrecent delinquent debts, and has a net monthly remainder. In November 2020, Applicant \nenrolled in a credit monitoring program with the major credit reporting agency. As of \nOctober 2022, his credit score has improved by 29 points. (Tr. 32; Tr. 60-61; GX 8, GX \n7.) \nFederal and State Taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3a. and 3.b) \nWhile working as a consultant between 2014 and 2016, Applicant did not \nunderstand that he was required to pay his Federal taxes quarterly. It had been \nApplicant\u2019s practice to file his own tax returns using tax preparation software. For tax year \n2015, he used a free online tax preparation calculator at a major tax preparation \ncompany\u2019s website. He entered his income from his consulting contract and calculated \nthat his income did not require him to file a Federal tax return or to pay any taxes. It did \nnot alert him to the requirement of paying quarterly taxes. Additionally, Applicant failed to \nenter the income from his 401(k) withdrawals, including the withdrawal to invest in the bar \nand grill, or from the income generated by the bar and grill 2015 until 2016. He did not file \na Federal tax return for 2015 nor did he pay any Federal or state taxes. Applicant used \nthe same online calculator for tax year 2016 and, again, did not file a Federal or state tax \nreturn and did not pay any taxes. (Tr. 44-52.) \nApplicant was unemployed for the first four months of 2017 and did not earn \nenough income to be required to file a Federal tax return. At some point between 2017 in \n2018, Applicant received a notice from the IRS that stated that the IRS would file \nsubstitute returns for Applicant for tax years 2015 and 2016. The notice listed Applicant\u2019s \nincome for those two tax years and a total amount due for unpaid taxes, penalties, and \ninterest in the approximate amount of $16,000. The notice stated that Applicant could \naccept the amount due and proceed to a repayment plan or he could object and a different \nprocess would occur. Applicant was aware of the heightened security concerns regarding \ndelinquent taxes. He accepted the amount due and agreed to pay it.

Additionally, the IRS withheld Applicant\u2019s refunds for tax years 2018 \nthrough 2021. In May 2022, Applicant made his final payment to the IRS for his delinquent \ntaxes in the approximate amount of $1,200. (Tr. 26; Tr. 43; Tr. 54; Tr. 72.) \nAt some point between 2018 and 2020, Applicant learned that he also owed \ndelinquent state income taxes in the amount of $15,489. Beginning in September 2020, \nthe state Department of Revenue garnished Applicant\u2019s pay in the amount of $927 a \nmonth and withheld his tax refunds for 2019 and 2020. The garnishment was completed \nin April 2021 and Applicant received a state tax refund in the amount of $334 for tax year \n2021. Applicant timely paid his income taxes and filed his returns every year he was \nemployed until 2015. Since 2018, Applicant has resumed doing so. (Tr. 45; Tr. 49-54; AX \nB.) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b have been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c through 3.o \nApplicant was able to live within his means and not incur any additional delinquent \ndebt while paying his tax debts. He did not want to overextend his finances by entering \ninto repayment agreements with his other creditors while his tax debts were resolved. \nAfter Applicant satisfied his Federal and state tax debts, he contacted a financial \ncounselor to help him address his other outstanding debts. In approximately June 2022, \nApplicant met with the financial counselor and provided him with financial documents \nincluding copies of the CBR\u2019s sent to Applicant by Department Counsel. The financial \ncounselor told Applicant that he would review the financial documents and come up with \na plan for satisfying the outstanding debts. (Tr. 70-73.) \nHowever, the financial counselor Applicant intended to hire did not satisfactorily \nprovide a plan to Applicant in a timely manner. After conducting some research, Applicant \nsigned an agreement with a debt-relief agency and enrolled in a debt-resolution program. \nUnder the terms of the agreement, Applicant will pay the debt-relief agency $884 a month \nthrough automatic debit for an estimated 53 months. Applicant was required to submit a \nlist of creditors to the debt-relief company which was comprised the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 3.c through 3.k. These debts total $56,948. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c through \n3.m are being resolved. The creditor listing did not include the $124 debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 3.l with a $1,360 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.m. (AX C.) \nApplicant signed the agreement on October 25, 2022. The agreement included a \nprovision where Applicant could elect to pursue bankruptcy to resolve his outstanding \ndebts, and Applicant opted to repay his creditors in lieu of bankruptcy. The agreement \nalso included a provision under which Applicant agreed to not pay any of his outstanding \ndebts that were no longer collectible under the state\u2019s statute of limitations. Applicant also \nopted out of the application of this provision. His first automated payment was made in \nNovember 2022.

(AX C.) \nAlcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \nApplicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol \n(DUI) in June 1987 while he was still in college. He was intoxicated at the time of the \narrest and testified that he knows he should not have been driving. He accepted \nresponsibility for his conduct by pleading guilty to the charge, a misdemeanor. He was \nfined and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for 90 days. He was arrested and charged \nwith DUI in June 1988 while he was still in college. Applicant testified that he was not \nintoxicated. The charge was dismissed. Applicant listed these charges on his first security \nclearance application. In June 1994, while in the Navy, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with DUI. He testified that he was not intoxicated. He was convicted of the \nreduced charge of reckless driving and fined. As a result of this charge, Applicant was \nrequired by his command to complete an alcohol education class. The program taught \nhow alcohol affected people, stating that an average man\u2019s liver processed approximately \none drink per hour. After learning this, Applicant became more cognizant of his drinking \nand was mindful to never consume more than one drink per hour. Applicant disclosed \nthese DUI arrests as required on subsequent security clearance applications. (GX 1; Tr. \n16; Tr. 31; Tr. 76-81; GX 2; Answer.) \nApplicant has been shooting pool in a league that meets on Friday nights for a \nnumber of years. In July 2019, Applicant was in a bar shooting pool. He had two or three \nbeers over the course of the evening and was not intoxicated. After having been there for \na while, Applicant become aware that several players from the other team were at the bar \nand behaving in an aggressive and angry manner. Applicant left the bar and as he was \ndriving way, a vehicle cut him off and shine a spotlight in his face. Concerned that it was \nthe players from the other team, Applicant sped up and drove away fast. The other car, \nwhich turned out to be an unmarked police car, followed Applicant\u2019s car, gained on him, \nand turned on its lights and pulled Applicant over. (Tr. 76-77; GX 2.) \nThe officer asked Applicant where he had been and he explained that he had been \nat a bar shooting pool with his pool league. The officer asked Applicant to take a \nbreathalyzer, but he refused. The officer also asked Applicant to take a field sobriety test \nwhich he instructed Applicant to perform on the sloped side of the road which was wet \nfrom rain. Applicant asked the officer if he could perform the field sobriety test on the road \nwhere it was flat, but the officer said it was too dangerous. Applicant had been advised \nby a friend who is an attorney never to take the roadside breathalyzer and never to \nperform a field sobriety test because the field sobriety test was too objective. (Tr. 76-77; \nGX 2.) \nThe officer arrested Applicant. He was detained in jail overnight and released the \nfollowing morning on his own recognizance.

However, the \ndefendant is entitled to a civil hearing where the state\u2019s attorney must present evidence \nof the defendant\u2019s intoxication. In Applicant\u2019s case, the state\u2019s attorney was unable to do \nso and Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was reinstated. Applicant and his attorney appeared in \ncriminal court and the DUI charge was dismissed and Applicant was charged with \ncareless operations, a moving violation, and fined $400. The DUI arrest and charge were \nexpunged from Applicant\u2019s record on August 25, 2022. (Tr. 18-21; GX 2; AX D.) \nIn September 2019, Applicant had been shooting pool with his pool league at a bar \nand had to or three beers while playing and was not intoxicated. He later left the bar to \nrun some errands and returned a few hours later to pick up his friend, who was \nintoxicated. While driving the friend home, Applicant was pulled over for speeding. \nApplicant\u2019s friend was behaving belligerently towards the deputy. The deputy smelled \nalcohol in the vehicle and asked Applicant to take a field sobriety test. Applicant refused, \nand the deputy arrested him on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. He \nwas detained overnight at the Sheriff\u2019s office and release the following morning on \npersonal recognizance. He appeared in court in February 2020, the deputy did not, and \nthe case was dismissed. (Tr. 18-22; GX 2.) \nSince 2019, Applicant has modified his consumption of alcohol. Despite having \nbeen taught that he could metabolize one drink per hour, when Applicant plays pool at \nbars with his pool league, he has only one beer, with food, shortly after arriving. He stated \nthat he has learned that having an officer smell alcohol in the vehicle, regardless of \nwhether or not the driver is under the influence of alcohol, can result in a DUI charge and \nhe does not want to behave in any manner that could jeopardize his security clearance. \nApplicant has also overall reduced his alcohol consumption because of the past DUI \ncharges. He does not consume any alcohol on weekdays. Occasionally on weekends, \nwhen his grandson is not staying with him, Applicant visits a friend\u2019s house to play pool \non Saturday night. Applicant will consume 4 to 5 beers during the course of the night, and \nwill then spend the night. Applicant testified that his alcohol consumption has not had any \nother negative impact on his professional or personal life. (Tr. 16-23; Tr. 77-81.) \nCharacter References \nApplicant submitted seven character-reference letters. The letters were from his \nformer supervisor from June 2018 until September 2019; Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law, a \nretired military officer who has known Applicant since 1981; a friend who has known \nApplicant for over 15 years and considers him to be a peer in the industry; a former \ncoworker who is known Applicant for over three years; Applicant\u2019s current supervisor on \none of the contracts on which Applicant works who met him socially in approximately \n2008; Applicant\u2019s other supervisor since 2018; and, a partner in the company for which \nApplicant currently works who first hired Applicant in 1997 and considers Applicant a \nfriend. Collectively, Applicant\u2019s character references described Applicant as a man of \nintegrity with sound judgment and as reliable, trustworthy, and moral. He has a reputation \nof steadfastly following rules and regulations, particularly in classified settings, and they \nhighly recommend him for maintaining his security clearance. (AX F.)

Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible while testifying. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u2026. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, corroborated by the record evidence, establishes two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nHowever, a person can mitigate concerns about his or her ability to handle and \nsafeguard classified information raised by his or her financial circumstances by \nestablishing one or more of the mitigating conditions listed under the guideline.

Specifically, in January 2014, Applicant was laid off from his job of \nover 17 years. Desp\n \nite his efforts, he did not regain full time employment in his field until \nJune 2018, and has not yet achieved as high a salary as he had at the time of being laid \noff.  From 2014 until 2016, he was underemployed as a consultant and while working for \na shipping and receiving company. Not long after he was laid off, Applicant\u2019s former \ngirlfriend moved out and created additional financial stress for Applicant. After Applicant\u2019s \nconsulting contract expired in December 2016, he was unemployed until November 2017. \nIn 2015, in an attempt to help secure reliable future employment for his step\u00ad\ndaughter, and at her request, Applicant used part of the funds in his self-directed 401(k), \nnot his income, to invest in a bar and grill for her to manage. Approximately one year later, \nApplicant\u2019s step-daughter opted to change her career path, and Applicant sold the \nbusiness for a loss. His total loss on investment was approximately $20,000. While this \ninvestment can, retrospectively, be characterized as a poor investment, Applicant was \nable to afford it at the time. \nWhile working as a consultant, Applicant did not understand his tax reporting and \npayment requirements. He also did not properly include the money he borrowed from his \n401(k), including for the investment, as income when using an online calculator to \ncalculate his taxes. He ended up owing a significant amount of Federal and state taxes \nfor tax years 2015 and 2016. \nWhile underemployed, Applicant struggled to meet his financial obligations. In an \neffort to keep his house, Applicant exhausted his financial resources, borrowed from his \n401(k), and accrued significant credit-card debt in order to maintain his mortgage-loan \npayments. However, during his 11-month period of unemployment, Applicant defaulted \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \non his mortgage loan and on his credit-card payments. Ultimately, he lost the house that \nhe had owned for more than 17 years, as well as the equity in it, in foreclosure in 2017. \nAlthough his tax debts were repaid through garnishment, Applicant acted \nresponsibly regarding his taxes by accepting the IRS\u2019s tax assessment and agreeing to \npay it. Applicant\u2019s delinquent state taxes were paid in full by April 2021 and his Federal \ntax debt was satisfied in May 2022. \nSince satisfying his tax debts, Applicant has now committed to repay his other \ndelinquent debts. The monthly payment to the debt-relief company is significantly less \nthan the monthly payment that Applicant made to resolve his outstanding taxes. Applicant \nwas able to live within his means while repaying his taxes and will be able to do so while \nrepaying his other delinquent accounts. \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.

Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe following disqualifying condition applies: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nMore than three years have passed since Applicant\u2019s last DUI arrest in September \n2019 and more than 35 years have passed since his single conviction for DUI in 1987 \nwhile in college. Applicant admits that he was driving under the influence of alcohol in \n1987, that his conduct was wrong, and that he accepted responsibility for his behavior by \npleading guilty to the charge. He was arrested and charged with DUI in 1988 and the \ncharge was dismissed. He was arrested and charged with DUI in 1994 and the charge \nwas reduced to reckless driving. He was arrested and charged in July 2019 with DUI, the \nDUI charge was dismissed, Applicant pled guilty to careless operations, a moving \nviolation, and the record of the DUI arrest and charge was expunged. He was arrested \nand charged with DUI in September 2019 and the charge was dismissed. He disclosed \nhis DUI arrests on his security clearance applications as required. \nApplicant has reduced his overall alcohol consumption since 2019. He never \nconsumes alcohol on weekdays and his infrequent alcohol consumption is moderate. He \ndoes not drive after having had more than one beer. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Directive does not define \u201crecent,\u201d and there is no \u201cbright-line\u201d definition of \nwhat constitutes \u201crecent\u201d conduct.

ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nAppellant has appropriately modified his alcohol consumption and more fully \nunderstands the negative impact that irresponsible alcohol use could have on his security \nclearance as well his personal life. Appellant\u2019s past conduct is not recent and is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and \nregulations.\u201d  \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, and \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested, charged, and pled guilty to DUI in 1987.

He was arrested \nand charged with DUI in July 2019, the charge was dismissed, and the record was \nexpunged. He was arrested and charged with DUI in September 2019 the charge was \ndismissed. \nApplicant\u2019s only DUI conviction was more than 30 years ago. Between 1994 and \n2019, a period of 25 years, Applicant was not charged with any crime or violation. It has \nbeen over three years since Applicant was charged with DUI. While Applicant has \nunequivocally stated that he was only guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol during \nhis first arrest in 1987, he has nonetheless modified his alcohol consumption to the \nmaximum of one beer with food hours before driving and reduced his overall alcohol \nconsumption. He does not want to behave in any manner that could potentially jeopardize \nhis security clearance. He has a professional reputation as having good judgment, being \nreliable, and being trustworthy. He has received outstanding evaluations since he has \nworked for his current employer beginning in 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, G, and J in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, \nbut I have also considered the following: \nApplicant served honorably in the Navy and has held a security clearance for over \n32 years. He has a professional and personal reputation of being a person with great \nintegrity who exercises good judgment and is reliable and trustworthy. He satisfied the \ntax debts alleged in the SOR and has committed to a repayment plan for his remaining \noutstanding debts, including the 2014 Federal tax debt. Applicant has modified his alcohol \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsumption and is committed to avoiding any conduct that could jeopardize his security \nclearance. He was credible and sincere during this testimony. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, G, \nand J, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and past \nconduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 1.o: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

(GE 2) \nMs. A reported that on November 21, 2016, Applicant called her into his office \nand stated that because of the Thanksgiving holiday, he would not see her for a few \ndays, and that he wanted to hug her. The hug made her uncomfortable. He made \n\u201cweird\u201d sounds similar to moaning, and he started to shake or shimmy. The following \nweek, she told him that the hugs made her uncomfortable, and she asked him to stop. \nHe apologized and said he knew that he should not hug her, but he could not control \nhimself. (GE 2) \nMs. A stated that in the middle of the day in late 2016 or early 2017, Applicant \nasked her to go with him on an errand to buy a flag.

(GE 2) \nMr. B reported that Applicant came to him and suggested that Mr. B have Ms. A\u2019s \ncommon access card (CAC) pulled after she was notified that her contract would come \nto an end.

The contract associated with Ms. A was scheduled to end in November \n2017.

He developed a \n\u201cdeeply personal\u201d relationship with her. They discussed marital issues, financial \nproblems, and their families. He realizes that he let the relationship progress beyond \nwhat he should have, but he stated that he had no romantic interest in Ms. A \nwhatsoever, and much of what she alleged was false. He stated that he never asked \nher to be his girlfriend. (Tr. at 59-67, 73-74, 99, 120, 167-168; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 2) \nApplicant stated that he hugged Ms. A as a friend about 8 to 12 times, but the \nhugs were never sexual in nature. He comes from a physically demonstrative family, \nand he hugs. He could not name another employee that he hugged behind closed \ndoors. He completely denied any moaning sounds or shaking and shimmying when they \nhugged. He stated that Ms. A initiated some of the hugs and made him uncomfortable, \nbut he hugged her to make her happy. In his February 2018 response to the notice of \nproposed removal, he stated that she told him in about September 2016 that she would \nnot mind if he kissed her, to which he refused. He admitted in that response that they \nhugged at least two times after she told him that he could kiss her. He testified that he \ndid not recall if he hugged her or invited her to lunch after she said he could kiss her. He \ncould not recall if she asked him to stop the hugs before he received the May 2017 text \nmessage, but he stopped hugging her after the text message. He continued to ask her \nto lunch.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nThe security concern for handling protected information is set out in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information-raises doubt \nabout an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security \nconcern. \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of protected information to \nunauthorized persons, including, but not limited to, personal or business \ncontacts, the media, or persons present at seminars, meetings, or \nconferences; and \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information. \nApplicant emailed the resumes of 16 job applicants to Ms. A for her to print and \nsort them.

The above disqualifying conditions are \nestablished. \nConditions that could mitigate handling protected information security concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 35. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThere is only one Guideline K allegation, and that occurred almost six years ago. \nIt is a relatively minor breach. Applicant accepted full responsibility for this aspect of his \nconduct. I find that this specific type of behavior is unlikely to recur. The above \nmitigating condition is applicable. This and other aspects of Applicant\u2019s conduct are \ndiscussed further under the personal conduct guideline. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant was found to have committed conduct \nunbecoming a federal employee, and he resigned in lieu of termination. That \nsummarization is mostly accurate, even if not exactly what occurred. Applicant appealed \nthe removal decision with the MSPB. A settlement was reached between Applicant and \nthe agency in which the agency agreed to withdraw the removal action in return for \nApplicant\u2019s voluntary resignation, which he did. The key to this allegation is Applicant\u2019s \nconduct, not the results of that conduct. I find that all of the conduct described in the \ninvestigation, including the conduct with Ms. A and the PII breach, is included in this \nallegation. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that a command investigation concluded that Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cconduct towards a female contractor was inappropriate and created an uncomfortable \nand fearful work environment for her.\u201d This apparently alleges the inappropriate conduct \nwith Ms. A, but it does not allege the PII breach. SOR \u00b6 2.b does not allege any conduct \nthat is not already alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the \nSOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 \n2.b is concluded for Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s inappropriate conduct with Ms. A and his PII breach reflect \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. The \nconduct and behavior also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(d) is applicable to the inappropriate conduct \nwith Ms. A. AG \u00b6 16(c) is applicable to the PII breach. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nIf I believed Applicant\u2019s version of events, I would find the conduct mitigated. I did \nnot find him credible, and I do not believe his version of events. The factors that went \ninto my decision include the inherent implausibility of his story and his inconsistent \nstatements. Applicant stated that he had absolutely no romantic interest in Ms. A, but he \ndrove a long distance to have lunch with her; he had a long discussion with her in his \ncar outside the airport; he drove her to his house and asked her inside; he took unusual \nactions regarding her contract; and perhaps most importantly, he continued to hug her \nand go to lunch with her after she purportedly told him that he could kiss her. Ms. A is \nimputed to have a motive to fabricate because she was told that her contract was not \nbeing funded. However, she complained about Applicant\u2019s conduct to another employee \nand the COR months before she was told about her contract. Applicant\u2019s conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \nThe SOR cross-alleges the results of the command investigation. Applicant\u2019s \nsexual harassment of Ms. A reflected a severe lack of judgment and made him \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(c) and 13(d) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nUnder the same rationale discussed above for personal conduct, Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Sexual behavior security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, D, and K in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the handling protected information security concerns, but he did not mitigate \nthe sexual behavior and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline D: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant is 50 years old and has been married since June 2009. He has no children of his own but has two adult stepchildren. He is a high school graduate. Since November 2018, he has been employed by a defense contractor. (Item 5.) Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) filed Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in December 1993, which was converted to Chapter 7 and discharged in January 1997; (2) filed Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in1999, which was discharged in March 2000; and (3) filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in August 2018, which remains open. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted those allegations with the following quoted explanations. SOR \u00b6 1.a. During this time [January 1997] I was working in [a hospital] where I slipped on wet floor and no sign was indicated floor being wet.

He submitted no response. Government Items 1 and 2, the SOR and the Answer, \nrespectively, are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 11 are admitted without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on November 17, 2022. \nFindings of Fact  \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, the Government\u2019s exhibits, \nand Applicant\u2019s Response, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 50 years old and has been married since June 2009. He has no \nchildren of his own but has two adult stepchildren. He is a high school graduate. Since \nNovember 2018, he has been employed by a defense contractor. (Item 5.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) filed Chapter 13 Bankruptcy \nin December 1993, which was converted to Chapter 7 and discharged in January 1997; \n(2) filed Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in1999, which was discharged in March 2000; and (3) filed \na Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in August 2018, which remains open. (Item 1.) Applicant \nadmitted those allegations with the following quoted explanations. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. During this time [January 1997] I was working in [a \nhospital] where I slipped on wet floor and no sign was indicated floor being \nwet. Workers compensation took about 1.5 years to release any payment \nto me which I had to hire an attorney. During this time my bills were all \nbehind and I had no financial support from family and friends. I had surgery \non left knee because of the injury I sustained. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. During this time [March 2000] I was working at . . . \nCorrectional Center where a co-worker crushed my hand on a 1500 lb door \nbecause she accidentally pushed wrong button. My right hand was crushed \nwhere I had 9 surgeries, 2 plates and 14 screws within 5 years. Workers \ncompensation in the beginning was paying me but then payments stopped \nfor more than 10 months. My attorney was able to get my payments \nreinstated and I was medically retired. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. Prior to this time [August 2018], my wife was working 60 \nhours a week. She started to have a lot of pain to where she could barely \nget out of bed. We saw numerous doctors and out-of-pocket expense was \na lot. Multiple dr. visits during the week would average to $500 a week and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat wasn\u2019t including cost for injections, mris or ct scans [and] prescription \ncost was extremely high as well. My wife has had 2 surgeries during this \ntime frame and the outcome was not great. She had to quit her job and \napply for disability. We had no other option but to file for Chapter 13 to where \nwe can still keep what we have and continue to pay on it. (Item 2.) \nFor about a decade, Applicant worked as a contractor for federal and international \nemployers. When he returned from some of those deployments, he experienced periods \nof unemployment. During a period of unemployment in 2018, he was also caring for his \nwife in their home state and for his father, who lived out of state. They both had medical \nproblems. (Items 5 and 6.) \nApplicant began experiencing financial problems not long before 1993, which lead \nto his first bankruptcy filing, a Chapter 13 in December of that year. Even though the plan \nwas amended in February 1994 not long after it was filed, he failed to make his plan \npayments. Therefore, it was converted to a Chapter 7 and discharged in January 1997. \nBut his financial problems persisted, and he filed for Chapter 7 in December 1999 which \nwas discharged in March 2000. (Items 7 and 8.) \nThereafter, Applicant seemed to be on an even keel financially, but in early 2011 \nhis financial issues resurfaced. His May and December 2015 SCAs identified delinquent \naccounts. (Items 3 and 4.) Several other accounts went into default in 2017 and 2018. \n(Item 6.) He attributed those delinquencies to his wife\u2019s medical conditions and two \nsurgeries. Her surgical outcomes were \u201cnot great.\u201d She had to quit her job and apply for \ndisability. Applicant dipped into retirement funds to attempt to defray some of the medical \nexpenses and make up for his wife\u2019s lost income. (Items 2, 5, and 6.) \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s efforts, he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection \nin August 2018. His filings showed three motor vehicles, two repossessions, and multiple \ncredit cards. The filings also showed $27,500 in unsecured debt. He estimated he and \nhis wife made a total gross monthly income of $5,500 with a net remainder of $950. (Items \n6 and 9.) \nIt has been difficult for Applicant to adhere to his plan payments. In October 2018, \nnumerous objections were file that caused an Amended Plan to be issued in November \n2018. Between January 2019 and June 2022, there were eight motions to dismiss filed \nfor nonpayment. The plan has been modified on numerous occasions, because he could \nnot afford to make plan payments. (Item 9.) In July 2022, the monthly plan payment was \nset at $1,412. But when he failed to make regular payments, a new monthly payment was \nset at $1,507. Department Counsel observed that this amount is significantly beyond the \nbudgeted $950 monthly net remainder. (Item 9.) Even though confronting obstacles to \nmake plan payments, he opened new credit cards and took out a vehicle loan for $15,763. \n(Item 11.) In his Personal Subject Interview, he offered that he has not used any debt \nconsolidation or credit counselling services.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis  \nGuideline F Financial \u2013 Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,\nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or\ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater\nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to\ngenerate funds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe followings conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant's admissions, his bankruptcy \nfilings, and the Government's credit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. The next \ninquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment,...), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances); and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant's SOR depicts a \nlong history of his financial woes that began in 1993 or before. That was, of course, \n30 years ago. But in 1999 and as recently as 2018, he was compelled to seek \nbankruptcy protection yet again. Not only are the circumstances likely to recur, they \nhave, in fact, recurred. His latest Chapter 13 is still open, and he has had trouble \nmaking plan payments in that proceeding. The admitted SOR allegations are not \nmitigated by AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have also considered mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 20(b) and (d). AG \u00b6 20(b) \nhas two requirements. First, an applicant\u2019s financial problems must have been the \nresult of conditions \u201clargely beyond\u201d his control. Second, an applicant must have \nacted \u201cresponsibly\u201d under the adverse conditions he confronted. \nIn this case, Applicant years ago faced overseas deployments that often left \nhim unemployed upon his return. In one such instance, in 2018, he returned to find \nthat his wife needed his care for a medical condition, while his father, who lived out \nof state, also had medical needs that required his attention. Add to these problems \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe difficulties Applicant described in his Answer, and it is clear he faced conditions \n\u201clargely beyond\u201d his control. The first test under AG \u00b6 20(b) is satisfied. That does \nnot, however, end the inquiry. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) also requires an applicant to act \"responsibly\" under the adverse \ncircumstances he confronted. Here, Applicant stated that his current circumstances \ngave him \u201cno option\u201d but to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. There are \nfinancial conditions where Chapter 13 is prudent and responsible conduct. This may \nbe such a financial situation. But a Chapter 13 filing itself imposes certain \nresponsibilities, chief of which is to adhere to making plan payments. Applicant has \nnot regularly made such payments, and the prognosis is not promising. And his \nrecently opened lines of credit show questionable conduct. The admitted SOR \nallegations are not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(b). \nUnder AG \u00b620(d), Applicant can be given credit for initiating a Chapter 13 as a \nmeans of being protected from creditors but also as a way of making them partially \nwhole, That would, however, require that he adhere to the plan\u2019s payment schedule. \nHe has not done so. The admitted SOR allegations are not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1. c: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information.

(Tr. 8, 17-24, 36; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nIn January 2020, Applicant completed a SCA, but under the financial section, he \ndid not disclose his delinquent federal student loans. In March 2021, he participated in a \nbackground interview with an authorized DOD investigator, and he was confronted about \nhis delinquent loans. Applicant stated that his loan forbearance had expired, but he had \nnot yet started to repay his loans because he was focusing on repaying other delinquent \naccounts. Once he had repaid his other accounts, he would then begin paying on his \nstudent loans. (GE 1, GE 2) \nApplicant completed interrogatories in October 2021.

This student loan debt relief received several extensions. In March 2020, as a result \nof the COVID-19 pandemic, the President directed the DoED to place federal student \nloans in forbearance. The federal government repeatedly extended the student loan \npayment pause. The pause includes the following relief measures for eligible loans: a \nsuspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and stopped collections on defaulted \nloans. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, https://studentaid.gov/announcements-\nevents/covid-19/. (HE 2) On February 25, 2023, the FSA website said: \nThe student loan payment pause is extended until the U.S. Department of\nEducation is permitted to implement the debt relief program or the litigation\nis resolved. Payments will restart 60 days later. If the debt relief program\nhas not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June\n30, 2023 \u2014 payments will resume 60 days after that.

(HE 4) \nApplicant testified at the hearing that he had received a basketball scholarship for \nhis undergraduate education, and it paid for his college tuition. He applied for student \nloans to fund his education for a master\u2019s degree. After graduating in 2015, he had his \nstudent loans placed into forbearance in about 2016, when his student loans became \ndue. He was aware that he would have to reapply for forbearance again when the term \nexpired, however, he could not recall if the term was one or two years. Despite knowing \nthat the forbearance would expire in one or two years, he testified he had assumed the \nloans were still in forbearance because he had never received any notification from the \nstudent loan creditor that the forbearance term had ended. (emphasis added) He realized \nhe needed to pay on his student loans at some point in time, but he just had not made it \na priority. (Tr. 18-19, 22, 25-27, 29; SOR response) \nApplicant provided inconsistent statements. He told the DOD investigator in March \n2021 that he was aware his student loans were no longer in forbearance. He also testified, \nafter further questioning by Department Counsel, that he thought his student loan \nforbearance term would expire in about 2018. He then admitted he had looked up his \nstudent loans online and realized they were outstanding. He needed to start loan \npayments, but he just did not have enough income at the time to make the loan payments. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe never initiated contact with the student loan creditor to request another loan \nforbearance, loan deferment, consolidation, or loan rehabilitation. (Tr. 29-30) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c allege Applicant is indebted to the DoED for three student \nloans referred for collection in the total amount of $55,832. The 2020 and 2022 credit \nreports showed that the three loans were opened between 2013 and 2014. Applicant \ntestified at the hearing that he called DoED two weeks before the hearing and he applied \nfor the Fresh Start program. This program assists student loan borrowers in getting their \nstudent loans out of default. (Tr. 27-32; GE 4, GE 5) \nDuring the hearing, I requested Applicant fill out a personal financial statement \n(PFS), which I sent to him after the hearing concluded. The completed PFS showed that \nhis monthly net remainder, after paying his monthly expenses, is approximately \n$3,616.15. This amount did not include payments to his student loan creditor. (AE B) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided a document from DoED dated March 3, 2023. \nThe letter stated that DoED had received Applicant\u2019s February 23, 2023 request to enroll \ninto the Fresh Start program. In about 15 days after this letter, his student loans would be \ntransferred to another loan creditor. The new loan creditor would then contact Applicant \nand provide him with an online account and the amount of his monthly payments. At the \ntime the record closed, Applicant had not yet been contacted by the new loan creditor or \nnotified of the specific amount of his monthly loan payments. (AE C) \nApplicant also submitted a screen shot of personal budgeting classes an individual \ncould purchase and complete online. The screen shot did not show that Applicant had \nenrolled into the program or that he had successfully completed the financial classes. \nThis evidence is insufficient to support his claim that he completed financial counseling. \n(AE D) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation.

It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent federal student loans as shown by the 2020 \nand 2022 credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe only delinquent debts Applicant has at this time are his three federal student \nloans totaling $55,832. He makes a six-figure income, and he has been continuously \nemployed since 2018. He was placed on notice when he filled out his SCA in January \n2020 that a security clearance holder\u2019s financial history was of security concern to the \ngovernment. In March 2021, he was confronted by the DOD authorized investigator about \nhis delinquent student loans. He answered interrogatories in October 2021, and he \nreceived his SOR in February 2022. He had plenty of opportunities to take responsible \naction to begin repaying his delinquent loans. Applicant did not initiate contact with the \nDoED until after I sent him a February 16, 2023 email to see if he would be available to \nhave his security clearance hearing on March 8, 2023. (HE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s three delinquent federal student loans are currently deferred under the \nCARES Act. Although his student loans are currently in a deferment status, it is important \nto note that he has not made any payments to this creditor, which caused them to go in \ndefault a couple of years before the CARES Act was enacted and while he was gainfully \nemployed. In March 2023, he received notice that he was accepted into the DoED Fresh \nStart program. His recent attempt to take action does not demonstrate responsible or \ngood-faith action since he only completed the DoED forms after his access to classified \ninformation was at stake with his upcoming security clearance hearing. \nI am unable to find that there were conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control which \ncontributed to his financial problems. He had a six-month period of unemployment in \n2017, and he has been continuously employed since 2018. His PFS showed he had the \nfinancial means to pay on his student loans. In the context of his security eligibility, I find \nthat Applicant did not act responsibly because he failed to dutifully address his delinquent \nstudent loans earlier. Under all of these circumstances, Applicant failed to establish that \nfinancial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were\naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s inconsistent statements in the record are troubling. He did not initiate \ncontact with his student loan creditor once he became aware that his loan forbearance \nperiod had expired. He could have made more of an effort to have the loans consolidated, \nrehabilitated, placed into deferment, or requested another loan forbearance. He also had \nseveral opportunities to take responsible action during his security clearance \ninvestigation, but he only took measures to address his student loans after he received \nnotice of his security clearance hearing. His conduct demonstrates a lack of fiscal \nresponsibility and raises unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort toward documented resolution of his delinquent student loans and \nfinancially responsible behavior, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence \nof his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude \nthat financial consideration concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 22-year-old craftsman employed by a defense contractor since July \n2018. He graduated from high school in June 2018. He resided with a cohabitant from \nDecember 2018 until they married in July 2020. He has no children. He has never held a \nsecurity clearance. (GX 1 at 7, 12, 17-18; Tr. 22) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent medical debts totaling about $25,792 that have \nbeen placed for collection. The debts are reflected in credit reports from February 2021 \nand August 2022. (GX 4; GX 5) \nApplicant testified he suffers from an autoimmune disease and his body does not \nproduce enough white blood cells. Until March 2020, he went to a hospital once a month \nfor treatment. He lived with his parents until he was 18 years old, and he was covered by \nhis father\u2019s medical insurance. (Tr. 15-17) He now has medical insurance through his \nemployer, but his white blood cell count is not low enough to be covered by his insurance. \nHe stopped obtaining treatment in March 2020. (Tr. 21-22) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in February 2021, he \ntold the investigator that he was unaware of the medical debts. However, he also told the \ninvestigator that he had a payment plan providing for monthly $50 payments to the \nhospital where he received the treatments. (GX 2) At the hearing, he testified that he \nmade one $50 payment to the collection agency in December 2020, but he had not made \nany further payments. When asked why he had not made any further payments, he \nresponded: \u201cThere\u2019s really no rhyme or reason. I just \u2013 because I looked at my credit one \ntime and saw that I had been going up, even though those bills were in collections, I didn\u2019t \ndo anything about it and didn\u2019t think twice about it.\u201d He does not believe that the lack of a \nclearance will have any financial impact on his career. (Tr. 25-27) \nApplicant\u2019s foreman considers him a proficient mechanic who has an exceptional \nwork ethic and sometimes goes beyond his assignments. He states that Applicant needs \na security clearance to be able to work as a pipefitter in restricted areas of submarines. \n(AX A) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, his testimony at the hearing, and the evidence submitted \nby Department Counsel at the hearing establish the following disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nNone of the above conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s debts are recent, \nnumerous, and were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. While \nhis autoimmune disease is a condition beyond his control, he has not acted responsibly \nto address the medical debts that resulted from his treatment. He has not sought or \nreceived financial counseling. He has not disputed any of the debts. He has the financial \nability to resolve the debts but has chosen to ignore them. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid and sincere at the \nhearing, but he appears to lack the maturity and sense of responsibility expected of \npersons entrusted with access to classified information. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(AE P) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further inquiry is necessary about the potential \napplication of any mitigation conditions. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n[full cite here] Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt, and her financial problems are not isolated. Her debt, \nparticularly as it pertains to her delinquent taxes, remains a \u201ccontinuing course of \nconduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are partially applicable. The personal and family problems \ndescribed above played a role in Applicant\u2019s inability to remain current on her financial \nobligations. However, Applicant does not receive full credit under either of these two \nmitigating conditions because of her failure to act responsibly under the circumstances \nand the time that elapsed before addressing these obligations. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable \nto SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e insofar as Applicant has made relatively recent \narrangements with the IRS and state tax authority to pay her delinquent taxes and is in \ncompliance with those arrangements. Her post-hearing documents did not mitigate her \nfailure to file her 2014 and 2018 tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.m, and AG \u00b6 20(f) is not applicable. \nOf great concern is the fact that Applicant did not timely file her Federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2014 to 2018. She is also indebted to the Federal \nGovernment for tax years 2015 and 2016 and to her state tax authority for tax years \n2014 and 2015. Applicant was alerted to the fact that her failure to address her Federal \nand state tax situation, as well as her other outstanding debts, was a concern to the \nGovernment during her June 24, 2020 OPM PSI and later when she received her \nJanuary 27, 2022 SOR. Although these events apparently prompted Applicant to \nrecognize the seriousness of her situation, she failed to mitigate all of the identified \nconcerns. Her explanations for failure to maintain a state of financial responsibility are \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot convincing given the time elapsed, especially as it pertains to her student loans and \ntaxes. The evidence of record does not completely mitigate such a lapse in judgment. In \nparticular, the evidence demonstrates that Applicant did not act responsibly with regard \nto timely filing her Federal and state income tax returns. I have credited her with paying \nor making payment arrangements for taxes known to be owed by mitigating SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.d, and 1.e. \nFurthermore, and in regard to the failure to file timely Federal income tax returns \nwhen due, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016): \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). (emphasis in original) \nSee ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplying the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are not mitigated. \nApplicant made enough progress on the six smaller debts (all less than $1,000) \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i to 1.n to mitigate them. However, her failure to file all overdue tax returns \nand show a track record of making payments toward her student loan debts before the \nstudent loan deferment create unmitigated financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the \nAnalysis section under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. \nHowever, further comments are warranted. \nApplicant is a 61-year-old program management specialist, who has been \nemployed by a defense contractor since March 2020. She seeks a Secret security \nclearance as a requirement of her continued employment. Her supervisor and \nreferences support her in this endeavor. Based on her manager\u2019s recommendation, as \nwell as the recommendations of her other references, it is clear that she is highly \nregarded. She has all the indicators of an upwardly mobile individual with a bright future \nahead of her. \nHowever, for the last eight years, beginning with tax year 2014, Applicant has \nfailed to fulfill one of the most fundamental hallmarks of U.S. citizenship, which is the \ntimely filing of her Federal and state income tax returns and paying taxes when due. \nThis is especially crucial for an individual seeking a security clearance and working for a \ndefense contractor advancing the national security of the United States. From the \nevidence presented, despite being made aware that the timely filing and payment of her \nFederal and state income tax returns was a security concern, Applicant failed to comply \nwith this basic and fundamental obligation. She is a bright and talented individual, who \nis more than capable of addressing her income tax problems in a responsible way. I \ngave mitigation credit to debts Applicant has resolved or is attempting to resolve. She is \nto be commended for the progress she made in addressing those debts. However, \ngiven her current financial state, more remains to be done to set her financial house in \norder, especially as it pertains to her taxes and remaining debts. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of financial responsibility necessary for award of a security \nclearance in the future. With more effort toward establishing a track record of behavior \nconsistent with her financial obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \n    Subparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.e: \n    Subparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.h: \n   Subparagraphs 1.i \u2013 1.n: \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 20, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guidelines J and E. The CAS acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 5, 2022, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 30, 2022, \nand the case was assigned to me on August 8, 2023.

Department Counsel amended the SOR on \nSeptember 5, 2023, adding an additional allegation (SOR \u00b6 2.b) under Guideline E. The \nadditional allegation was mislabeled as SOR \u00b6 2.a. On a date not reflected in the record, \nthe additional allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b was amended. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 13 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of five witnesses, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which were admitted without objection. AX A \nconsists of two documents, AX B consists of 22 documents, AX C consists of 80 \ndocuments, AX D consists of 10 documents, and AX E consists of 8 documents. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on September 22, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.d, 1.f, and 1.i. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.c, 1.g, and 1.h. He did not admit or \ndeny the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 2,a, and 2.b as amended. His admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He married in \nFebruary 1988, separated in January 2017, divorced in August 2017, and remarried in \nAugust 2020. (GX 12 at 4; Tr. 87) He has two adult children. He received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in mechanical engineering in August 1994 and a master\u2019s degree in engineering \nmanagement in May 2002. He has worked for defense contractors since April 2009. \nApplicant enlisted in the Navy in November 1987, was an honor graduate of his \ninitial training classes, received outstanding performance evaluations and numerous \ncommendations, and was selected for the enlisted commissioning program. He \ncompleted the Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps and was commissioned as an ensign. \nHis fitness reports through October 2006 were uniformly outstanding and included \nrecommendations for promotion to commander and assignment as an executive officer \nafloat. (AX C(1) through AX C(80)). He received the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement \nMedal three times, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal three times, and \nthe Meritorious Service Medal upon retirement as a lieutenant commander in December \n2007. \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted on cross-examination that in 2005, he was \naccused of fraternization, making a false official statement, and adultery, and that he \naccepted a captain\u2019s mast for those offenses. He admitted that he was found guilty and \nreceived a letter of reprimand and forfeiture of pay, and he was removed from the ship. \n(Tr. 205-06) The record contains no documentary evidence of this action, his fitness \nreports for that period do not mention it, and it was not alleged in the SOR. I have \nconsidered it for the limited purpose of rebutting Applicant\u2019s evidence of a stellar Navy \ncareer. \nShortly after Applicant and first his wife separated, he began dating ML, who also \nwas separated from her spouse. Applicant and his wife had been friends of ML and her \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhusband for several years, and the two couples had shared many common interests (Tr. \n178-79) According to Applicant, he and ML stopped dating because ML was concerned \nabout her three daughters. (Tr. 180) \nBefore Applicant and ML started dating, he had loaned her a laptop, he had loaned \nher husband a pressure washer, and he had left a set of weights in their garage. Applicant \nadmitted that, after asking for the return of his property several times, he sent some \u201cpretty \npointed\u201d emails to ML and her husband, saying that he wanted his property returned. ML\u2019s \nhusband interpreted his emails as threats, and he obtained a protective order against \nApplicant in April 2018. (Tr. 180-81) The protective order is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, but the \nbasis for the order is not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant met TR through an online dating service, and they began dating in May \n2017. Their relationship ended in March 2018. After they broke up, two laptops were \nstolen from TR\u2019s home, and Applicant was accused of stealing them. In April 2017, he \nwas arrested and charged with grand larceny, burglary, vandalism, and violating a \nprotective order. (GX 7) In April 2019, he was convicted of breaking and entering, a felony, \nand petit larceny, a misdemeanor. A sentencing hearing was conducted in August 2019. \nIn September 2019, he was sentenced to four years in jail for the breaking and entering \nand 12 months for the petit larceny offense, suspended for five years on the conditions of \ngood behavior and no contact with TR. (GX 6) He is still on probation. His arrest, \nconviction, and sentence are alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nOn October 25, 2020, Applicant was charged with sending threatening text \nmessages to TR. (GX 2) On October 28, 2020, he was charged with stalking TR, and he \nwas served with an emergency protective order. (GX 3) The record does not reflect the \ndisposition of the charges of sending threatening text messages and stalking. The stalking \ncharge and the protective order are alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nIn September 2017, Applicant was issued a summons for larceny from a military \nexchange store. He was accused of taking a small box of cologne, removing the cologne \nfrom the box, and placing it in the pocket of the athletic shorts that he was wearing. (GX \n9) His trial was delayed several times because the security officer from the exchange did \nnot appear. (Tr. 175-76) In June 2018, he pleaded no contest, was convicted of petit \nlarceny, and was sentenced to 10 days in jail, suspended, and one year of unsupervised \nprobation. (GX 11 at 7; GX 12 at 7) In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation \nbut asserted that his conduct was unintentional and the result of inattention and \ndistraction. At the hearing, he testified that he was carrying bottles of wine while in the \nstore, when his cellphone rang. He placed the wine on the checkout counter and put the \ncologne in his pocket. He paid for the wine but forgot to pay for the cologne. He was \nleaving the store when he was confronted by a store security officer. The security officer \nrefused to allow him to pay for the cologne and called the police. (Tr. 171-75) The arrest, \nconviction, and sentence are alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. \nIn October 2017, ML reported to the police that Applicant had posted partially nude \nphotos of her in front of a local business. (GX 8) The charge was based on ML\u2019s \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nspeculation that Applicant was the only person who had the photos. When Applicant was \ninterviewed by a security investigator in September 2021, he told the investigator that he \nbelieved his ex-wife posted the photos. (GX 11 at 9) At the hearing, he submitted a \nstatement from a friend who believed that Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and some friends posted \nthe photos, because he had observed them posting the same photos on the portable \ntoilets at a wine festival. (AX D(7)) Applicant was charged with obscenity by disseminating \nphotos to harass. (GX 8) In his answer to the SOR, he denied being convicted. The arrest, \ncharge, and conviction are alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, but there is no evidence of a conviction. \nIn April 2018, the Federal Bureau of Investigation received a report that Applicant \nhad impersonated a federal agent. (GX 10) The record contains no evidence of the source \nof the complaint or its disposition. Applicant testified that he had no knowledge of such \nan incident. (Tr. 176-77) The complaint is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nIn about March or April 2018, Applicant began dating AK, an acquaintance of TR. \nAK lost a diamond earring in Applicant\u2019s home, and he found it after their relationship \nended. He offered to return the earning to AK if she would reimburse him for lodging \nexpenses that he incurred for her son while participating in an athletic tournament. Even \nthough AK ignored the request for reimbursement, he returned the earring. Several weeks \nlater, someone slashed the tires in AK\u2019s vehicle, and she told police that she suspected \nthat her tires were slashed by Applicant. She admitted that she did not see who slashed \nher tires, but she believed, \u201cbased upon their history,\u201d he was involved either directly or \nby hiring someone. In August 2019, Applicant was charged with vandalism. There is no \nevidence that he was convicted. The police records reflect the disposition as \u201cexceptional \nclearance adult.\u201d (GX 5) The vandalism charge is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c.  \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that In July 2018, a two-year protective order was issued \nagainst Applicant. There is no documentary evidence in the record reflecting this \nprotective order. \nIn October 2020, TR reported to the police that Applicant had been sending her \nthreatening text messages and stalking her, and an emergency protective order was \nissued against Applicant. (GX 2; GX 3) The threatening messages, a stalking charge, and \nthe protective order are alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nAn attorney who represented Applicant in several matters alleged in the SOR \ntestified that in his jurisdiction, a protective order is granted in an ex parte proceeding in \nwhich the respondent does not have a right to be present. He also testified that the judges \nin the jurisdiction where Applicant then resided routinely granted requests for protective \norders on scant evidence, on the theory that they do not harm the respondent and they \n\u201cwould rather be safe than sorry.\u201d (AX A(1); Tr. 119-22) \nApplicant\u2019s employment record from February 2010 to March 2023, was replete \nwith commendations, pay raises, and accolades. (AX B(1) through B(22) Nevertheless, \nhe was laid off without prior notice on March 1, 2023, when his company was acquired \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nby a private equity firm and the merger of the two organizations resulted in eliminating his \njob. (AX E) He was hired by another defense contractor on the following day. (AX E(8)) \nAccording to an incident report submitted by Applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s security \nofficer, dated March 13, 2023, Applicant subsequently called a business partner of the \ncompany and threatened the senior executives and the company. This incident was \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a, but it was later amended to allege that he called a business partner \nof the company, using profanity and derogatory language, and said he intended to create \nproblems for the senior executives and the company. (GX 13) \nApplicant testified that he called a former colleague and asked about his abrupt \ntermination. The former colleague was the recipient of the phone call alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n2.a. He knew that Applicant was upset and told him to calm down and think about how to \nmove forward. (Tr. 168) His former colleague testified that he talked to Applicant as both \na friend and a colleague. He explained to Applicant that the company had been acquired \nby private equity firm and the merger of the two organizations resulted in eliminating \nApplicant\u2019s job. He was aware that Applicant received no advance notice that he would \nbe terminated. He described Applicant as flabbergasted and obviously angry. He testified, \n\u201cThere was no threat, it was just an upset person, as anyone would be upset in that \nsituation.\u201d He is confident that Applicant was laid off to trim management levels and not \nbecause of the conduct alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 68) \nThe former colleague who received the phone call testified that he has held a \nsecurity clearance for more than 25 years. Applicant was still on active duty, in 2008 or \n2009, when they met. Their relationship started out as purely professional but then grew \ninto a social relationship. In his opinion, Applicant is very talented and well respected in \nthe entire maritime community. \nThe former colleague testified that he was familiar with the allegations in the SOR \nand still believes that Applicant should hold a security clearance. (Tr. 44-54) He admitted \nthat he was surprised at some of the conduct alleged in the SOR. He testified that, if he \nsaw similar conduct while doing a background check, he would have to take a second \nlook and exercise due diligence. (Tr. 62) The former colleague submitted a written \nstatement encapsulating the views he expressed at the hearing. (AX D(2)) \nApplicant also telephoned his program manager and asked him if he thought the \ntermination was handled properly. He testified that the program manager agreed that it \nwas not handled properly. (Tr. 169) \nAnother friend and former co-worker of Applicant, who holds a top secret clearance \nand is a senior executive of a defense contractor, submitted a statement and testified at \nthe hearing. She has known Applicant for about four years as a friend and a business \ncolleague. She described Applicant as an honest, thoughtful, easy-going person, and \ncandid, but respectful and considerate of others. (AX D(4)) She was unaware that the \nSOR alleged that Applicant had threatened any of the executives of his former employer. \nPrior to reading the SOR, she was unaware of any of the conduct alleged in it.

Aside from her personal \nopinions about Applicant, she believes that he enjoys a reputation for trustworthiness, as \nevidenced by the fact that he was offered another job shortly after he was terminated. (Tr. \n25-34) She admitted that she would have to \u201cthink hard\u201d about hiring someone who was \nconvicted of a felony. (Tr. 39) \nAnother friend and professional colleague, who has known Applicant for ten years \nand who has considerable experience in evaluating applicants for security clearances, \nconsiders Applicant to be trustworthy, reliable, and responsible. He reviewed the SOR \nand opined that Applicant\u2019s security clearance should be continued. (AX D(1)) \nAnother friend of Applicant who has known him since they were five years old \ntestified on his behalf and submitted a written statement supporting Applicant. This friend \nis an Army veteran, a former foreign service officer, a former defense contractor, and now \nowns his own business. He reviewed the SOR and believes that the alleged shoplifting \nwas the product of the inattention and distraction. He would not hire someone with a \nrecord like the SOR without asking questions. He was hesitant to comment on the conduct \nalleged in the SOR without knowing more facts, but he unequivocally stated that he \nbelieves Applicant is a trustworthy and reliable person. (Tr. 79-83; AX D(6)) \nAnother friend, who has known Applicant for 20 years, is a licensed realtor and \nexecutive director of a non-profit organization, states that Applicant is one of the most \ntrustworthy and loyal people he knows. (AX D(7) \nAnother friend who worked with Applicant until 2019 regarded him as a talented, \nresourceful, hardworking, and responsible engineer. The friend is now retired from federal \nservice and is a senior vice-president and program manager for a defense contractor. He \ntried to recruit Applicant to work for his company but was unable because of the ongoing \nissues with his security clearance. (AX D(8)) \nApplicant\u2019s son is employed by a defense contractor and holds a top-secret \nclearance. He admires Applicant for his diligent and efficient work ethic. He regards him \nas a selfless and generous person. Applicant taught him to be respectful, kind, and \npatient, and to \u201ctake a step back and reflect on situations instead of reacting irrationally \nto difficult circumstances. (AX D(9)) \nApplicant met his current spouse in July 2019, and they married in August 2020. \nHis spouse has never held a security clearance. She testified that she was familiar with \nall the conduct alleged in the SOR, and that Applicant was very open about what had \nhappened during his various relationships. She testified that she knew Applicant was not \nguilty of slashing AK\u2019s tires and sending threatening text messages to TR because they \nwere together when those incidents allegedly occurred. (Tr. 93-94) She believes that \nApplicant is a loyal, hardworking, intelligent, generous, trustworthy person.

(AE D(10)) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing are sufficient to \nestablish the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, and 1.i. The protective orders alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f and as part of SOR \u00b6 1.a are procedures to protect the health and \nsafety of a petitioner. While violations of protective orders are criminal conduct, the \nprotective orders are not criminal offenses. They are civil actions intended to prevent \ncriminal offenses. See e.g. [State] Code, \u00a7 19.2-152.10; see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, \n2.d Ed.,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n https://thelawdictionary.org/protective-order. Thus, I conclude that the allegations \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f are not established, because they do not allege criminal \nconduct. Furthermore, because SOR 1\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f do not allege the basis for the \nprotective orders, they fall short of the specificity required by the Directive \u00b6 E.3.1.3. \nThe conduct that was the basis the protective order was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but \nit was not alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f. Unalleged conduct may not be an \nindependent basis for revoking a security clearance. \nApplicant denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c (vandalism). The charge was based \non the speculation of AK that he was the perpetrator. It is not established. \nApplicant denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.e (impersonating a federal agent). The \nrecord contains no evidence of the basis for this allegation or its disposition. It is not \nestablished. \nApplicant admitted being charged with the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h \n(harassment), but denied being convicted. The charge was based on weak speculative \nevidence from ML and refuted by the statement of Applicant\u2019s friend (the realtor). It is not \nestablished. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he was convicted of the criminal conduct in alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.g, but he denied that he was guilty of the offenses. The doctrine of \ncollateral estoppel generally applies in DOHA hearings and precludes applicants from \ncontending that they did not engage in criminal acts for which they were convicted. ISCR \nCase No. 95-0817 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 1997). There are exceptions to this general \nrule, especially with respect to misdemeanor convictions based on guilty pleas. Relying \non federal case law, the Appeal Board has adopted a three-part test to determine the \nappropriateness of applying collateral estoppel to misdemeanor convictions. First, the \napplicant must have been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the \ncriminal trial. Second, the issues presented for collateral estoppel must be the same as \nthose resolved against the applicant in the criminal trial. Third, the application of collateral \nestoppel must not result in \u201cunfairness,\u201d such as where the circumstances indicate lack \nof incentive to litigate the issues in the original trial. Federal courts recognize that an \nindividual may not have an incentive to fully litigate a misdemeanor offense because there \nis less at stake or because a plea bargain creates a disincentive to litigate the issues. \nISCR Case No. 04-05712, (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006).  \nI conclude that collateral estoppel applies to Applicant\u2019s conviction of breaking and \nentering and petit larceny, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. It does not apply to Applicant\u2019s plea of \nno contest to the larceny alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. The offense alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i was a \nmisdemeanor, and Applicant did not think there was much at stake. I found his \nexplanation for leaving the exchange without paying for the cologne plausible and \nreasonable. I conclude that he has refuted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.i. \nThe criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g is sufficient to establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s most recent criminal conduct was three \nyears ago, but he is still under the pressure of complying with the terms of his probation. \nHis criminal conduct did not occur under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is established for the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.h. There \nwas no reliable evidence to support these allegations. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is not established. Applicant\u2019s felony conviction, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, \noccurred more than four years ago. His community service after a hurricane was \ncommendable. However, he submitted no evidence of his performance in his current job. \nHe will be on probation until September 2024, and I am not confident that he will not revert \nto his track record of irresponsible conduct after his probation ends. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the Guideline J conduct under this guideline. SOR \u00b6 \n2.b alleges that Applicant called a business partner of his former employer, using \nprofanity and other derogatory language, and said that he intended to create problems \nfor the senior executives and the company. The security concern is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d  \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is established for the cross-allegation of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g. SOR \u00b6 \n2.b is not established. The executive who received the alleged threatening telephone call \nfrom Applicant described their conversation and established that the threats alleged in \nthe SOR did not occur. \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 16(e): \u201cpersonal conduct, or \nconcealment of information about one's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or \ngroup. Such conduct includes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d This disqualifying condition is \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s involvement with ML, the married spouse of a close friend, \nand a felony conviction. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 17(f): the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of \nquestionable reliability. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant was convicted of a felony and is still on \nprobation. His misconduct was not infrequent and did not happen under unique \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is not established. Applicant has acknowledged some of his behavior, \nbut he submitted no evidence of counseling. Based on his track record of inappropriate \nand dysfunctional relationships, I am not satisfied that his inappropriate behavior is \nunlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(f) is established for the allegation that Applicant impersonated a federal \nagent. It is not established for the other conduct cross-alleged under Guideline J. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary service, and the accolades from former business colleagues.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 49 years old. He married in 2015 for the fourth time. He has one adult child from his first marriage and two minor children from his third marriage. He shares parental custody with his ex-wife. He has been employed by a federal contractor since April 2020. (Transcript (Tr.) 14-19, 60-62) In February 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while ability impaired with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over .05% but less than .08% and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He was found guilty of DUI. Applicant testified that he was with friends watching a football game over three to four hours and consumed some alcohol. He then drove and another car lost control and collided with Applicant head on. He admitted to the police that he had consumed alcohol and a breathalyzer was administered, which recorded his BAC. The actual BAC is unknown, but it was less than .08%. Applicant has not had any other alcohol-related incidents. (Tr. 20-21) Applicant saw his same family doctor from 2010 to 2020 until he moved to a new state. In approximately 2014, Applicant began experiencing anxiety. He was in a stressful job that required him to dismiss ",

I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 13. Applicant and three witnesses testified. \nHe offered Applicant exhibits (AE) A through D. There were no objections to any exhibits \noffered and they were admitted in evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript on \nJanuary 23, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He denied the SOR \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.a and 2.b. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of \nfact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 49 years old. He married in 2015 for the fourth time. He has one adult \nchild from his first marriage and two minor children from his third marriage. He shares \nparental custody with his ex-wife. He has been employed by a federal contractor since \nApril 2020. (Transcript (Tr.) 14-19, 60-62) \nIn February 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while ability \nimpaired with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over .05% but less than .08% and \ndriving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He was found guilty of DUI. Applicant testified \nthat he was with friends watching a football game over three to four hours and consumed \nsome alcohol. He then drove and another car lost control and collided with Applicant head \non. He admitted to the police that he had consumed alcohol and a breathalyzer was \nadministered, which recorded his BAC. The actual BAC is unknown, but it was less than \n.08%. Applicant has not had any other alcohol-related incidents. (Tr. 20-21) \nApplicant saw his same family doctor from 2010 to 2020 until he moved to a new \nstate. In approximately 2014, Applicant began experiencing anxiety. He was in a stressful \njob that required him to dismiss other employees. He said it was not the job he had agreed \nto when he was hired. The stress of the job was affecting his health. He was treated by \nhis family doctor and diagnosed with general anxiety. He was prescribed medication in \n2014, which helped relieve his symptoms. When the stressors diminished, he felt better. \nAlthough he saw his family doctor on a regular basis, his appointments were not always \nrelated to stress, but were also for other medical reasons. Applicant credibly testified that \nhe was not treated for anxiety from 2014 to 2019 as is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but rather \nacute situations periodically created stress and anxiety which were then treated. These \nwere not chronic conditions but more related to situational factors. When the stressors \ndecreased, his anxiety diminished. (Tr. 31-33) \nIn May 2017, Applicant recognized he was consuming too much alcohol and \nvoluntarily sought treatment. He attributed his consumption to a period when he and his \nex-wife were dealing with custody of their children. He shared custody of his children with \nhis ex-wife and had the children every other week. For a period, his older child lived with \nhim. His ex-wife\u2019s husband was transferred to a new location and visitation became more \ndifficult for him. Applicant was close to his children and missed them.

Applicant continues to visit them \nregularly, and they have a good relationship. (Tr. 22-25, 38; GE 4, 5) \nApplicant voluntarily admitted himself into a five-day detoxification program in May \n2017. He was diagnosed with Alcohol Dependence. He testified that he started \nconsuming alcohol and he gradually increased the amount he was consuming up to a full \nbottle of alcohol a day before he sought treatment. He admitted he was a heavy drinker \nfor about a year before admitting himself to the detoxification program. He testified that \nhe was physically dependent on alcohol when he entered the program. He said that at \nthe recommendation of the treatment center, he participated in outpatient treatment for \nsix months until the program was completed. He participated in Alcoholic Anonymous \n(AA) as part of the after-care program. He went to two to three meetings a week at the \ntime. He has not participated in AA since then. He said it was not the right program for \nhim. He stated that as the physical dependence decreased, his depression improved, and \nalcohol was no longer an issue. (Tr. 25-26, 38-44, 54-55; GE 4, 5) \nApplicant testified that he abstained from alcohol consumption for about six months \nafter the detoxification program. He then occasionally had a drink if he was on vacation \nor having a special dinner, but he was not consuming it daily. He no longer craved it. He \nestablished a moderate drinking pattern. (Tr. 26) \nApplicant was on medical leave from his job for anxiety prior to May 2016.When \nhis medical leave was terminated, he was unemployed until May 2017. He said he did not \ndrink while he was working. He was terminated from his job because he was taking \nmedical leave related to anxiety and the stressors associated with the expectations of the \njob, which he could not perform. He admitted that when he was denied further medical \nleave, it likely had an impact on his drinking. (Tr. 44-45) \nIn 2019, Applicant requested medical leave from his employer related to the stress \nand anxiety that he was experiencing due to custody issues with his children. He was \nalso moving to a new state for a position that was a significant distance from where his \nchildren were living. He attempted to work remotely to be closer to his children, but his \nrequest was denied. Applicant testified that in the past he has used alcohol to manage \ndepression, anxiety, stress, and physical pain. He has learned from his past mistakes \nwhen he tried to resolve his problems by himself. He now knows when he needs to reach \nout for help. He recognizes the triggers that impact his decisions and he attended therapy \nduring his child custody case. He is presently not participating in treatment. (Tr. 30-31, \n56-57) \nIn late 2021, Applicant was experiencing a serious physical medical condition and \nhe was using alcohol to relieve the pain for about two to three months in the evenings to \nhelp him sleep. He admitted he was self-medicating. He said his doctor was aware that \nhe was consuming alcohol. His doctor did not believe he was becoming physically \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndependent on alcohol but concurred the amount of alcohol he was consuming at the time \nwas excessive. (Tr. 47-50, 62-65; GE 3) \nIn December 2021, Applicant had surgery for his medical condition. He did not \nconsume alcohol for four months after the surgery. Upon a follow-up medical \nappointment, he was told by his doctor that he could consume alcohol periodically, but \nnot on a regular basis because it would have a negative effect on his medical condition. \nHe subsequently consumed alcohol while on vacation. He testified that he had also \nconsumed one drink on a few other occasions, and it was a low alcohol-content beer. He \nlater had additional medical tests, and the doctor told him that given his autoimmune \ndisorder, it would be better for his health to completely abstain from alcohol consumption. \nSubsequently, he has not had alcohol since May 2022. His wife no longer consumes \nalcohol. They do not have alcohol in the house. (Tr. 27-31, 50-52, 58-60; GE 3) \nApplicant testified that he has found outlets to help him reduce stress. He now lives \nin an area that is not as demanding. He and his wife have found a core group of friends \nthat are a support group, which he previously did not have. They are also an important \nsocial circle for him and his wife. He can talk to intimately to this group, which helps him \nfrom internalizing issues. He has taken up woodworking and other hobbies which provide \nsignificant help in reducing his stress. (Tr. 68-70) \nApplicant testified that he does not believe he is an alcoholic, but admits he abused \nalcohol in the past, and his excessive use was triggered by stressful events in his life, for \nwhich he sought help. (Tr. 38-39) \nIn November 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist, Dr. B. She \nindicated that based on her interview, available medical records, a security investigation \nfile, and psychological screening that Applicant met the criteria for alcohol use disorder, \nmild; major depressive disorder; panic disorder; anxiety; and narcissistic personality. The \nlatter she noted likely contributed to work-related difficulties. She noted he had a history \nof severe alcohol use disorder, continued to consume alcohol, and he was not currently \nparticipating in treatment. She noted that Applicant\u2019s statements suggested he was \nunwilling to acknowledge the psychological components of his use disorder, despite \nstatements that it was a \u201ccoping mechanism.\u201d She opined that Applicant was unlikely to \nbe able to safeguard sensitive information and his judgment was poor. She opined that \nApplicant appeared deceptive and dishonest and his prognosis was poor. (GE 2) \nApplicant credibly testified that Dr. B.\u2019s medical evaluation consisted of a 60-to-90-\nminute ZOOM conference call during which the video connection was disrupted, jumpy \nand choppy, and would break up several times. The audio on the ZOOM call did not work, \nso Dr. B had Applicant call her on the telephone. Dr. B made no mention of the intermittent \ndifficulties with the video or audio connection during the evaluation and its potential \nnegative impact on her personal observations of Applicant. (Tr. 34-35, 70-71) Of interest \nwas Dr. B\u2019s comment: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe was observed to take long pauses and reduce eye contact once he was \nrepeatedly asked to respond to the question at hand. He also chuckled at \nnearly all questions presented, despite the fact that the questions were \ndirect and non-humorous. His presentation was consistent with that of \npatients attempting to present as self-assured, though actually quite \ninsecure and manipulative to those around him. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified that due to the connectivity difficulty with the ZOOM evaluation \nand being generally nervous about having a psychological evaluation that he likely was \nnot his normal self. (Tr. 35-37) \nDr. B had Applicant take the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). She stated \nthe following: \nValidity scales indicated that [Applicant] was consistent and honest in his \nresponse style. This indicated that the consequent profile is a reasonable \ndepiction of the applicant\u2019s self-appraisal. There were no indications of \npsychological impairment on the PAI clinical profile. His responses indicate \nthat [Applicant\u2019s] interests/motivation for treatment is comparable to that of \nadults who are not being seen in a therapeutic setting. Moreover, his level \nof treatment motivation is somewhat lower than is typical of individuals \nbeing seen in treatment settings. His responses suggest that he is satisfied \nwith himself as he is, that he is not experiencing marked distress, and that, \nas a result, he sees little need for changes in his behavior. \nBased on his responses, his interpersonal style seems best characterized \nas self-assured, confident, and dominant. Although not unfriendly, he is \nlikely to be described by others as ambitious and having a \u201cleader-like\u201d \ndemeanor. He is comfortable in social settings, but is not likely to mix \nindiscriminately, preferring to interact with others in situations over which he \ncan exercise some measure of control. (GE 2) \nDr. B noted in her report that Applicant was not able to obtain custody of his \nchildren. Her statement is inaccurate. Applicant has always had joint legal custody of his \nchildren and continues to do so. He is involved in their lives and participates with their \nmother in decision-making for the children. (Tr. 35-36; GE 2). \nDr. B\u2019s comments under her diagnostic impressions, note that Applicant met the \ncriteria for alcohol use disorder, mild, and commented \u201cat the very least.\u201d She noted that \nit was based on Applicant\u2019s self-assessment, but she found he lacked candor. He was \nnot in treatment and did not acknowledge he was an alcoholic. She believed he was \nunwilling to acknowledge the components of his alcohol use disorder and his insight was \nlimited. She found he was \u201cunlikely to be a reliable employee, as his work history shows.\u201d \nShe determined his judgment was poor and he \u201cappears deceptive and dishonest, putting \nhis trustworthiness in question\u201d and his prognosis is \u201cvery poor.\u201d (GE 2) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified on his behalf. She has known Applicant since 2014. She \nconfirmed that Applicant does not have a current issue with alcohol. They have attempted \nto reduce their stress and since moving to a new state they have been successful. She \nconfirmed he has found activities to help him. In 2017, she was concerned about his \nalcohol consumption, but was satisfied when he voluntarily went through detoxification. \nShe recognized that he had issues with anxiety, depression, and alcohol in the past, but \nstated that he has addressed them. She has read the psychological report by Dr. B and \nemphatically disagrees with her assessment, especially the narcissism diagnosis. She \nsaid the Applicant goes out of his way to be nice and puts her before himself. He strives \nto do the right thing. They have a happy home and take care of each other. She and her \nhusband no longer consume alcohol and there is none in their home. (Tr. 74-85) \nApplicant\u2019s father testified. He acknowledged that Applicant addressed his issues \nwith alcohol, and it has not been a problem in the past couple of years. He believes \nApplicant\u2019s mental health is good. He was aware that Applicant went through a difficult \ntime when he was dealing with custody issues. (Tr. 87-90) \nA friend of Applicant\u2019s testified on his behalf. They worked together at one time \nand are good friends. He is aware that Applicant is applying for a security clearance. He \nhas no concerns about granting him access. (Tr. 91-95) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nIn 1995, Applicant was convicted of DUI with a BAC of greater than .05% and less \nthan .08%. In 2017, he admitted himself for alcohol treatment and completed a five-day \ndetoxification program. In 2021, a psychologist diagnosed him with alcohol use disorder, \nmild. There is substantial evidence that he was consuming large quantities of alcohol \nbefore he entered detoxification and then later to relieve pain. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c) and \n22(d) apply. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant failed to follow \ntreatment advice or recommendations after being diagnosed. AG\u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) do \nnot apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \nApplicant\u2019s DUI was in 1995. It is the only alcohol-related incident alleged. In 2017, \nhe voluntarily admitted himself for detoxification and successfully completed the program \nand aftercare. Applicant has acknowledged that due to stressors in his life he was \nconsuming large quantities of alcohol before he sought treatment in 2017. He admitted \nhe consumed alcohol before he had surgery in late 2021 due to physical pain and to help \nhim sleep. He subsequently consumed minimal alcohol after his surgery and has \nabstained since May 2022. He credibly testified that he has found alternative ways to deal \nwith stress, including the support of his wife and a group of friends. Due to medical \nconcerns, his doctor recommends he not consume alcohol and he has been compliant, \nas reported by his wife. There is sufficient evidence that he has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption. It has been 28 years since Applicant\u2019s only \nalcohol-related incident. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant went through some tumultuous periods in \nhis life when he had a stressful job and when he encountered child custody issues, and \nlater when his children were geographically relocated. He is now in a better emotional \nplace and has the support to ensure future issues do not occur. Although at times he was \ndrinking to excess, he recognized that his consumption was an issue and has taken steps \nto significantly to modify it. I found his commitment to sobriety at this time credible, and \nthe facts demonstrate that his issues are under control and unlikely to recur. I find that his \nbehavior does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d) apply. \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(d) failure to follow prescribed treatment plans related to a diagnosed\npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability,\nreliability, or trustworthiness, including but not limited to, failure to take\nprescribed medication, or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant sought treatment from a medical group and was \ndiagnosed with anxiety in 2014 and a panic disorder in 2019. Other than those diagnoses \nthere is insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that Applicant exhibited behavior as \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndescribed in AG \u00b6 28(a) which casts doubt on his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 28(a) does not apply. \nThere is an opinion by a psychologist that Applicant met the criteria for alcohol use \ndisorder, mild, major depressive disorder, panic disorder, anxiety, and narcissist \npersonality traits. She opined that it would be unlikely that he would be able to safeguard \nsensitive information and that his judgment was poor. She opined that he appeared \ndeceptive and dishonest, putting his trustworthiness in question and his prognosis was \npoor. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies. There is no evidence that Applicant failed to follow prescribed \ntreatment or counseling. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nThe guideline includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \npsychological conditions. The following mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 29 was \nconsidered: \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \nApplicant was evaluated by Dr. B in November 2021. I have concerns about the \nquality and findings of the evaluation based on the 60-to-90-minute Zoom call that was \nrepeatedly interrupted due to technical difficulties and the lack of synchronized audio, \nwhereby Applicant had to use his telephone to complete the evaluation. Dr. B made no \nmention of these difficulties but commented on Applicant\u2019s lack of eye contact and other \nexternal factors that were beyond his control. Regardless, I have considered her \nevaluation. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s testimony and his wife\u2019s and found them \ncredible, particularly regarding his current abstinence and change in environment. There \nis sufficient evidence that Applicant had alcohol issues in the past that have been \naddressed under the Guideline G analysis. He also had anxiety and a panic disorder, \nwhich was treated with his primary care doctor\u2019s help. These were related to his job and \nissues with being separated from his children. Applicant has a new job, moved to a new \nstate, and his stress level has been reduced. Applicant presented sufficient evidence that \nthese issues are under control, and he has found methods to alleviate his stress. The last \ntime Applicant experienced significant anxiety was in 2019, almost three years ago. He \nhas a strong support group, including his wife. He has found relief through his \nwoodworking and other hobbies. He maintains a good relationship with his children. There \nis sufficient evidence that Applicant no longer has a current problem. I find AG \u00b6 28(e) \napplies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G and I in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant had issues with alcohol and addressed them. He has not had any \nalcohol-related incidents since 1995. He admitted himself into a detoxification program \nbecause he recognized he was consuming too much alcohol. He did not abstain from \nalcohol consumption but modified his drinking. He had a physical medical condition in \n2021, for which he used alcohol to help him with the pain and to sleep at night before he \nhad surgery. Once that condition was resolved, he again modified his consumption. In \n2022, his physician recommended that he completely abstain from consuming alcohol \nbased on his health issue. He is doing that. I considered all the evidence and believe \nApplicant has a clear appreciation for the problems his past alcohol consumption has had \nin his life and health, and the potential negative effect it could have on his employment. \nHe recognizes his stressors and has found outlets to alleviate those issues. I considered \nthe psychologist\u2019s evaluation, but found inconsistencies between objective information, \nsuch as the PAI, and subjective opinions. He does not have a perfect background, but \nthat is not the standard in analyzing eligibility for a security clearance. Based on all the \nevidence, I do not believe Applicant is a security risk. Applicant has met his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline G, alcohol consumption \nand Guideline I, psychological conditions. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted \nCarol G.

Her \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 49 years old. She and her husband have been married since \nNovember 2018. She has an adult son and an adult daughter. She earned an associate \ndegree in 2007. She has worked for various federal contractors in various government \ndepartments since at least 2007, and for her current employer since 2017.

(GE 1; Tr. 11, 37-38, 51-56) Her husband is a plumber. \nShe was unable to estimate his income and said they handle their finances separately. \n(Tr. 53-54) \nApplicant disclosed $25,000 in federal income tax debt on her September 2019 \nSCA. (GE 1 at 47) In her October 2019 background interview, she said her 2010 federal \ntaxes were audited in 2013 due to an error by a tax preparer. She then set up a payment \nplan of $389 a month. That amount was \u201creset\u201d in 2015, and she said she had been trying \nto restart a workable repayment plan. She also discussed other debts in her interview. \n(GE 5) \nApplicant explained that she had a small hair-braiding business in 2010 trying to \nmake extra money.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19.

The IRS challenged some of her deducted expenses, which led to an audit in \n2013. In later years, her tax issues continued because she was not having enough money \nwithheld from her pay. She has never really gotten on track, and now owes over $60,000 \nin past-due federal income taxes and over $20,000 in past-due state income taxes, for \nseveral years between 2010 and 2020. She failed to file her federal income tax returns \nfor TY 2019 on time, though these returns have now been filed (as has her 2019 state \nreturn, which was not alleged). AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) all apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has a long-history of past-due state and federal income tax debt. Her \ndebts are largely due at this point to failing to withhold enough income to address her \nyearly tax burden. This has gone on for several years, and she now owes more in past-\ndue federal income taxes (over $60,000) than what was alleged (about $52,000).

Significant federal tax \ndebt remains ongoing. She is not on a repayment plan and has made little to no effort to \naddress the problem even by paying the IRS what she can afford. She has outstanding \nstate tax debt as well (about $24,000 at this point, also more than what was alleged). She \nis on a repayment plan for those debts, but they are ongoing, are not isolated, and they \nand continue to cast doubt on her current judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s tax debts are largely due to her own failures \nto address them responsibility and not due to circumstances beyond her control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant has pursued financial advice from tax \npreparers and the IRS to address her long-term tax issues, but they are not being resolved \nand are not under control. \nApplicant has not demonstrated that she is acting in good faith. She has taken few \nconcrete steps to address her significant federal income tax debt. She is on a repayment \nplan for her state tax debts but this is not enough of a track record to show good-faith \ngiven her federal tax debts as well. She has filed her past-due state and federal tax returns \nfor TY 2019, but she had not filed her 2022 returns as of the date of the hearing. That tax \nyear is not alleged in the SOR, and I have not considered it as disqualifying conduct, but \nit undercuts her claims of rehabilitation and mitigation since her tax filing issues, too, are \nongoing. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) do not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.

Applicant owes about $80,000 in past-due state \nand federal income taxes. She has not provided enough evidence to show that she is \nacting responsibly in addressing these debts. She has not mitigated financial security \nconcerns. She has a long career as a federal contractor and is well regarded \nprofessionally. However, she has also had tax problems for much of this time. She is now \naddressing her state tax debt but has taken no recent steps to address her large, \noutstanding federal tax debt. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for access to classified information. She did \nnot mitigate financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for continued \naccess to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He earned an associate\u2019s degree in September 2009 \nand attended college in 2011. He has never been married and has one child (8 years old). \nHe has been employed by federal contractors in various information technology positions \nsince September 2015, and has worked for his current employer since March 2016. He \nwas unemployed from December 2014 to January 2015. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file, as required, federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2016 through 2018, and 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2017, 2018, and 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that he failed to pay, as required, \nhis Federal income taxes for tax year 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). (Item 1) In Applicant\u2019s answer to \nthe SOR, he admitted all SOR allegations with explanations. (Item 2) \nIn his August 2018 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant reported that\nhe forgot to file federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2017. (Item 3 at 40) \nDuring background interviews with a government investigator in September 2019, he said\nthat he had not filed federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018, \nand had not requested filing extensions. (Item 4 at 5) He said that he had attempted to\nfile his taxes in February 2019 \u201con the IRS website, but he got confused.\u201d He stated his\nintent to hire an accountant and to file the delinquent income tax returns. (Item 4 at 5 and\n6) During a September 18, 2020 interview, he reported that he had filed federal and state\nincome tax returns for tax years 2017 to 2019 in July 2020. The investigator told Applicant\nthat he had five days to provide tax account transcripts. (Item 4 at 7) During a September\n21, 2020 interview, Applicant reported that his online federal tax account transcript\nreflected that his 2018 income tax return had not been filed.

(Item 4 at 12-15) In his narrative response to inquiries, he reported that he had filed \nfederal income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2019; that he owed an unknown \namount for tax year 2014, and had \u201csetup a payment arrangement to get it paid.\u201d (Item 4 \nat 10-11) He reported that he had filed state income tax returns for tax years 2015 through \n2019, and that he had not filed state income tax returns for tax years 2020 and 2021, but \nplanned to do so.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a) He admitted \nthat he had not timely filed state income tax returns for tax years 2017, 2018 and 2020, \nclaimed that he had since filed returns for tax years 2017 and 2018, and said that he \nwould file his 2020 and 2021 returns.

(Item 2 \nat 6, 11, 13-15, 19, 21, 27, 29, 32-36, 40-42) \nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a net monthly salary \nof approximately $5,200, monthly expenses of approximately $1,500, and a net monthly \nremainder of approximately $3,641. (Item 4 at 22) He did not provide documentary \nevidence of his current financial budget, savings or expendable income. \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Dec. 19, 2002). \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the disqualifying \ncondition under this guideline in AG \u00b6 19(f) \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax as required.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant admitted that he failed to timely file and provided no documentary \nevidence that he filed federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2020, or a state \nincome tax return for tax year 2020. His claims that he filed federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2017 and 2018 are not fully corroborated by the documentary \nevidence he provided. He retained a tax preparer to prepare and file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for 2017 and 2018, and the tax preparer certified those returns were \nelectronically filed in July 2020, but Applicant\u2019s federal tax account transcripts dated in \nMarch 2022 show that no federal income tax returns were filed for tax years 2017 and \n2018. He also admitted that he failed to pay, as required, federal income taxes for tax \nyear 2014. He claimed that he had or would enter a payment arrangement with federal \ntax authorities to pay those delinquent taxes, but produced no documentary evidence that \nhe had done so. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file income tax returns \nand to pay annual income taxes due occurred frequently, is ongoing, and was not under \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s tax preparer\u2019s apparent failure to file his \nfederal income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018 were conditions largely beyond \nhis control. However, he has not acted responsibly. He did not begin to address his failure \nto file income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018 until July 2020, almost two years \nafter reporting his failure to file tax year 2017 returns in his SCA, and more than 10 months \nafter telling a Government investigator that he had not filed income tax returns for tax \nyears 2017 and 2018. And he has not reported or provided documentary evidence of any \naction he took after learning in September 2020, that his federal tax account transcript \nreflected no federal income tax return had been filed for tax year 2018.

Applicant claimed and presented \ndocumentary evidence that a tax preparer certified that in July 2020 he had electronically \nfiled delinquent income tax returns for two of the four tax years alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a (tax \nyears 2017 and 2018). However, he also provided tax account transcripts dated in March \n2022 that reflected no federal income tax returns had been filed for tax years 2016 through \n2018, and 2020. I find the documentary evidence insufficient to conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nincome tax returns were filed with federal tax authorities for tax years 2016 through 2018, \nand 2020. He also provided insufficient evidence that he paid or made arrangements to \npay delinquent tax year 2014 taxes. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-\nenforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. The fact that he attempted to file some past-due returns \u201cdoes not \npreclude careful consideration of [his] security worthiness based on longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, \n2014). \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is partially established for the delinquent state income tax returns. \nApplicant claimed and presented documentary evidence that a tax preparer prepared and \nfiled delinquent state income tax returns for two of the three tax years alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b (tax years 2017 and 2018), and that the tax preparer certified that those returns were \nfiled electronically in July 2020. However, he provided insufficient evidence that he filed \nhis tax year 2020 state income tax return. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered that Applicant is 37 years old, earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2009 \nand later attended college. I considered that he has been employed by federal contractors \nsince September 2015, has worked for his current employer since March 2016, and was \nunemployed from December 2014 to January 2015. However, he is responsible for \nensuring his federal and state income tax returns are timely filed and that income taxes \ndue are paid. He failed to file multiple federal and state income tax returns, failed to timely \nfile two state income tax returns, and failed to pay all taxes due. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to comply with the fundamental legal obligation to timely file \nincome tax returns and to pay his taxes raises significant security concerns. \u201cIndeed, the \nDirective cites failure to file returns as a disqualifying condition in and of itself, irrespective \nof whether the underlying taxes have actually been paid, as through withholding, etc.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-03019 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2017). \u201cA security clearance represents \nan obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets [and] failure \nto honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). \nAlthough there is some evidence in mitigation, Applicant failed to meet his burden \nof persuasion and the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to his \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On January 23, 2023, the case was assigned to \nme. I emailed Department Counsel and Applicant on February 16, 2023, to schedule the \nhearing. Both parties agreed to proceed with the hearing on March 8, 2023. On February \n24, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, \nsetting the hearing for March 8, 2023, using the Microsoft Teams video teleconference \nsystem.

He registered his business as a limited liability \ncorporation (LLC). He conducted his business for about ten years, except for about a two-\nyear period when he returned to work as an aircraft electrician. In 2016, Applicant and \nher husband began to experience financial problems due to borrowing lines of credit from \ntheir credit cards to finance his business. (Tr. 28-31, 57-58; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant is indebted to a credit union for a credit card account \ncharged off as a bad debt in the approximate amount of $29,146. She has never made a \npayment on this delinquent account. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 61-64; SOR response) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant is indebted to a bank for a credit card account charged \noff as a bad debt in the amount of $23,997. She testified that she had used this credit \ncard over the years. After it became delinquent, she never made a payment on this \naccount. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 61-64; SOR response) \nBoth accounts are joint credit card accounts that were opened in 1986. Applicant \nbecame aware that the accounts were delinquent in about April 2017. Her husband had \nbeen acting extremely stressed. After questioning him about his odd behavior, she \nlearned they were facing a large amount of delinquent debt due to him trying to cover the \nlosses from his unsuccessful day trading. (Tr. 34-37, 44-45; GE 2, GE 3 page 29 and 40; \nAE E) \nApplicant completed her SCA in February 2021, but she did not disclose any \nadverse financial information under Section 26 \u2013 Financial Record. In March 2021, during \nher background interview with a DOD authorized investigator, she was confronted about \nseveral delinquent financial accounts. She admitted that she and her husband had settled \none delinquent account with a credit card creditor before appearing in court. The other \noverdue accounts were related to her husband\u2019s failed business, and she had thought the \naccounts were closed and had \u201cdropped off\u201d the credit reports. She disclosed that she \nand her husband were currently involved in negotiations with the credit union creditor, as \nset forth in SOR subparagraph 1.a, above. (GE 1, GE 2; Tr. 39) \nIn September 2021, Applicant responded to financial interrogatories. She listed \nthat she and her husband were currently working with the credit bureaus to dispute any \nadverse financial information reported. In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, \nthe credit bureaus had 30 days to respond after receiving notice of the dispute. She listed \nthat when these delinquent accounts were successfully removed from their credit reports, \nshe would provide an updated statement of her credit standing. (GE 3 page 9; Tr. 37-38) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant admitted writing to the credit bureaus on multiple \noccasions. She provided a copy of a December 2021 letter she had sent to the credit \nreporting agencies with a total of 13 \u201cunverified accounts,\u201d that she demanded be \nremoved from her credit report.

She did not intend \nto initiate communication with these creditors because that would restart the seven-year \nperiod. She was unaware if a creditor had ever sent them a 1099-C, a cancellation of debt \nform, but she offered to check with her husband while the record was held open. She did \nnot submit documentation post-hearing as to whether they had received a 1099-C form \nfrom any of their delinquent creditors. (Tr. 41-43, 45-47; GE 3; AE H) \nApplicant provided a Personal Financial Statement (PFS) dated August 2021. After \ndeducting her monthly expenses and an additional $480 401(k) contribution from her \nmonthly pay, she had a net remainder of approximately $705. The PFS did not reflect any \npayment to her delinquent accounts. The PFS noted over $210,000 in a bank savings \naccount; money received from the sale of their house. She testified that she had not \nsought the assistance of a financial counseling program to resolve her indebtedness. \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted a new PFS that showed her total expenses \nexceeded her monthly income by $706, which did include monthly payments of $1,560 to \nthe two SOR debts. She also submitted documentation that showed if she paid a total of \n$1,300 monthly to these creditors through a consumer debt management program, she \nstill would not have enough income to make the payments in full. (GE 3 page 8; Tr. 43, \n49-53; AE B, AE F) \nDuring cross examination, Applicant admitted that possibly six other delinquent \ncredit accounts had dropped off their credit bureau report without being paid. She \nestimated that the amounts of these dropped-off debts were similar to the current debts \nof concern in this case, possibly a little lower than approximately $30,000 each. The only \ntwo charged-off accounts remaining on her credit report were the accounts referenced in \nthe SOR totaling approximately $53,000. She admitted that she had also received \ndocumentation from the credit bureaus in response to her letters of dispute. I asked her \nif she had any evidence to show that she was not legally responsible for the unpaid joint \naccounts with her spouse. She agreed she would provide a copy of her correspondence \nfrom the credit bureau(s) while the record was held open; however, this documentation \nwas not submitted. (Tr. 61-67) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant submitted several letters of appreciation from her employer, and two \ncharacter reference letters from her supervisor and the chief executive officer of the \ncompany. Both references reported that Applicant is regarded as an exceptional \nemployee, and she is eager to take on any challenge. \u201cShe approaches tasks with a \npositive attitude and has received favorable feedback from her customers, co-workers, \nand business associates.\u201d Both references endorsed Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for \na DOD security clearance.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts, as shown by credit reports in \nthe record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Aug. 10, 2018) (quoting ISCR Case No. 10-03656 at 3 (App. Bd. \nJan. 19, 2011) (internal citations omitted)), the Appeal Board stated: \nThe security significance of long delinquent debts is not diminished merely \nbecause the debts have become legally unenforceable owing to the \npassage of time.

A security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather a \nsecurity clearance adjudication is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to make a decision \nabout the applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable . . . , the federal government is entitled to \nconsider the facts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in \nincurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner. \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s past delinquent debts have been either charged off or may \nhave been dropped from her credit report or both. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off \nhis credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 \nat 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, \n2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items \nfrom a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming \ncollection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer. See Title \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit \nReporting Act Updates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-\nfair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute \nwhen creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond \nto a credit reporting company\u2019s request for information, or when the debt has been \ncharged off. \nApplicant holds her spouse responsible for the debts he created while trying to \nsupport his family through his failing business. She does not assert that her spouse \nfraudulently obtained money from their joint accounts. It is well-settled that both parties \nare legally responsible for debt repayment on joint accounts, even if only one incurred the \ndebt. She has not made an effort to responsibly repay the outstanding joint accounts she \nis legally responsible for despite the ample financial resources in her savings account that \ncould easily pay the debts in full. There is insufficient evidence to show that she \nparticipated in financial counseling. She has not established that her financial behavior is \nunlikely to recur or no longer casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c) do not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s attempt to refinance losses from his failed business is a \ncondition beyond her control and contributed to her financial problems. Thus, the first \nprong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide \nevidence that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant did not provide \na reasonable explanation as to why she was unable to make more progress addressing \nher delinquent accounts when she had the financial resources at her disposal. She has \nnot made an effort to arrange a payment plan with her creditors nor did she initiate contact \nwith the creditors. She is waiting for the charged-off accounts to either be removed from \nher credit report from the dispute, or to be dropped from her credit report in August 2023, \nthe end of the seven-year period. I find Applicant has not acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) do not apply. Under all of these circumstances, \nApplicant failed to establish that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 57 years old, and she has been employed by a federal contractor since \n2010. She is highly regarded as a committed and responsible employee at her place of \nemployment. I observed her demeanor during the hearing. There is no question in my \nmind that she is an exceptional employee providing outstanding service. \nApplicant did not establish why she was unable to make more significant progress \nin resolving her delinquent creditors, given that her August 2021 PFS documented a \nbalance of over $210,000 in a bank savings account. She did not initiate good-faith \npayment plans with any of her charged off creditors. Her actions demonstrate a lack of \nfiscal responsibility and good judgment, and raise unmitigated questions about her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort toward documented resolution of her past-due debt, she may well be \nable to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude \nthat financial consideration concerns are not mitigated. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv.

Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish a history of \nfinancial problems dating back to at least 2010. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Five potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully established. SOR \u00b6 1.r is concluded for Applicant because \nit happened more than nine years ago under circumstances unlikely to recur. His \ndelinquent student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j) and other delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k-1.m) \nhave been delinquent for some time, are ongoing, and cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment because \nof disability and other medical conditions were largely beyond his control. However, he \nhas not provided sufficient evidence that these conditions resulted in his financial \nproblems or that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling, or that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m are being resolved or are under \ncontrol. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. The record shows that Applicant resolved the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.q, 1.s, and 1.t.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance abuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to  comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana, LSD, and hallucinogenic mushrooms between 2013 \nand 2019, triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance abuse.\u201d The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 26: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstance that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of action to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nThe majority of Applicant\u2019s substance misuse occurred while he was in college. \nAlthough he has not used any illegal drugs in more than three years, the passage of time \nalone is not enough to mitigate the security concern. He has provided no evidence of \nmaturity, such as good job performance, positive character reference, or disassociation \nfrom drug-using associates that could alleviate doubt about reform and rehabilitation, nor \nhas he provided a signed statement explicitly expressing an intent to discontinue \nmarijuana. Nor has he established that he has developed an alternative method for dealing \nwith his anxiety. Under these circumstances, none of the mitigating conditions apply. I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the substance misuse security concern. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and \ncandid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified his 2018 application for a \nposition of trust. The omission of information from a security questionnaire, on its own, does \nnot establish an intentional falsification. The record must contain evidence of intent to \nmislead the Government. In this case, Applicant did not answer this allegation. I am \ntherefore unable to ascertain whether he admitted it, denied it, or whether the omission was \nan oversight. Moreover, there is no evidence on file that Applicant was ever confronted \nabout the omission on the public trust application. While the Government had a good-faith \nbasis for the allegation, it failed to carry its burden of production to establish an intentional \nfalsification. These facts, together with Applicant\u2019s full disclosure of his past drug use on a \n2021 security clearance application, lead me to conclude that there are no personal \nconduct security concerns. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

She timely submitted documentation, which I marked \nas AE C and admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a and denied SOR \u00b6 1.b. She is 38 years old, married, \nand she does not have any children. She graduated from high school in 2003. She has \nalso received several technical certifications. She has owned her home since July 2019. \nAs of the date of the hearing and since November 2022, she has worked as a business \nanalyst for her employer, a DOD contractor. She has never held a security clearance. \n(Answer; Tr. at 5, 12-13, 14-15, 29, 33, 41-44, 53; GE 1-2) \nApplicant lived in state A for 25 years until July 2019, when she moved to state B, \nwhere she currently resides. She has been taking medication prescribed by her \nneurologist for epilepsy since 2013. In 2015, she realized she was experiencing \ndepression symptoms and she sought the care of a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her with \ndepression. Under her psychiatrist\u2019s care, she took the maximum dose of a prescribed \nmedication to manage her depression symptoms. Although she felt \u201csomewhat better,\u201d \nher symptoms persisted. She consulted with her psychiatrist, who then wanted to switch \nher to a different medication. After researching online its possible detrimental side effects \non her health and the potential that it would make her depression worse, she elected not \nto switch her medication. She stated, \u201cthat was the only treatment option that my \npsychiatrist offered me,\u201d and she did not discuss with her psychiatrist the possibility of a \ndifferent treatment option or seek a second opinion. (Tr. at 13-14, 17-29, 30-32, 34, 46, \n49, 52-53; GE 1-3; AE B, C) \nApplicant researched the therapeutic benefits about the use of psilocybin \nmushrooms, a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act, to treat her \npersistent depression, and she decided to try it. She did not consult with her doctors about \nwhether it would have an adverse effect on her prescribed medications. She purchased \npsilocybin mushrooms from an individual who grew it, whom she met through an \nacquaintance. She orally consumed four grams on five occasions between August 2018 \nand April 2019, at her home, to self-treat her depression. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) This was the first \ntime she used illegal drugs, and she has not used any illegal drugs since then. She did \nnot inform her psychiatrist that she was self-medicating. She found that her use of \npsilocybin mushrooms significantly alleviated her symptoms, and she stopped taking \nthem because she felt better. During this period, she continued to take her prescribed \nmedications. When she moved to state B, her new psychiatrist reduced the amount of her \nprescribed medication, and she has found this dosage effective. Her spouse is aware of \nher use of psilocybin mushrooms. (Tr. at 13-14, 17-29, 30-32, 34-36, 39, 46-51, 53-54, \n56; GE 1-3; AE B, C) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed information about her use of psilocybin mushrooms on her \nNovember 2020 security clearance application (SCA) and during her March 2021 \nbackground interview. She stated on her SCA and indicated during her background \ninterview that she intended to continue to use psilocybin mushrooms in the future if her \nsymptoms returned. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) At the hearing, she clarified that she meant she would \nconsider using it under the care of her psychiatrist if it was legalized under federal and \nstate law. (Tr. at 13-14, 17-32, 36-40, 55-57; GE 1-3; AE B, C) \nApplicant is committed to seeking professional help with treating her depression in \nthe future. Unlike her psychiatrist in state A, her psychiatrist in state B discussed with her \nother treatment options that they could explore should her symptoms return or worsen. \nShe sees her psychiatrist and neurologist once every six months. She also has hobbies, \nto include yoga, gardening, and hiking, to help her cope with her depression. She stated \nthat she does not socialize with anyone involved with drugs. If she were to find herself in \na situation where illegal drugs are being used, she would leave. She intends to abide by \nher employer\u2019s policy against using illegal drugs. In April 2023, she signed a statement of \nintent to refrain from using any illegal substances, or abusing any legal substance, and \nthat any violation would result in her losing her security clearance. (Tr. at 27-31, 39-41, \n44-46, 54-55; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes the following applicable conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse . . . ; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant used psilocybin mushrooms from August 2018 to April 2019 to self-\nmedicate her depression symptoms. She previously stated that she intended to continue \nto use psilocybin mushrooms in the future if her symptoms returned. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), \nand 25(g) are established. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s use of psilocybin mushrooms occurred from August 2018 to April 2019, \nmore than four years ago. She disclosed information about her illegal drug use on her \nSCA and during her background interview, and she clarified at hearing that she would \nonly consider using it under the care of her psychiatrist if it was legalized under federal \nand state law. She testified that she did not socialize with individuals who use illegal \ndrugs, and she signed a statement of intent to abstain from all future drug involvement \nand substance misuse. The record evidence resolves doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. I found Applicant to be candid and credible at the hearing, \nand she has taken responsibility for her past drug use. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1), \nand 26(b)(3) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-\nperson analysis. I had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor during her \nhearing and found that she was credible and candid. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme without questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked for his current employer since about December 2019. He earned a high school diploma in 2006. He has taken some college courses but has not earned an undergraduate degree. He has been married since 2013. He has four children, two of whom are his stepchildren. Their ages are 17, 13, 9, and 5. He served in the U.S. Army from 2007 until 2014 and the Army Reserve from 2014 until 2018. He earned an honorable discharge from both. He has held a security clearance since 2007. He has never received a warning for a security clearance violation. (Tr. 19, 21-22; GE 1, 2) In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s six delinquent debts totaling approximately $47,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f). The delinquency listed in SOR \u00b6 1. a was an automobile loan. The remainder of the delinquencies were credit cards. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with additional comments. The delinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c are with the same creditor. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. (SOR; Answer) Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties started in about December 2017 when he lost his job because he would not agree to consecutive nine-month deployments away from his family. He made this decision after deliberating with his family and deciding he wanted to be with them more. He also did not want to miss the birth of his son.

He has worked \nfor his current employer since about December 2019. He earned a high school diploma \nin 2006. He has taken some college courses but has not earned an undergraduate \ndegree. He has been married since 2013. He has four children, two of whom are his \nstepchildren. Their ages are 17, 13, 9, and 5. He served in the U.S. Army from 2007 \nuntil 2014 and the Army Reserve from 2014 until 2018. He earned an honorable \ndischarge from both. He has held a security clearance since 2007. He has never \nreceived a warning for a security clearance violation. (Tr. 19, 21-22; GE 1, 2) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s six delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $47,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f). The delinquency listed in SOR \u00b6 1. a \nwas an automobile loan. The remainder of the delinquencies were credit cards. \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations with additional comments. The delinquencies in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c are with the same creditor. His admissions are adopted as \nfindings of fact. (SOR; Answer) \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties started in about December 2017 when he lost his \njob because he would not agree to consecutive nine-month deployments away from his \nfamily. He made this decision after deliberating with his family and deciding he wanted \nto be with them more. He also did not want to miss the birth of his son. He and his \nfamily then moved across the country from State A to State B, where his extended \nfamily lives. He was unemployed until about March 2018. (Tr. 26-28; Answer; GE 1, 2) \nWith the exception of the auto loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant incurred the \ndelinquent debt listed in the SOR through moving and living expenses. He could not \nafford to pay the SOR debts because he was unemployed. He claimed that he \ncontacted the SOR creditors in 2017 or 2018, to make payment arrangements with \nthem when he lost his job, but they wanted more money than he could afford while he \nwas unemployed. He contacted the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e in August 2022 \nand made payment arrangements with them. He provided documents corroborating his \n$400 monthly payment to the creditor of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c in \nNovember and December 2022, and January 2023. He provided documents \ncorroborating his monthly payments of $135 to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d in November \nand December 2022, and January 2023. He provided a document corroborating that he \nhas a zero balance on the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He paid this debt off in August \n2022. He contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f in April 2022 and arranged for a $50 \nautomatic debit from his bank account in December 2022. He has a payment \narrangement with this creditor, as well. All of the SOR debts have been resolved or are \nin the process of being resolved. He acknowledged that the possible loss of his security \nclearance motivated him to resolve the SOR debts. (Tr. 19, 25-33; Answer; GE 1, 2, 5-\n8; AE A-E)  \nApplicant claimed that in March 2021, he sold a home and paid off all of his credit \ncards with the exception of the debts listed in the SOR.

In September 2022, he \nfinanced the purchase of a truck for $86,000, on which he pays about $1,550 per \nmonth. In March 2022, he financed the purchase of a recreational vehicle (RV) for \n$58,000 on which he pays about $918 per month. He purchased this RV because he \nwas living in a smaller one and wanted more room for his family. He and his family have \nsince moved out of the RV into a home for which he pays rent of about $1,500 per \nmonth. In January 2023, his father and cousin passed away, and he used credit to pay \nsome of the related expenses, including helping his mother financially. While they carry \na balance, none of these non-SOR credit cards, lines of credit, or retail installment \ncontracts are delinquent. (Tr. 34-40; GE 2, 8) \nWhen Applicant left the military in 2018, he was classified as 40 percent \ndisabled. After making additional claims with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), \nhis disability increased to 60 percent and then to 100 percent in March 2022. In April \n2022, he received a lump-sum payment from the VA for about $5,000 for retroactive \ndisability benefits. That same month, he began receiving about $4,280 in tax-free \ndisability payments. At this time, his wife also began receiving about $1,100 for an \neducational stipend. Applicant claimed that this influx of about $5,000 in additional \nmonthly income helped him pay his bills and allowed him to make payment \narrangement on the SOR debts. Applicant earns $5,900 per month in take-home salary \nand his wife receives $1,000 per month for child support for his two stepchildren. He \nprovided a copy of his working budget that shows a monthly surplus of about $2,000. \nHe has about $100 in a savings account and $2,000 in cash, so his actual savings do \nnot match his written budget. (Tr. 31-34, 41-45; AE D) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had six delinquent debts totaling about $47,000 that were delinquent \nfor several years. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), thereby \nshifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nDespite beginning to resolve his SOR debts through payment, Applicant only \nbegan making these payments in August 2022, at the earliest. There has been an \ninsufficient amount of time in which he has been addressing these debts. The \ncircumstance that led to his delinquencies (unemployment) ended several years ago, \nyet Applicant did not address these debts for years. He incurred additional, unnecessary \ndebt, before addressing his delinquent debts. Given the surplus in his budget, he cannot \naccount for where he spends his money. Under these circumstances, I cannot yet find \nthat he has established a track record of financial responsibility or that his financial \nissues are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose because he lost his job in late 2017, after he \nwould not agree to a deployment. While he knowingly and voluntarily made the decision \nthat resulted in his being laid off, given the circumstances of consecutive deployments \naway from his family, I will give him the benefit of the doubt and consider it to have \nresulted from conditions beyond his control. However, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, he must \nalso show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to these \ndebts. The reason he gave for his financial difficulties, his unemployment, ended in \nMarch 2018. He provided no evidence why it took him over four years to address the \nSOR debts. Instead of addressing his delinquent debts, he incurred significant, \nadditional consumer debt in the form of high-priced vehicles and credit cards. Despite \nhis claim that he has about $2,000 in surplus income each month, he only pays about \n$585 per month on his significant SOR debts. Given these considerations, he has failed \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances and AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \napply. \nApplicant made arrangements to pay his delinquent debts after the SOR was \nissued. He acknowledged that concern for his security clearance was what motivated \nhim to do so. His unemployment ended as of March 2018, and he failed to show why he \ncould not make payment arrangements prior to August 2022. An applicant who begins \nto resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her \nclearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and \nregulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). While he made an effort to repay his \ncreditors, given its timing, he has not made this effort in good faith. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not \napply. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant\u2019s financial issues \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my \nwhole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The Government offered Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 , which were \nadmitted without objection, and Hearing Exhibits (HX) 1 and 2 for Administrative Notice. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf. Applicant offered 14 documents, which I marked \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through N. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(TR) soon thereafter. \nProcedural Rulings \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to The Russian Federation and to the State of Israel. Department Counsel \nprovided an 11-page summary of the facts, supported by 23 Government documents \npertaining to Russia, identified as HX 1. Department Counsel provided a 7-page \nsummary of the facts, supported by 12 Government documents pertaining to Israel, \nidentified as HX 2. Applicant\u2019s Counsel also supplemented the Government\u2019s \ndocuments as to Israel, supported by 13 Applicant documents. The documents provide \nelaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts \nincluded in the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general \nknowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, through 1.g. He denied SOR \nallegation \u00b6 1.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old and is employed by a defense contractor, as \u201ca \nPhysicist.\u201d He has worked for the defense contractor since October of 2017. He is \ndivorced and has twine boys by his former marriage. He also has one female child, by \nhis cohabitant. (TR at page 16 line 4 to page 19 line 4, at page 38 line 7 to page 39 line \n3, and GX 1 at pages 7, 21, 29, 31 and 37~38.) \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n1.a., 1.f. and 1.g. Applicant\u2019s cohabitant is a naturalized U.S. citizen, as \nevidenced by a naturalization certificate. (TR at page 19 line 5 to page 20 line 18, and \nAppX E.) A graduate from an American law school, she has been practicing law since \n2021. (AppX N.) Applicant\u2019s cohabitant owns a studio apartment on the outskirts of \nMoscow worth about $90,000, which she is trying to sell. Her annual salary is between \n$80,000~$90,000. She is not reliant on Applicant for financial support. (TR at page 24 \nline 23 to page 28 line 4, at page 34 line 18 to page 35 line 15, at page 39 lines 19~24, \nand AppX N.) \n1.e. Applicant\u2019s 17-year-old twin boys are dual national of Russia and the United \nStates, and live in New Jersey with their mother, Applicant\u2019s former spouse. He sees \nthem \u201cat least once a month,\u201d except in the summer, when they \u201cspend a month or two\u201d \nwith their father. (TR at page 37 lines 9~21, at page 40 line 23 to page 41 line 2, and \nGX 1 at pages 37~38.) His five-year-old American daughter lives with Applicant and his \ncohabitant.

Applicant\u2019s elderly, retired parents are citizens and residents of Russia. \nThey are actively trying to emigrate to Israel, to be close to Applicants\u2019 sister who is a \ncitizen and resident of Israel, not of Russia as is alleged. Her husband works \u201cfor a \nU.S.-based company.\u201d They have no connection with the Israeli government. (TR at \npage 23 line 1 to page 24 line 12, at page 31 lines 1~6, and AppX j.) \nAdministrative Notice \nI take Administrative Notice of the following facts about Russia: The Russian \nFederation has a highly centralized authoritarian political system dominated by \nPresident Vladimir Putin. Russia violated Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity in \n2014 and 2022. Russia presents one of the most serious foreign threats to the United \nStates. \nI take Administrative Notice of the following facts about Israel: The State of Israel \nis a multi-parliamentary democracy. The U.S. Department of State has issued travel \nadvisories for Israel. Jerusalem and Tel Aviv have been assessed as HIGH-threat \nlocations for terrorism. However, Israel has been the United States\u2019 closest ally in the \nMiddle East since it was founded in 1948. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s cohabitant was a citizen of Russia and still owns property there, his \nparents still live in Russia, and he has a sister who is a citizen of and resides in Israel. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant\u2019s cohabitant is now a U.S. citizen. All three of his children are \nAmericans, and reside in the United States. His youngest daughter is native born. \nApplicant\u2019s parents are elderly and retired. His sister lives in Israel, but her husband \nworks for an American company. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 8 has been established. \nForeign Influence is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \na distinguished history of working in the defense industry and is respected in the \nworkplace. He performs well at his job. (AppXs B~D.) While he was born in Russia, he \nis an American by choice. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the United States due to his longstanding ties here. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign \nInfluence security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~.1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

He \nattributed the problems to \u201c[u]nexpected medical bills along with increased mortgage \nand utilities.\u201d He and his wife bought a new home in 2013. The costs associated with \nhome ownership, such as maintenance, repairs, and utilities, were more than he \nexpected. In about 2016, they decided that they could not pay their mortgage and their \ncredit cards, and they stopped paying their credit cards. He also did not pay his student \nloans. (Tr. at 16-18, 23-24; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent consumer debts totaling about $14,445 and \nnine defaulted student loans totaling about $35,650. The debts are established through \ncredit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were transferred to a new servicer to collect the loans \nin about 2019. He started making $450 payments in December 2019, which was broken \ndown into individual loans. From December 2019 through June 2020, he made nine \n$450 payments ($4,050). The loans were then considered rehabilitated and current, and \nthey were transferred back to the original servicer. His federal student loan payments \nwere then paused pursuant to COVID-19 relief. The pause was extended several times. \nIt is currently extended through at least June 2023. (Tr. at 25, 32, 41-42; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 3-6; AE A-C, E, 1, 2) \nApplicant settled and paid four of the alleged consumer debts. He settled an \n$855 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h) for $770 in January 2023; a $1,022 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) for $766 in \nFebruary 2023; a $2,090 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) for $1,671 in March 2023; and a $940 debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g) for $658 in March 2023. (Tr. at 30-32; GE 3-6; AE D, J, K, 1, 5(a)-7(b)) \nApplicant\u2019s finances have improved since he obtained his current job in 2017. He \nand his wife continued to pay their secured loans (mortgage, auto). They built up an \nemergency fund. As he progressed and received raises, he started paying his student \nloans and other debts. He paid a $4,734 credit card debt that was not alleged in the \nSOR and at least one debt that was in his wife\u2019s name. He studied the advice of noted \nfinancial expert Dave Ramsey and is using his \u201csnowball\u201d method of paying the smallest \ndebt first, and then moving on to the next smallest debt. His current salary is about \n$105,000 a year, and his wife earns about $60,000 as a teacher. He credibly testified \nthat he intends to pay the remaining delinquent debts and his student loans when they \ncome out of the pause. He is committed to obtaining and maintaining financial stability. \n(Tr. at 18, 22-23, 30-41, 44-46; GE 2-6; AE F-I) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted student loans \nand delinquent consumer debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to \u201c[u]nexpected medical bills along \nwith increased mortgage and utilities.\u201d He and his wife bought a new home in 2013. The \ncosts associated with home ownership, such as maintenance, repairs, and utilities, were \nmore than he expected. The costs of home ownership were not beyond his control. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s finances improved after he obtained his current job and earned \nraises. He started paying his debts long before the SOR was issued. He paid $4,050 \nbetween December 2019 and June 2020 to rehabilitate his student loans. He paid a \n$4,734 credit card debt that was not alleged in the SOR and at least one other debt that \nwas in his wife\u2019s name. He settled four of the delinquent consumer debts. He has about \n$9,500 of delinquent debts still to be addressed. He credibly testified that he intends to \npay the remaining delinquent debts and his student loans when they come out of the \npause. He is committed to obtaining and maintaining financial stability. \nApplicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, but perfection is not required. A security \nclearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a procedure designed to \nevaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to \nestablish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish \na plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions to implement the \nplan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts \nsimultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid \nfirst. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant established that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and \nhe took significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances and made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His finances do not cast \ndoubt on his current judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.q: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

He admitted SOR \nallegation \u00b6 1.d. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since May of 2007. He has held a security \nclearance since June of 2007. He is divorced and has two minor children. (TR at page \n11 line 24 to page 13 line 6, and GX 1 at pages 7, 14, 19~20, 22~23 and 42.) Applicant \nattributes some of his alleged financial difficulties to his former spouse, from whom he \nwas divorced from in July of 2020. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to three creditors totaling in excess of \n$65,000. It also alleges that Applicant filed for the protection of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy \nin 2016. \n1.d. Applicant admits that he filed for the protection of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in \n2016, and that his debts were subsequently discharged by said bankruptcy. (TR at page \n19 lines 3~23, and GX 2.) \n1.a. Applicant denies that he has a past-due debt to Creditor A in the amount of \nabout $48,000. He admits to a $22,000 past-due debt, which he began to address in \nJune of 2022 (AppX L) and made his first monthly payment of $457 towards in August \n2022 (AppX N), only a week prior to his hearing. (TR at page 13 line 16 to page 15 line \n24, and at page 25 line 14 to page 28 line 17.) I find Applicant\u2019s response to this \nsignificant past-due debt to be too little, too late. From his testimony it is clear he was \naware of this debt, but only began to address it about four months after the issuance of \nthe SOR. (AppX L.) This allegation is found against Applicant. \n1.b. Applicant denies that he has a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of \nabout $16,000. His former spouse had agreed to pay this motor vehicle loan; and as \nsuch, Applicant was unaware of this past-due debt until he received the SOR. (TR at \npage 15 line 22 to page 17 line 15.) He has satisfied this debt prior to his hearing, as \nevidenced by documentation. (AppXs J, K and M.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n1.c. Applicant denies any knowledge of a past-due medical debt of about $1,874. \n(TR at page 17 line 16 to page 19 line 2.)

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties can, in part, be attributed to his divorce, \nhe has only recently begun to address his most significant past-due debt. This is not \ndue diligence on Applicant\u2019s part. Applicant has not demonstrated that future financial \nproblems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nrespected in the workplace. He performs well at his job. (AppXs C and D.) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in August 2012 and was \nhonorably discharged in August 2016. From August 2016 to 2020, he was a member of \nthe Navy Individual Ready Reserve (IRR).

(Tr. 20-22, 27, 42; GE 1) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \n2009 to about May 2020. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that he purchased marijuana during 2009 \nuntil about May 2020. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e allege that he used and purchased marijuana \nfrom September 2016 to May 2020, while granted eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

(1) from 2009 to 2012, he used marijuana recreationally in high school \nuntil his junior year of college; (2) from 2012 to 2016, while serving in the U.S. Navy, he \ndid not use marijuana at all; (3) after his August 2016 discharge from the Navy, he \noccasionally used marijuana recreationally with friends until May 2020; and (4) from May \n2020 to the date of the hearing, he had not used any illegal substance. (Tr. 22-42) \nApplicant explained why he resumed his use of marijuana after his 2016 discharge \nfrom the U.S. Navy. He was adjusting to life as a civilian, he was back with his hometown \nfriends, and marijuana was legal under state law where he lived. He was employed part-\ntime by a car dealership, he attended college classes, and he was a member of the IRR. \nHis involvement in the IRR was an unpaid position, he did not report to any military \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncommander or installation or drill, he did not wear his uniform, and he was unaware during \nthat time that he had been granted security clearance eligibility in the event he received \norders to mobilize.

He stated that he has matured and has no intention of using marijuana again. \nApplicant provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility. See AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), infra. He created strict \nboundaries with his girlfriend, friends, and family members, letting them know that he will \nnot tolerate anyone using illegal drugs in his presence. He has also agreed to allow his \nemployer to conduct multiple drug tests to confirm his compliance. (Tr. 22-42; AE G) \nIn May 2023, Applicant participated in a substance abuse evaluation with a \nsubstance abuse and mental health professional. He denied any previous substance \nabuse treatment, positive drug tests, or drug-related criminal charges. He was diagnosed \nwith depression in 2018. He takes prescribed medication daily and denied any current \ndepression or anxiety. Applicant took several administered tests used in the industry to \nassess whether he had a substance abuse disorder. The results showed that Applicant \ndid not meet the criteria set forth by the American Psychiatric Association for an active \ncannabis abuse disorder. His final diagnosis was cannabis use disorder \u2013 mild \u2013 in \nsustained remission. He was not referred for further treatment or counseling. (AE F; Tr. \n44-45) \nPersonal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant falsified his marijuana use on the April 2012 SCA, \nwhen he denied that he had used any illegal or controlled substance within the last seven \nyears. Applicant stated that his recruiter convinced him to omit his marijuana usage when \nhe completed the SCA at the age of 20. The recruiter gave him the impression that \nApplicant would not be able to enlist into the U.S. Navy if he disclosed his prior use of \nmarijuana, so he followed his recruiter\u2019s advice. When Applicant completed his SCA in \nSeptember 2020, he was more mature and understood the importance of truthfulness. \nHe fully disclosed his past use of marijuana on his 2020 SCA and throughout his 2020 \nsecurity investigation.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);\u201d \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . . .;\u201d and \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while\u2026holding a \nsensitive position.\u201d The record and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), \nand 25(f). \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b). \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. See Drug \nEnforcement Administration listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/\n1308 11.htm\n \n. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of \nmarijuana on Schedule I). \nThe Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications as follows: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation.

Feb. 1, 2022)). \nApplicant used marijuana recreationally from 2009 to 2012 and from after his \nAugust 2016 discharge from the Navy until his May 2020 college graduation. He resumed \nmarijuana use after his 2016 honorable discharge because he returned to his hometown \nfriends, his state of residence had legalized the use of marijuana, and he was adjusting \nto life as a civilian. He was unaware while he was a member of the IRR that he held \nsecurity clearance eligibility in the event he received orders to mobilize. Since May 2020, \nhe has matured, started a promising career with his current employer, and no longer \ndesires to use marijuana in the future. \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He voluntarily disclosed \nhis marijuana possession and use during the 2020 security clearance process. He \ndisclosed his marijuana use on his 2020 SCA, in his SOR response, and during his \nhearing. He provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, and he acknowledged that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. He also participated in a substance \nabuse evaluation in May 2023, and he received a favorable diagnosis. \nApplicant is a valued employee and a trustworthy friend, and he testified credibly \nduring the hearing. I am convinced his marijuana possession and use \u201chappened under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur [and] does not cast doubt on [his] current \nreliability, trustworthiness, [and] good judgment.\u201d Guideline H security concerns are \nmitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 describes the security concern about personal conduct as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.

Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant falsified his marijuana use on his April 2012 SCA \nwhen he denied any illegal drug use within the last seven years. He was 20 years old, \nand his recruiter advised him to omit his marijuana usage or else he may not be \nconsidered a suitable candidate for enlistment into the U.S. Navy. \nAlthough Applicant failed to honestly and candidly disclose derogatory information \non his April 2012 SCA, it is important to note he was completely forthright about his \nmarijuana usage when he completed his second SCA in September 2020. Applicant \nlearned the importance of truthfulness while serving four years in the Navy, and he \nacknowledged his personal growth and maturity. He consistently reported his marijuana \nuse and purchase throughout his 2020 security investigation and during the hearing. I find \nthat when he was 20 years old and easily influenced, he relied on bad advice from his \nrecruiter. More than a decade has passed since that incident, and it happened under such \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.

Personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant discussed his history of involvement with marijuana on his September \n2020 SCA, in his SOR response, and at his hearing. He did not test positive on a urinalysis \ntest, he has never been treated for a substance abuse disorder, and he does not have \nany drug-related arrests. He stopped using marijuana over three years ago and promised \nnot to use marijuana in the future. His testimony was credible and candid. \nAn honest and candid self-report of marijuana use is an important indication that, \nif granted security clearance eligibility, the individual would disclose any threats to \nnational security, even if the disclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her \nown career or personal reputation. However, to receive full credit, the self-report must be \naccurate, and I have found Applicant\u2019s accounting sincere. I have carefully applied the \nlaw, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant \nhas mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse and personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 29 years old. He earned an associate degree in 2014 and a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2016. He has never married and has no children. After graduating college, he \nworked part-time until he found full-time employment in October 2017. His annual salary \nwas about $30,000 to $34,000. In February 2019, he began working for his present \nemployer and earns about $54,000 annually. He also works a part-time job five days a \nweek, three hours a day, earning $13.00 an hour. (Tr. 16-20; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in 2018 and another \nin January 2021. He did not disclose any delinquent debts or loans on his 2021 SCA. He \nwas interviewed by a government investigator in February 2021. He did not voluntarily \ndisclose he had delinquent student loans until confronted with them by the investigator. \nHe told the investigator that he was unaware they were in collection. He said he would \ncontact the creditor and make payment arrangements. (GE 1, 2) \nApplicant credibly testified that when he completed the SCA he believed that the \nfinancial section that inquired about delinquent debts was referring to mortgages, car \nloans, and other consumer debts. He did not associate his student loan as being in the \nsame category. He did not ask for assistance or clarification about the questions being \nasked. He testified that he did not intentionally fail to disclose the student loans and other \ndebt alleged in the SOR in his SCA. (Tr. 21-26) \nApplicant financed his education with student loans and grants. He testified that \nhe did not remember how he received his student loans, because he was playing a sport \nat college, but confirmed the loans were used to pay for college. He was confused about \nhow he obtained the loans. The student loans are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j and \ntotal approximately $55,904. He testified that he contacted the creditor in about 2017 \nabout repaying the loans. The creditor advised him to pay $128 a month. Applicant could \nnot afford to pay that amount at the time. He did not contact the creditor again. Applicant\u2019s \nstudent loans are now deferred due to the pandemic. (Tr. 21-26, 40-59; GE 3-7) \nApplicant made one payment of $128 in approximately May 2019. He could not \nrecall why he made that payment but assumed it was because he had some extra money. \nHe testified that he looked at his Credit Karma statement and the student loan accounts \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwere reported as closed. He believed because they were closed, he was no longer \nresponsible for paying them and did not need to disclose them on his SCA. He further \ntestified that after he received the SOR, he believed that at his hearing he would be \nprovided financial guidance in formulating a payment plan to resolve his delinquent \nstudent loans. He said he never thought to contact the creditor to make a payment \narrangement after his initial inquiry or to inquire about the status of the loans. He never \nthought to ask his facility security officer or anyone else for help in understanding how to \nresolve the issues raised. He said he did not understand that his student loans were \nconsidered debts. (Tr. 21-29, 44-59) \nThe SOR alleges a small debt (\u00b6 1.k - $48) that Applicant said he was unaware of. \nHe has not contacted the creditor or made attempts to resolve this debt. Again, he \nbelieved he would be provided financial guidance at his hearing on how to resolve the \nfinancial issues raised. (Tr. 28-29, 53; GE 3-7) \nApplicant testified that he pays his bills on time. Six months ago, he started a \nbudget to keep track of his expenses and payments. He has about $30 in his bank \naccount. He estimated that he spends about $300-$400 on non-essential expenses, such \nas restaurants, dates, and playing golf about once a month ($60 green fees). He has not \nreceived any financial counseling. After the record closed, Applicant provided a receipt to \nshow he made a payment of $150 toward his student loan. (Tr. 30-40, 59-61; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent student \nloans and another debt. I believe he was aware he had student loans, and he had not \npaid them, but he did not think he had to disclose them on his SCA. He believed the debts \nthat were required to be reported were mortgages, car loans, and other consumer debts. \nApplicant\u2019s naivety was apparent throughout his hearing. I found him credible. I do not \nbelieve he deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent student loans. I believe he was \nunaware of the other debt alleged in the SOR. The above disqualifying condition does not \napply. I Applicant refuted the personal conduct allegation. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant graduated from college in 2016. He financed his education with student \nloans. He made one payment before receiving the SOR and another post-hearing. He \nhas not contacted the creditor to resolve the loans or debt and does not have a plan on \nhow he will resolve them. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant testified that he was unable to make the proposed payment amount \nprovided by the creditor for his student loans. He assumed because Credit Karma \nindicated the loan accounts were closed that he no longer had to pay them. He did not \ncontact the creditor to verify the status of the accounts or seek guidance on their status. \nApplicant certainly became aware after his background interview and receipt of the SOR \nthat his student loans were a security concern. He made one pre-hearing payment and \nanother post-hearing payment. He did not take any other action to address them or the \nother small debt alleged in the SOR. For some reason, he thought the security clearance \nhearing process would assist him with guidance on how to resolve his financial difficulties. \nHe has not had financial counseling. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E and Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nIt was clear Applicant was overwhelmed by his responsibility for repaying his \nstudent loans. Although he was naive in believing he would be provided financial \nguidance at his hearing, he had contacted the creditor earlier to make a payment plan \neven though he could not afford it. His belief that, because the accounts were closed, he \nno longer owed the debts raises concerns about his judgment. Equally concerning is that \nhe did not take the initiative to inquire and learn what his current obligations were to repay \nhis loans. His conduct raises questions about his ability to protect classified information. \nHe has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious \nquestions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. The security concerns under Guideline E, personal \nconduct were refuted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial consideration concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 14, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing reasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DCSA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec.

At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of eight exhibits. (GEs 1-8) \nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits.

Allegedly, these debts have not been \nresolved and remain outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the alleged SOR debts that \nwere either charged off or in collection. He claimed his student loans payment \nobligations have been suspended by Federal mandate. He claimed he will pay off his \ndelinquent medical and consumer debts by August 2022. Applicant also claimed that his \nhousehold finances have improved and cited his wife\u2019s current employment and \n$72,000 annual salary as a major factor.

(GEs 6-8; Tr. 22, 24) Currently, his student \nloans are in the Government\u2019s forgiveness program, during which time enforcement of \ncollections is suspended. (Tr. 16) While Applicant\u2019s DoE-guaranteed student loans are \ncurrently deferred, he has done nothing to rehabilitate his loans, either before or after \nhis loans were placed in deferred status. (GEs 3-5) While income-based repayment \nplans with DOE were always an option for him to pursue with the DoE, he apparently \nnever explored any payment options that could potentially accommodate his limited \nresources following his college graduation. \nAssessing Applicant\u2019s delinquent medical and consumer accounts, he has made \nno documented progress in addressing any of these accounts. (GEs 4-8; Tr. 24-25) He \nattributed his failures to address his debts to treating them mostly \u201cas out of sight, out of \nmind.\u201d (Tr. 25) In the past, he has generally relied on his wife to handle his finances and \nfailed to properly monitor his accounts.

(Tr. 26-27) His \nmonthly expenses include his mortgage, food, utilities, his wife\u2019s car loan, and monthly \ntithing to his church. (Tr. 26) Currently, Applicant and his wife are running a monthly \ndeficit of $4,000. (Tr. 27) They hold around $4,500 in cash assets and a little more than \n$10,000 in interest savings. (Tr. 27-28) \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  .

Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

These \ncollective debt delinquencies warrant the application of three of the disqualifying \nconditions (DC) of the financial considerations guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; \nand 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts with explanations require no independent \nproof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \n\u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006).

While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited explanations for his debt delinquencies are insufficient to \nwarrant the application of any of the potentially available mitigating conditions. \nEnforcement suspension of Applicant\u2019s delinquent student loan debts (by far his largest \ndelinquent accounts) does not mitigate the pre-suspension delinquent status of his \nloans, and he has made no documented efforts to rehabilitate his loans before the \nenforcement pause went into effect in 2020. Currently, he has no financial plan in place \nto aid him in mitigating the Government\u2019s financial concerns. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). Based on the \nevidence presented, Applicant is not able to demonstrate a sufficient tangible track \nrecord of actual debt reduction to satisfy Appeal Board guidance. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions and \nhis explanations as to why he has not been able to address his delinquent student loan \nand other debts to date, insufficient evidence has been presented to enable him to \nmaintain sufficient control of his finances to meet minimum standards for holding a \nsecurity clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

This debt remains \nunresolved. (Item 7) \nIn his Answer, Applicant asserted that his monthly income exceeds his monthly \nobligations. A budget submitted in 2021 shows that he has about $10,000 of excess \nmonthly income. He claimed that he does not live lavishly and that he expects to be totally \ndebt free by mid-2023. He asserted that he is not a risk to national security and could not \nbe compromised through financial inducements or blackmail to reveal classified \ninformation. (Answer, Item 6) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe Appeal Board held in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed towards inducing an applicant to file \ntax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR allegations of Applicant\u2019s failure to file federal and state income tax \nreturns, and unpaid federal and state tax debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, \nhis 2021 SCA, background interview, response to interrogatories, and the court record. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.

Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing \nthat his unfiled income tax returns or tax debts occurred largely due to circumstances \nbeyond his control or that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. Applicant has at least three years of unfiled federal \nincome tax returns, two years of unfiled state income tax returns, and federal and state \ntax debts. He has known about his tax issues for several years, and he has not made any \ndocumented effort to resolve them. In his Answer, he claimed that he has made some \npayments on his tax debts, and that he had filed his 2018 returns, but he provided no \ndocumentary evidence of those actions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of his unfiled federal and \nstate income tax returns, and his delinquent federal and state tax debts under Guideline \nF. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.
