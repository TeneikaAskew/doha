On November 19, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 21, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred in his application of the\npertinent mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous.1\nFinding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant, an employee of a defense contractor, had acquired nearly\n$15,000 in delinquent debt since 2004.  The debts were for such things as telephone services,\ngroceries, and a breached rental agreement.  The Judge found that the debts were caused in large\nmeasure by Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s unemployment.  However, he also concluded that Applicant had\nnot demonstrated that her financial problems were being resolved or were under control.  \nThe Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d)   After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the\nJudge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle\nMfrs.

Clearance is\ndenied.\nOn November 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines F, financial considerations, and E, personal conduct. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 3, 2009, admitting all of the allegations\nexcept subparagraph 1.b, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on\nFebruary 10, 2009. On March 9, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the\nMay 21, 2009\n\nISCR Case No. 03-07826 (App. Board June 17, 2005 at 3).\n1\n2\ncase for April 3, 2009. It was held as scheduled. At the hearing, I received eight\ngovernment exhibits, five Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At the hearing\u2019s\nconclusion, I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s request so that she could submit\nadditional exhibits. Within the allotted time, she submitted eight additional exhibits that I\nincorporated into the record. The transcript was received on April 10, 2009.\nProcedural Ruling\nSOR subparagraph 1.a alleges that Applicant is \u201cindebted to a medical provider\nin the approximate amount of $50, for a delinquent account referred for collection in\nabout 2004.\u201d This allegation is overbroad because it does not identify a specific creditor.\nAlthough an SOR does not have to satisfy the strict requirements of a criminal\nindictment, it must still place an applicant on adequate notice of the allegations so that\nshe may have a reasonable opportunity to respond and prepare a defense.1\nSubparagraph 1.a. does not meet this minimum threshold, therefore, I conclude that it is\nnot justiciable.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 32-year-old woman with two children, ages seven and five. She\nhas been married for eight years. She has an undergraduate degree in criminal justice,\nand a master\u2019s degree in business administration. She has been supporting herself\nsince her mother\u2019s death, which occurred when Applicant was 15 years old (Exhibit B).\nWhile in college, she helped her grandmother support her two younger siblings by\nworking two part-time jobs (Id.). \nCurrently, Applicant works for a defense contractor as a program manager in the\nfield of contract procurement (Tr. 29). She is highly respected on the job. In the two\nyears since she began working for her employer, she has risen to the level of team\nleader (Exhibit A). Her contribution to the government agency that her team supports\nhas been invaluable (Id.). She was recently promoted (Tr. 92).\nSince 2004, Applicant has accrued approximately $15,100 of delinquent debt,\nincluding six phone bills (SOR subparagraphs 1c, 1.e, 1.g - 1.j), three utilities (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.k - 1.m), two automobile - related debts (1.d, 1.f), and an apartment\nrental delinquency (SOR subparagraph 1.n). She attributes her inability to make ends\nmeet to her husband\u2019s unsteady employment (Tr. 118). He is currently unemployed, and\nhas been unemployed four of the past six years (Tr. 119).\nSOR subparagraph 1.b alleges a delinquency owed to the collection agent for a\ngrocery store where Applicant allegedly wrote a bounced check. Applicant denies this\nallegation. This debt is listed in a 2007 credit report (Exhibit 5 at 14). Applicant alleged\nshe contacted the creditor, but provided no supporting documentary evidence. I find\nApplicant owes this creditor as alleged in the SOR, and that it remains outstanding.\n\n3\nApplicant accrued the phone bill listed in SOR subparagraph 1.c in approximately\n2004 (Tr. 53). She contends that when she contacted the creditor to make payment\narrangements, the creditor informed her it was no longer pursuing payment because the\ndelinquency had been charged off (Tr. 53). Applicant provided no evidence\ndocumenting her contact with this creditor.\nThe debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.d accrued when the property\nmanagement company of Applicant\u2019s then-residence towed her car from the apartment\ncomplex parking lot in approximately 2004 (Tr. 54). Because of the car\u2019s bad condition,\nApplicant never retrieved it from the towing company. The delinquency represents\nunpaid storage fees (Tr. 54). She does not know what the towing company has done\nwith the car (Tr. 55). The delinquency remains outstanding.\nSOR subparagraphs 1.e and 1.g through 1.j are phone bills Applicant owes to the\nsame company. The collection agent contacted her with a settlement proposal in\nFebruary 2009. Consistent with the proposal, Applicant satisfied the bills in April 2009\n(Exhibits E, F).\nSOR subparagraph 1.f is the deficiency from a car that was repossessed (Tr. 57).\nApplicant does not recall the exact date of the repossession, but contends it occurred\nbefore the property management company towed her other car in 2004. Applicant\ncontacted the creditor in 2007, and negotiated a payment plan under which she was to\npay $100 per month toward the debt\u2019s satisfaction (Tr. 57). Shortly after executing the\npayment plan, Applicant\u2019s husband lost his job. Consequently, she stopped making\npayments after a few months without satisfying the delinquency. (Tr. 57-58).\nSOR subparagraphs 1.k through 1.m remain unpaid (Tr. 23). Applicant testified\nthat she has contacted the respective creditors, and is working to satisfy them (Tr. 24).\nShe provided no documentary supporting evidence.\nIn 2004, Applicant\u2019s then-landlord sued her for allegedly breaching the lease by\nmoving before it expired (Tr. 72; see Answer, SOR subparagraph 1.n). In May 2007, the\ncourt entered a judgment against Applicant for $4,174, consisting of three months\u2019 rent,\nattorney fees, and court costs. (Tr. 68; Exhibit 4). Currently, the judgment is unpaid, and\nApplicant is working with the landlord\u2019s attorney to arrange a payment plan (Tr. 75).\nIn June 2008, Applicant met with a credit counselor who proposed a debt\ncounseling program (Tr. 90). She was unsatisfied with the proposal, and did not\ncontinue working with the counselor (Tr. 91). In February 2009, Applicant met with a\ndebt consolidation company (Tr. 91). She is not currently working with the company, but\nplans on returning (Tr. 93).\nCurrently, Applicant maintains a budget (Tr. 176; Exhibit I). She has\napproximately $490 in monthly, after-expense income. She has student loans that are\ncurrently in deferment (Tr. 114). Their deferment status will end in approximately two\nyears. The amount of the student loans is unclear from the record.\n\n4\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in December 2006. She\nanswered \u201cno\u201d in response to Questions 28A - (In the last 7 years, over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debts?), and 28B - (Currently over 90 days delinquent on any\ndebts?). On the next page of the application (Exhibit 2 at 8), she states that she incurred\na loan of an unknown amount in June 2001. At the hearing, Applicant explained that at\nthe time she completed the application, she knew she had some delinquent debts, but\nwas unsure of their identity (Tr. 79). Moreover, she testified that she could not access\nher credit report online because the credit reporting agencies had placed a fraud alert\non her credit report after she had disputed several items on it. (Exhibit 7 at 1).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n\n5\n(AG \u00b6 18). Here, Applicant satisfied SOR subparagraphs 1.e and 1.g through 1.j. I\nconclude they do not constitute a security concern. Applicant\u2019s remaining delinquencies\ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and\n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial instability has been exacerbated by her husband\u2019s erratic\nemployment. Absent two steady incomes, Applicant has neither been able to pay her\ndebts timely, nor adhere to payment plans. She has paid some of her creditors and\ncontacted others. She maintains a budget. She has not, however, followed through with\nany financial counseling. Consequently, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies, but has limited\nprobative value given her failure to complete financial counseling.\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s efforts at eliminating her delinquencies have been, at best,\nonly moderately successful, they are sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(d),\n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\u201d Because the largest delinquencies remain unpaid, however, I cannot\nconclude that AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol,\u201d applies. Applicant has not mitigated the Guideline F security concerns.\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Applicant\u2019s omissions from her security clearance application\nraise the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\naward fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies.\nAlthough Applicant did not specifically disclose the debts listed in the SOR, she\ndid disclose a judgment in response to another question about her finances. Also, she\nnoted that she incurred debt in 2001 that she characterized as \u201cunknown.\u201d I conclude\nthat Applicant\u2019s omissions indicate disorganization rather than duplicity, and that she did\nnot intentionally omit any financial information. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply. There are no\npersonal conduct security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\n\n6\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by extravagant spending.\nInstead, they were caused largely by her husband\u2019s employment woes. She has\ncontacted creditors, attended a financial counseling session, and paid some of her\ncreditors. However, she currently has not begun satisfying the two largest\ndelinquencies, SOR subparagraphs 1.f and 1.n. \nApplicant deserves credit for her excellence on the job. Also, she demonstrated\ntremendous character by completing college while working two part-time jobs and\nhelping her grandmother raise her siblings. These positive attributes are not enough at\nthis time, however, to overcome the security concern generated by her continuing\nfinancial difficulties. Upon considering Applicant\u2019s case in the context of the whole\nperson concept, I conclude that her application for a security clearance must be denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.g - 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.k - 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - -2.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated September 17, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g, 2.a. and 2.b, and 3.a. and 3.b of the SOR. He provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from high school in June 2000. From January 2002 until May 2006, he served on active duty in the United States Army (USA) as a tank crew member, including one year in Iraq as a combat veteran. He was injured in combat and received a disability when he was discharged. Applicant did not hold a security clearance during his military career (Tr. 26). Applicant married in 2004. He has two young children. He is currently attending college classes working toward a degree. He has worked for his current employer since November 2006 (GE 2). In 1996, when Applicant was in high school, he associated with gang members. On one occasion, he took his father\u2019s shotgun and used a hacksaw to cut off the barrel which resulted in a 14 inch barrel, a dangerous weapon under the state law. His mother found the weapon in his bedroom while he was at school. She reported the incident to school officials. Applicant was 14-years-old at the time (Tr. 31).

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on June 8, 2007.\nOn August 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines J, G and\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on December 16, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January\n13, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 18, 2009. The\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GE 1-6), which were received without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf and presented the testimony of one witness. He did not\nsubmit any Exhibits at the hearing. I held the record open until March 12, 2009, so that\nMarch 31, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant could submit documents. The submission was timely received, marked as\n(AE) A and entered into the record. Department Counsel did not object to the\ndocuments. DOHA received the transcript on March 23, 2009. Based upon a review of\nthe record, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 17, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g, 2.a. and 2.b, and 3.a. and 3.b of the SOR. He\nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in June 2000. From January 2002 until May 2006, he served on active duty\nin the United States Army (USA) as a tank crew member, including one year in Iraq as a\ncombat veteran. He was injured in combat and received a disability when he was\ndischarged. Applicant did not hold a security clearance during his military career (Tr.\n26).\nApplicant married in 2004. He has two young children. He is currently attending\ncollege classes working toward a degree. He has worked for his current employer since\nNovember 2006 (GE 2). \nIn 1996, when Applicant was in high school, he associated with gang members.\nOn one occasion, he took his father\u2019s shotgun and used a hacksaw to cut off the barrel\nwhich resulted in a 14 inch barrel, a dangerous weapon under the state law. His mother\nfound the weapon in his bedroom while he was at school. She reported the incident to\nschool officials. Applicant was 14-years-old at the time (Tr. 31). He was arrested and\ncharged with (1) Possessing a Dangerous Weapon, felony, and (2) Theft. He pleaded\nguilty to Count (1) and was sentenced to three days detention, two years probation, and\nan alcohol and drug treatment program. This charge has been expunged from\nApplicant\u2019s record (GE 6; Tr. 19).\nIn 1999, Applicant left a hunting rifle in his car after he and his father had been\nhunting. He forgot about the rifle when he returned home. The rifle was unloaded and\npacked in a case in the trunk of the car. He parked his car on school premises. His\ngirlfriend alerted school officials that he had a weapon. The police found the rifle in the\ntrunk of the car. He was arrested and charged with (1) Unlawful Possession of Weapon\non School Grounds and (2) Criminal Mischief. He pleaded guilty to Count (1) and was\nsentenced to 45 days detention, 39 days suspended, two years probation, community\nservice, and restitution. Count (2) was dismissed (GE 5).\nOn November 23, 2002, Applicant was out drinking in a bar or restaurant with\nsome of his Army friends. It was the night before his deployment to Iraq. The group\nbecame loud and rambunctious. A police officer arrived but Applicant did not believe he\nwas charged with any offense (Tr. 21). He was let go about fifteen minutes after the\n\n3\npolice arrived. Applicant was charged with (1) Menacing and (2) Disorderly Conduct\n(Tr.21).\nOn November 30, 2002, Applicant was driving home very early in the morning\nfrom a party at a friends house. He had slept at the friend\u2019s house that evening but he\nhad to go to work. He fell asleep at the wheel and hit another car. The driver of the other\ncar sustained minor injuries. Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving Under\nthe Influence and (2) Careless driving-Cause Death/Injury. He pleaded guilty to Driving\nWhile Ability Impaired and was sentenced to 180 days, one year probation, community\nservice, and an alcohol evaluation. Count (2) was dismissed (GE 5).\nIn January 2003, Applicant was partying with some friends. After having a couple\nof drinks, he decided to drive back to his parent\u2019s home. He was pulled over on two\noccasions by a police officer. Applicant was charged with (1) Driving Under the\nInfluence, (2) DUI Per Se, (3) Lane Usage Violation, and (4) Alcohol-Underage\nPossession/ Consumption. All charges were dismissed on a technicality (Tr. 35).\nHowever, Applicant acknowledged that he was drunk (Tr. 33).\nIn June 2004, Applicant was charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence, (2)\nDUI over .10, (3) Instruct Permit, and (4) Safety Belt Use. He was sentenced to\nattended alcohol classes, fines, and the loss of his driver\u2019s license for one year. There\nare no specific details about this incident in the record. (GE 4; GE 6).\nOn March 25, 2007, Applicant had been drinking at home all day and he admitted\nthat he was intoxicated (Tr. 38). He and his wife had a verbal argument. His wife and\ntwo children left the house (GE 6 ). He heard a noise outside and wanted to check for\nany intruders. He took a shot gun outside and pointed it in the air. He was yelling. His\nneighbor saw him, became alarmed and called the police. When his wife returned to the\nhome, she stated that he had punched a hole in the closet door (GE 6). Applicant was\ncharged with (1) Menacing, felony, and (2) Prohibited Use of Weapons-Drunk W/Gun.\nHe pleaded guilty to Count (2) and was sentenced to one year probation, alcohol\nevaluation, and fines. \nApplicant completed a Security Clearance Application on June 8, 2007. He\nanswered Section 23(b) by listing a 1999 weapons offense. He did not list the underage\nweapons offense in 1996 because he had been advised that since the charge was\nexpunged in 2006, it was no longer on his record and he did not have anything to report\n(Tr. 42). He did not list the 2007 weapons/drunk offense because he misread the\nquestion. He did not understand that he had to list any charges. He was still in the court\nprocess and had not been convicted of the weapons offense (Tr.24).\nApplicant answered Section 23(d) concerning charges or convictions of any\noffenses relating to alcohol or drugs by listing the June 2004 DUI offense. He did not list\nthe other alcohol related offenses from November 2002 and January 2003, because he\ndid not have any paperwork from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and he was\nnot clear on any charges or convictions. He did not realize that he could update his\n\n4\nsecurity clearance application at a later time. He claimed he was rushing to get the\napplication completed. He did not list the March 25, 2007, for the same reasons as\nstated for Section 23(b). Applicant was credible at the hearing that he told his employers\nabout the incidents but he had a difficult time completing the questionnaire on line. He\ncompleted the questions to the best of his ability. He was not trying to hide anything\nabout his police record because he listed two charges from his police record.\nApplicant completed interrogatories in April 2008. He admits to having had a\nproblem with alcohol. He claims he has not had any alcohol since March 25, 2007 (GE\n5; Tr. 24). Applicant completed an alcohol/drug evaluation in April 2008. The certified\ntherapist interviewed Applicant and screened him using various instruments. He was\ndiagnosed as \u201calcohol dependent\u201d (AE A). One screening for alcoholism indicted \u201chigh\nalcoholism probability.\u201d He completed 12 sessions in chemical dependency groups\n(Tr.40). Recommendations from the 2008 report include attendance at a monthly\nindividual session to address immediate needs and assess sobriety progress (AE A at\n4). Random urinalysis is recommended and a followup/aftercare plan. Applicant was\ntested on March 10, 2008 for all substances and the findings were negative.\nApplicant claims he does not drink any more because he wants to improve the\nquality of his life. He acknowledges his mistakes. He believes the 2007 incident was a\nwake up call. He understands the seriousness of the misuse of alcohol in his life. He\ndoes not participate in any support groups. He does not see a therapist or a counselor\non a regular basis. He explained that he was told if he felt the need - just call. He called\nthe therapist twice in the past year when he felt a relapse (Tr. 63).\nApplicant is a hard-working employee. He is very reliable and has displayed a\ngreat degree of initiative in his current position. He has shown dedication and\nprofessionalism in the workplace. He is recommended for a security clearance by his\nmanager. His manager knows about Applicant\u2019s 2007 alcohol incident and believes\nthere is no reason he should not have a security clearance (Tr. 54). \nApplicant\u2019s evaluations rate him as \u201cconsistently exceeds\u201d or \u201cmeets/\noccasionally exceeds\u201d in all categories. He contributes to a high customer satisfaction\nand effective team performance. He has an in-depth knowledge of the mission and\ntechnical performance. He trains fellow employees (AE A).\nApplicant is entitled to wear the following: Army Commendation Medal; Army\nAchievement Medal; Army Good Conduct Medal; National Defense Service Medal; Iraq\nCampaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal; Army Service Ribbon; and Overseas\nService Ribbon (GE 3). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n5\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By it\u2019s\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\nApplicant was arrested in 1996 and 1999 for weapons charges when he was in\nhigh school. In 2002, 2003 and 2004, Applicant was arrested for alcohol/driving\nincidents. He was convicted of Driving While Intoxicated (DUI) in 2004. In 2007,\nApplicant was arrested, charged and pleaded guilty to an incident of weapons/drunk\nwith gun.  AG \u00b6 31(a) and (c) apply in this case.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nApplicant has provided some mitigation under this guideline. His youthful\nincidents of criminal conduct occurred ten years ago. The 1996 incident has been\nexpunged. He was young and associating with the wrong crowd.\nApplicant had three incidents involving alcohol/driving in 2002, 2003, and 2004.\nThe 2003 charges were dismissed on technical grounds. He was convicted for the other\noffenses. He completed probation successfully. He attended alcohol classes. His last\ndriving offense that involved alcohol occurred in 2004. \nIn 2007, Applicant was intoxicated and took a shot gun outside of his home one\nevening. He had a verbal altercation with his wife and she left the home with the two\nyoung children. He alarmed his neighbor when he had the shot gun in the air and was\nyelling. \n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s last incident of criminal conduct was the March 2007 incident. He has\nabstained from alcohol which was involved in that 2007 incident. He completed a 12\nsession chemical dependency group in 2008. He completed his probation in March\n2008. However, two years of abstaining from alcohol is not sufficient when compared\nwith the more than five years from 2002 to 2007 of alcohol related offenses, to mitigate\nthe government\u2019s case. He has shown that he is on the right track but it is too soon to\nfind that he is successfully rehabilitated. Thus, AG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) do not apply in this\ncase\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d and \u201c22(c) \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\nIn this case, Applicant admitted to his arrests involving alcohol. Some of the\ncharges were dismissed but Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI. He admitted to consuming\nalcohol, at times to excess, from at least 2002 to March 2007 as described above. AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 22 (a) and (c) apply.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(C) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a\ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and\nrelapse, and is making satisfactory progress; and,\n\n8\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant has acknowledged his problem with alcohol. He claims he has been\nabstinent since March 2007. He completed his probations successfully. He attended\nand completed a 48 hour alcohol education program. His April 2008 evaluation reflects\nthat prior to his abstinence, he would be in an \u201calcohol dependency diagnosis\u201d. He\nattended and completed a 12 session chemical dependency group. He is not in an\naftercare program and does not attend any support groups. He consults a therapist if he\nbelieves he needs the support. He tested negative in March 2008 for all substances. \nApplicant has a very good work record with his current employer. He is\nrecommended for his fine work. Applicant does not want alcohol to ruin his life. He\nvalues his work and now admits that he made mistakes. The last alcohol-related\nincidents is two years old. Given the poor judgment shown in that incident, the severity\nof the incident, and only two years of no alcohol-related incidents there is still an issue\nof concern. Applicant has not mitigated the alcohol consumption concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6\n23(a), (c)and (d). \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d is\npotentially disqualifying.\nApplicant listed certain offenses on his security clearance application in response\nto Section 23 concerning his police record. He acknowledged that he omitted other\noffenses. He denied, however, that he had a deliberate intent to falsify his answers to\n\n9\nthe questions. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the\nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish pr prove\nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative\njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine where there is direct\nor circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time\nthe omission occurred. \nApplicant testified credibly that he did not list the other offenses because he did\nnot understand the question. He did not list the 1996 offense because it was expunged.\nHe only listed the 2004 alcohol-related incident. I find that he did not intentionally falsify\nhis answers to the above-referenced questions.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6\n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the Army for a\nnumber of years. He served in a combat situation. He was injured and discharged with a\ndisability. He is married with two children. He supports his family. He is working steadily\nand is highly recommended for a security clearance.\nApplicant admits his mistakes in judgment. He completed alcohol counseling and\nhis probation. Applicant\u2019s patterns of criminal conduct and problems with alcohol span a\nlong period. His last incident was in 2007. He has taken steps in the right direction but\nat this time, Applicant has not met his burden of proof to overcome the government\u2019s\ncase.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\n\n10\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nconduct and alcoholism consumption. He has mitigated the personal conduct concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.e, 2.a, and 2.b. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 23-year-old shipfitter employed by a defense contractor. He grew up in a small Southern town and graduated from high school in May 2006, ranking third in his class of 85 students. (AX C.) He was an honor student and an accomplished athlete. During his senior year in high school, he worked as a bagboy and stocker at a grocery store and as a cashier and cook at a fast-food restaurant. (GX 1 at 13.) In August 2006, he moved to another state and began working for his current employer. He completed an apprenticeship as a shipfitter in October 2010 (AX D.) He has never held a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s current supervisor has designated him to be his second-in-charge. He describes Applicant as very intelligent, open-minded, creative, and calm and composed under pressure. (AX A.) A veteran police officer from Applicant\u2019s home town, who has known Applicant for 15 years, describes him as respectful, responsible, and trustworthy. (Tr. 95; AX B.)

O\u2019Neil, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines J (Criminal \nConduct) and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 19, 2007. \nOn December 14, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny \nhis application, citing security concerns under Guidelines J and E. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on December 20, 2010; answered it on January 4, \n2011; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nMay 11, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrequest on January 6, 2011. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 9, \n2011, and the case was assigned to me on February 14, 2011. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on February 15, 2011, scheduling it for March 9, 2011. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 9 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Department Counsel also submitted the discovery letter dated February 2, \n2011, in lieu of a list of exhibits. It is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. (Tr. 25-\n26.) Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 17, 2011. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. \nHe denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.e, 2.a, and 2.b. His admissions in his answer and \nat the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 23-year-old shipfitter employed by a defense contractor. He grew \nup in a small Southern town and graduated from high school in May 2006, ranking third \nin his class of 85 students. (AX C.) He was an honor student and an accomplished \nathlete. During his senior year in high school, he worked as a bagboy and stocker at a \ngrocery store and as a cashier and cook at a fast-food restaurant. (GX 1 at 13.) In \nAugust 2006, he moved to another state and began working for his current employer. \nHe completed an apprenticeship as a shipfitter in October 2010 (AX D.) He has never \nheld a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor has designated him to be his second-in-charge. He \ndescribes Applicant as very intelligent, open-minded, creative, and calm and composed \nunder pressure. (AX A.) A veteran police officer from Applicant\u2019s home town, who has \nknown Applicant for 15 years, describes him as respectful, responsible, and trustworthy. \n(Tr. 95; AX B.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that when he was in the ninth grade, a group of young men \nstarted bullying him because a girl had a \u201ccrush\u201d on him. During his first year of high \nschool, three of the bullies attacked him at a party, and he was hospitalized with his \ninjuries. He reported the incident to the police, but no action was taken against his \nattackers. (Tr. 36-37.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that during his four years of high school, he sometimes was \nable to avoid confrontations, but he became accustomed to them. He told his mother \neach time he was involved in a fight. He and his mother discussed the possibility of him \nliving with his sister, who is a probation officer, but he stayed at home until he began his \ncurrent employment. (Tr. 67-68.) \n \n \nWhile Applicant was working at a grocery store, he was attacked by three \nmembers of the same group while he was putting groceries in the car of an elderly \ncustomer. He also reported this incident to the police, but no action was taken. (Tr. 37.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn November 2005, Applicant and a friend were driving home after a football \ngame when another car tried to run him off the road. He pulled into a car wash and the \nother car followed him. When the occupants of the other car got out at the car wash and \napproached him, he recognized them as members of the same group of bullies, and he \ndecided to stand his ground. A police officer arrived as Applicant and one of the group \nwere fighting, and both combatants were charged with disorderly conduct. (Tr. 63.) \nApplicant was fined $247 plus costs. (Tr. 38-39; GX 3.)  \n \n \nIn about February 2006, Applicant was shot in the leg by a brother of one of the \nbullies. (Tr. 59, 86; GX 2 at 4.) The person who shot him was in jail in April 2006, but \nApplicant did not know if it was because of this shooting. (Tr. 85.) \n \n \nAt the night of April 8-9, 2006, Applicant was at a party when he was involved in \nanother altercation with two of the same group of bullies. As Applicant was approached \nby the two young men, who were cursing and threatening him, Applicant threw the first \npunch, knocking one of them unconscious, and then he attacked the other. After the \naltercation, Applicant left the party and went home. He testified that the same group \nwent to his home, but his mother called the police, who ordered the group to leave and \nwatched the house all night to avoid further violence. (Tr. 43-44; GX 7 at 9, 33, 75.) At \nabout noon on April 9, 2006, the mother of one of the two men involved in the \naltercation with Applicant filed a complaint with the local police. The police report was \napproved by a supervising officer on April 17, 2006, but the record does not reflect \nwhether any formal charges were filed or whether there was any other disposition of the \ncomplaint. (GX 4.)  \n \nAt about 10:00 p.m. on April 9, 2006, Applicant was carrying out trash in \nconnection with his job at the fast-food restaurant when he was approached by a man \nbrandishing a pistol. Another restaurant employee who was helping with the trash heard \nthe other person say, \u201cI got you now,\u201d and he heard Applicant say \u201cOh sh--!\u201d (GX 5 at 2; \nGX 7 at 74.) Applicant testified that he did not know his assailant, but he later learned \nthat the assailant was the brother of the person who previously shot him in the leg. (Tr. \n59; GX 2 at 4.) Applicant retreated behind the trash container but his assailant followed. \nApplicant testified that he lunged at his assailant, knocking the pistol out of his hand. \nApplicant picked up the pistol, and when his assailant continued to advance toward him, \nhe pointed the pistol at his assailant and shot him twice. When his assailant ran away, \nApplicant dropped the pistol and went back into the restaurant. (Tr. 47-50.) His assailant \ndied shortly thereafter. \n \n \nAfter the shooting, Applicant\u2019s coworker ran back into the restaurant and shouted \nthat Applicant had been shot. (GX 7 at 60.) Then Applicant ran into the restaurant and \ntold the manager, \u201cI shot him.\u201d The manager locked the door and called the police. (GX \n7 at 6.) \n \nTwo witnesses, who were cousins of the assailant, said Applicant fired at least \ntwo shots at his fleeing assailant. A police officer stated that Applicant admitted shooting \nat the assailant as he fled. At the hearing, Applicant denied trying to shoot his fleeing \n\n \n4 \n \n \nassailant in the back, denied wanting to kill him, and denied admitting to the police that \nhe shot at his fleeing assailant. He testified he simply wanted his assailant to go away. \n(Tr. 49-50, 53, 59; GX 5; GX 7 at 23, 28.) He testified that it was dark, he was \nfrightened, he had never fired a weapon before, and he probably closed his eyes when \nhe fired. He thought the shot hit his assailant in the chest. (Tr. 82.) During an interview \nwith a security investigator in June 2007, Applicant told the investigator he shot his \nassailant in the chest. (GX 2 at 3.) \n \n \nAn autopsy determined that the assailant was shot in the wrist and fatally shot in \nthe left lateral upper back. The fatal shot penetrated the assailant\u2019s body from left to \nright. The trajectory of the bullet was \u201c15 degrees forward slightly upward and to the \nright.\u201d It penetrated the lower lobe of the left lung, grazed the posterior esophagus, \nperforated the thoracic aorta, penetrated the middle and lower lobes of the right lung, \nand lodged in the right pectoral muscle. (GX 7 at 47-56.)  \n \n \nApplicant was charged with murder. He was held in jail until April 19, 2006, when \nhe was released on bond, placed on house arrest, allowed to finish high school, and \nallowed to begin his apprenticeship with his current employer, even though the \napprenticeship was in another state. (GX 6 at 28-29; Answer to SOR at 2.) He was \nindicted for murder in July 2006. (GX 6 at 5.)  \n \nOn a date not reflected in the record, Applicant was charged with providing false \ninformation to the police. The record reflects that he was notified of the murder charge \non April 19, 2006 and advised of his right to counsel. (GX 6 at 25.) There is nothing in \nthe record reflecting that he was informed of the charge of providing false information to \nthe police or a charge of assault and battery. On September 6, 2006, a judge found him \nnot guilty of providing false information to the police. (GX 8.) On October 22, 2009, he \nwas tried by jury and found not guilty of the murder charge. (GX 6 at 2-3.)  \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in March 2007, he was awaiting trial for \nmurder. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 23a, asking if he had ever been charged with or \nconvicted of any felony offense; question 23b, asking if he had ever been charged with \nor convicted of a firearms or explosives offense; and question 23f, asking if he had been \narrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not listed in the preceding \nquestions during the last seven years. He answered \u201cYes\u201d to question 23c, asking if \nthere were currently any charges pending against him for any criminal offense, and he \nexplained, \u201cI was attacked at work and the attacker was the one that was injured.\u201d He \ndid not mention that he had killed his attacker. He also did not disclose a charge of \ngiving false information to the police or his November 2005 conviction of disorderly \nconduct.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not disclose the conviction for disorderly conduct \nbecause there were so many incidents that he did not recall the November 2005 \nincident when he completed his SCA. (Tr. 41.) He testified that he was unaware of the \ncharge of providing false information to the police or its disposition. (Tr. 41-42.) His \nemployment records show that he worked full eight-hour days at the site of his \n\n \n5 \n \n \napprenticeship from September 5 through September 12, 2006, indicating that he was \nnot in his former home state when the judge disposed of the charge on September 6, \n2006. (AX F at 2.) He testified that he was not aware of the accusation of assault and \nbattery until his lawyer told him about it shortly before his trial date in October 2009. (Tr. \n54.) \n \n \nIn June 2008, Applicant was charged with reckless driving by speeding in excess \nof 80 miles per hour on an interstate highway. He testified that he was speeding \nbecause he was on his way to visit his girlfriend, who had become seriously ill. (Tr. 92.) \nHe pleaded guilty and was fined $250 plus costs. (GX 9.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \n\n \n6 \n \n \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was charged with and convicted of disorderly conduct \nin November 2005 (\u00b6 1.a), charged with assault and battery in April 2006 (\u00b6 1.b), \ncharged with murder and providing false information to the police in April 2006 and \nfound not guilty of both charges (\u00b6 1.c), and charged with misdemeanor reckless driving \nin August 2008 (\u00b6 1.d). Applicant admitted these allegations.  \n \n \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant provided false information during an \ninterview with a security investigator in June 2007 and in response to questions about \nhis criminal record on his SCA (\u00b6 1.e). Applicant denied these allegations. \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, \nor convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence summarized above are sufficient to \nraise AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). Accordingly, the burden shifted to Applicant to refute, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts established by the evidence. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). The first prong of \nthis mitigating condition focuses on whether the criminal conduct was recent. There are \nno Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must \nbe based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time \nhas passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must \ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \nThe conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c occurred between four and five years \nago, when Applicant was a high school student. The conduct was the product of \nrepeated bullying experienced by Applicant, a circumstance that no longer exists. \nApplicant was culpable in the disorderly conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a because he \nchose to confront his tormenters rather than avoid the conflict. He was culpable in the \nassault and battery alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b because he chose to throw the first punch \nrather than avoid the conflict. With respect to the conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.c, he was the \nvictim of an armed assault, and he was acquitted of the murder charge after a full \nlitigation of the facts before a jury. He was acquitted by a judge of providing false \ninformation to the police regarding the fatal shooting. Notwithstanding his stressful \ncircumstances in April 2006, he completed high school with honors. He successfully \ncompleted a five-year apprenticeship, and is highly regarded by his supervisor. I \nconclude that the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c is not recent, that it happened \nunder circumstances making it unlikely to recur, and that it does not cast doubt on the \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Accordingly, I conclude that \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c. \n \nApplicant\u2019s reckless driving alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is more recent, but it was an \nisolated incident, a minor offense, and it occurred while Applicant was under the stress \nof a pending trial for murder, had just begun his apprenticeship, and was concerned \nabout the serious illness of his girlfriend. I conclude that AG \u00b6 32(a) is established for \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 2.a allege that Applicant provided deliberately false information \nto a security investigator when he stated that he shot his assailant in the chest. \nApplicant\u2019s statement was incorrect, as established by the autopsy report. However, I \nconclude that it was not deliberately false. The autopsy determined that the bullet \nentered the left lateral upper back and penetrated from both lungs and the aorta, \nmoving from left to right. This trajectory is consistent with the likelihood that the \nassailant was facing Applicant and then turned to his right as the fatal shot was fired. I \nam satisfied that Applicant believed that he shot his assailant in the chest, but his recall \nof the event, clouded by the speed at which it happened and Applicant\u2019s fear for his life, \nwas incorrect. Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. I am satisfied \nthat he did not deliberately provide false information to the security investigator. Thus, I \nconclude that Applicant has refuted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, as cross-alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 2.b allege that Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately failing \nto fully disclose his criminal history. At the time he submitted his SCA, he had just \ngraduated from high school, and he had no experience with federal employment or the \nsecurity clearance process. See ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010) \n(level of education and experience relevant to determining whether failure to disclose \ninformation on security clearance application was deliberate). He was pending trial for \nmurder, living away from home for the first time, and starting a new job.  \n \nI find that Applicant\u2019s explanation for not disclosing the November 2005 \ndisorderly conduct was plausible and credible. In the context of four years of repeated \nviolent confrontations and his stressful environment when he submitted his SCA, a \nsingle fistfight would not have been a memorable event.  \n \nI likewise find that Applicant\u2019s explanations for not disclosing the assault and \nbattery and the charge of providing false information to the police plausible and credible. \nThere is no evidence that the assault and battery complaint resulted in a formal charge \nand no evidence that Applicant was informed of it. Likewise, there was no evidence that \nApplicant was informed of the charge of providing false information to the police. He \nwas out of the state when a judge disposed of the charge.  \n \nApplicant understated the nature of the offense for which he was pending trial, \nbut he gave enough information to alert security investigators that he was pending trial \nfor a criminal offense and further inquiry was required. I have considered the \ncircumstances in which Applicant completed his SCA, his youth and inexperience at the \ntime, and his candor and sincerity at the hearing. I am satisfied that he did not \ndeliberately falsify his SCA. \n \nSecurity concerns raised by criminal conduct may be mitigated by \u201cevidence that \nthe person did not commit the offense.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(c). The evidence discussed above \nestablishes that Applicant was not guilty of murder, providing false information to the \npolice, deliberately giving false information to a security investigator, or intentionally \nfalsifying his security clearance application. I conclude that AG \u00b6 32(c) is established for \nthe offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.e, and I resolve those allegations in his favor. \n \nSecurity concerns raised by criminal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d  AG \u00b6 \n32(d). Applicant has moved away from the small town where the offenses in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.c occurred. Five years have elapsed with no recurrence of similar offenses. He \nhas completed a rigorous apprenticeship and earned the trust and respect of his \nsupervisor. I conclude that AG \u00b6 32(d) is established for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.c. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThe speeding violation was more recent. However, for the reasons set out in the \nabove discussion of AG \u00b6 32(a), I conclude that AG \u00b6 32(d) also is established for SOR \n\u00b6 1.d. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e under this guideline. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under this guideline are: AG 16(a) \n(\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire\u201d) and AG \u00b6 16(b) (\u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d For the \nreasons set out in the above discussion of Guideline J, I conclude that neither of these \ndisqualifying conditions is raised.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant is a young adult working at his first full-time job. In spite of attending \nhigh school in a hostile and stressful environment, he was an honor student and an \naccomplished athlete. A local police officer who knew him during the time period at \nissue in this case described him as responsible and trustworthy. Applicant has \ncompleted a five-year apprenticeship, earned the trust and respect of his supervisor, \nand is on his way to more responsible positions.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nF and E, Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 20, 2009, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on July \nOctober 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n24, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 3, 2009, scheduling the hearing \nfor August 18, 2009. The case was reassigned to me on August 12, 2009. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nSeptember 2, 2009.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nEvidence \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were received without \nobjection. Department Counsel requested administrative notice of a document which he \ndescribed as a printout of what is viewed on the computer screen when an applicant is \nelectronically filling out a security clearance application. The printout was marked \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I. The request for administrative notice was denied. The \ngovernment then offered the document as a government exhibit. The document was \nremarked as GE 6 and admitted without objection.  \n \nApplicant testified on his own behalf, called two witnesses, and submitted \nExhibits (AE) A through N, which were received without objection. The record was held \nopen for Applicant to submit additional information. Applicant submitted numerous \ndocuments, which were marked AE O through DD and admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s memorandum is marked HE II. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is seeking to \nrenew his security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since 2004. He \nserved in the military from 1997 through 2001, and was honorably discharged. He is \nattending college. He was married from 1999 until his divorce in 2000. He married again \nin 2001. He has three children, ages 10, 6, and 3. He has custody of his 10-year-old \nchild from his first marriage.1  \n \n \nApplicant was laid off from his employment in about February 2003. His wife was \neight-months pregnant, and he lost his medical insurance. She had a difficult pregnancy \nthen was unable to work. He obtained another job, but at a lesser salary. He worked \nseveral jobs with periods of unemployment until he was hired by his current employer in \nNovember 2004. During his period of underemployment and unemployment, a number \nof debts became delinquent and his leased car was repossessed. Applicant also \nengaged in a protracted custody battle over his oldest child, which involved high legal \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 71-72; GE 1. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nfees.2 Applicant stated that he attempted to work with his creditors and various \ncollection companies after his employment stabilized:  \n \nI took budgeting classes and began trying to sort through the entire \nnegative portion of our credit history. I made every attempt to deal with all \nof the collectors. It was overwhelming. Many of the debts had changed \nhands several times. Most of the debt collectors had trouble providing any \noriginal information on the debts or sources. Some of the companies did \nnot even exist anymore. \n \nFrustrated I did what amounted to burying my head in the sand. I stopped \nchecking my credit report. I gave up trying to get any kind of credit and \nresolved myself to save for anything we needed.3  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 21 delinquent debts. Applicant admitted owing the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.t. He denied owing the \nremaining debts. The total amount owed on the nine debts that Applicant admitted \nowing is about $14,500. Four of the nine debts that Applicant admitted owing are \nmedical debts, totaling $364. Those four debts are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.j, 1.m, and \n1.t. Six of the twelve debts that Applicant denied owing are also medical debts, totaling \n$700. Those six debts are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.o through 1.r, and 1.u. Applicant \nprovided evidence of numerous payments to medical providers. It also appears that \nseveral of the medical debts may be duplicates.4 Other individual debts are addressed \nbelow. \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent debt of $596 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The \ndebt is listed on the credit report dated October 5, 2007, but it is not listed on credit \nreports dated July 16, 2008, January 23, 2009, April 20, 2009, and August 17, 2009.5 \n \n \nOn August 25, 2009, Applicant settled the delinquent debt of $4,777 to a \ncollection company on behalf of a financial institution, with a payment of $2,982. This \ndebt was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d.6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a delinquent debt of $12,374 for the deficiency owed on a car \nlease after it was repossessed in December 2003. Applicant admitted he had a car that \nwas leased through the creditor named in the allegation, and the car was repossessed. \nHe disputes the amount of the debt. He stated that he paid the lease for five years on a \nsix-year lease and he did not believe he should still owe more than $12,000. The credit \n                                                          \n2 Tr. at 29-32, 50-58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n4 Tr. at 39, 60-64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE U, W, Z-CC. \n \n5 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE H, M. \n \n6 AE W, X. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nreports list the account as opened in January 2001, with payments of $475 per month \nfor 64 months. The high credit on the debt is listed as $30,460, and the first delinquency \nis listed as occurring in December 2003. The balance on the debt was listed as $12,533 \non the 2007 credit report and $12,374 on the four credit reports from 2008 and 2009.7   \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent debt of $605 to a telecommunications \ncompany, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. He admitted that he and his wife had cell phone \nservice with the company, but he stated they discontinued the service after the end of \ntheir contract. He stated that he disputed the debt with the telecommunications \ncompany, but he did not dispute it with the credit reporting agencies. He was uncertain if \nthe credit management company he is utilizing disputed the debt. He did not submit any \ndocuments in support of the dispute. The debt is listed on the 2007 credit report and \nboth 2008 credit reports. It is not specifically listed under the telecommunications \ncompany on the two reports from 2009, but both reports list a debt of $605 to a \ncollection company.8 \n \n \nA state tax lien of $8,481 for tax year 2003 was filed against Applicant in \nDecember 2007, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n. The state notified Applicant that he did not \nfile his state income tax return for that year. Applicant stated that he filed both his state \nand federal tax returns for that year. His federal return was filed electronically, but he \nhad to mail his state return. He stated that he did not keep a paper copy of the return, \nand he lost the electronic copy from his computer when the computer crashed. The \nstate has recouped this debt through garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages.9 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.s concern delinquent debts to the same telecommunications \ncompany alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Applicant admitted owing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g \nbut denied owing the other two debts. There is insufficient evidence for a determination \nthat these represent distinct debts.10  \n \n \nApplicant has not made any payments on the four remaining non-medical debts \nthat he admitted he owed. Those four debts, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.l, \ntotal about $9,400.11 \n \n \nApplicant was questioned about his finances for his background investigation on \nNovember 8, 2007. He admitted to his delinquent debts and described how he got into \nfinancial difficulties. He stated that both he and his wife were working at that time, and \nthey were in good financial shape. He stated he had contacted a financial \ncounseling/credit management company the month before, and he intended to make \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 31, 68-70; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE H, M. \n \n8 Tr. at 66-68; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE H, M. \n \n9 Tr. at 49-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE F. \n \n10 Tr. at 60-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE H, M. \n \n11 Tr. at 64-65; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n\n \n5 \n \narrangements to pay his delinquent debts. Applicant is now earning a good income. He \nhas a budget. He worked in Iraq and made about $152,000 in 2008. He also worked in \nIraq during 2009. Applicant contracted with the credit management company in \nDecember 2008. He stated that he will pay his delinquent debts after the credit \nmanagement company verifies the debts and negotiates settlements. He and his wife \nhave paid a number of debts not alleged in the SOR.12  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) on August \n28, 2007. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 27b, which asked \u201cIn the last 7 years, have \nyou had your wages garnished or had any property repossessed for any reason?\u201d He \nalso answered \u201cNo\u201d to Questions 28a and 28b, which asked \u201cIn the last 7 years, have \nyou been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and \u201cAre you currently over 90 \ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant denied intentionally falsifying the SF 86. He \nstated that he did not know all the facts of his credit history when he submitted the SF \n86, and many of the debts had been sold to collection companies. He stated that he \nknew his credit report would be pulled, and he would be able to discuss his finances \nwith an investigator. At the hearing, he continued to deny any intent to mislead the \ngovernment about his finances. Finally, after several evasive answers, he admitted that \nhe knew the answers to the financial questions on the SF 86 were untruthful.13 After \nconsidering all the evidence, I find that Applicant intentionally falsified his SF 86.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a performance appraisal from his company for the annual \nperiod ending September 2008. It reflected superior job performance, both in the U.S. \nand overseas. A witness who has known Applicant since they served together in the \nmilitary testified to Applicant\u2019s character, the source of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, \nand that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were being addressed.14  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n                                                          \n12 Tr. at 35-40, 59; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE A-E, G, J-L, N, P-W, Z-CC. \n \n13 Tr. at 41-48, 73-75, 102-103; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6. \n \n14 Tr. at 76-82; AE I. \n\n \n6 \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant settled one debt after the hearing. He has not resolved a number of \nother debts alleged in the SOR. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) \nis not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his divorce, custody battle, \nunemployment, underemployment, and his wife\u2019s medical issues. These all qualify as \nconditions that were outside his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires \nthat the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant told the \nbackground investigator in November 2007, that his finances had stabilized, both he \nand his wife were working, he had contacted a credit management company, and he \nintended to pay his delinquent debts. He did not contract with the credit management \n\n \n8 \n \ncompany until December 2008. His tax debt was paid through a wage garnishment; he \nsettled one debt after the hearing; and he paid a number of medical debts. Applicant \nearned $152,000 last year. He also worked in Iraq in 2009, which would indicate a \nsubstantial salary for this year. Because of the amount of money he earned, without \nadditional voluntary and timely payments on his delinquent debts, I am unable to make \na finding that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially \napplicable.  \n \n \nApplicant has received some financial counseling. He earned a large salary the \nlast two years. However, he has not made sufficient payments on his delinquent debts \nfor a finding that there are clear indications that his financial problems are resolved or \nunder control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant paid several debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable to those debts. Those \npayments do not support a finding that he made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve all \nhis delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable to the unpaid debts. \n \n \nApplicant paid a number of medical debts and disputed others. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20 (d) and 20(e) are applicable to the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, 1.j, 1.m, \n1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, 1.t. and 1.u. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.s are duplicates of the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to the duplicate debts. It is also \napplicable to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, which does not appear on the four most recent \ncredit reports. Applicant did not submit documents in support of his dispute of the debt \nto a telecommunications company alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to \nthat debt. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified his SF 86 in August 2007, when he failed to \ndivulge an automobile repossession and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable as a \ndisqualifying condition.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant discussed his finances and delinquent debts when he was interviewed \nfor his background investigation in November 2007. That does not constitute a prompt, \ngood-faith effort to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts. While \nhe receives credit for discussing the information with the investigator, it is insufficient to \nestablish a mitigating condition. I find that no mitigating conditions are applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s honorable military record, important service to this country as a \ncontractor in Iraq, favorable employment performance, and his character evidence. \nApplicant went through a difficult period financially, caused by his divorce, a protracted \ncustody battle, unemployment, underemployment, and his wife\u2019s medical issues. He has \nworked for his current employer since 2004. His service in Iraq generated a large \nincome. Applicant does not have a huge amount of delinquent debt remaining. His \nfailure to address his finances speaks more toward a disregard of his obligations rather \nthan an inability to pay his debts. He intentionally provided false information on his SF \n86; he was less than truthful in his response to the SOR; and he was evasive at the \nhearing. \nSerious \ndoubts \nremain \nabout \nApplicant\u2019s \njudgment, \nhonesty, \nand \ntrustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.k: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.u: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations under Guideline F, Financial Considerations and denies all of the allegations under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. Applicant is a 38-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed with his company since October 2007. He has a high school diploma, some college and technical school credit. He is separated from his wife and has a son, age 13. (Tr at 5, 19-20; Gov 1.)

On July 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 11, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nNovember 14, 2008. The case was assigned to me on November 19, 2008. On \nDecember 3, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for \nDecember 19, 2008. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered five \nexhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5. The Applicant \ntestified. The record was held open until January 9, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit \nFebruary 6, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \ndocuments.  No documents were submitted. The transcript was received on December \n29, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations and denies all of the allegations under Guideline \nE, Personal Conduct.  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed with his company since October \n2007. He has a high school diploma, some college and technical school credit. He is \nseparated from his wife and has a son, age 13. (Tr at 5, 19-20; Gov 1.)  \n \nOn June 1, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in order to apply for a security clearance.

(Gov 1.)  \n \nA subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant has the following \ndelinquent accounts: a $2,263 judgment entered against Applicant in 1997 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: \nGov 2 at 3); a $53 cable television bill placed for collection in August 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: \nGov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 4); a $30 medical account placed for collection in September 2005 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 4 at 2); a $635 account placed for collection in September 2005 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 14; Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 11); a $2,360 account placed for collection in \nNovember 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 at 9; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 6); a $1,637 electronic \nstore account placed for collection in November 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 4 at 3); a $450 \njudgment for a medical account entered against Applicant in January 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: \nGov 2 at 4); and a $940 account placed for collection in January 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov \n4 at 3). \n \nAdditional delinquent debts include: an $830 account placed for collection in May \n2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 4 at 3); a $945 credit card account placed for collection in June \n2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 2 at 10; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 3); a $1,364 jewelry \nstore account placed for collection in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 2 at 12; Gov 3 at 5; \nGov 4 at 2-3; Gov 5 at 10); a $100 credit union account for collection in August 2006 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 2 at 10; Gov 3 at 5; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 4); a $1,345 credit card \naccount placed for collection in December 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 2 at 13; Gov 3 at 6; \nGov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 10); a $3,488 account that is delinquent since January 2007 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.n: Gov 2 at 3; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 4); and a $460 account placed for collection in \nMarch 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.o: Gov 2 at 14; Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 5, 11). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAdditional delinquent debts include: a $2,370 account placed for collection in \nMay 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.p: Gov 2 at 11; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 8-9); a $1,381 account placed \nfor collection in May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.q: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 3, 10, 12); a $1,681 account \nowed after a vehicle was repossessed in May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.r: Gov 2 at 11; Gov 3 at 5;  \nGov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 8); a $350 medical account placed for collection in May 2007 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.s: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 10); a $266 medical account placed for collection in June \n2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.t: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 11); a $150 medical account placed for collection \nin June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.u: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 11); a $150 medical account placed for \ncollection in June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.v: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 11); a $150 medical account \nplaced for collection in June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.w: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 11); a $150 medical \naccount placed for collection in June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.x: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 12); and a \n$407 medical account placed for collection in June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.u: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 \nat 12). \n \nApplicant \nexperienced \nfinancial \nproblems \ndue \nto \nseveral \nperiods \nof \nunemployment or underemployment. He was unemployed in 1995. He was unemployed \nbetween December 2006 and April 2007. He was unemployed between August 2007 to \nOctober 2007. (Tr at 21.)  \n \nApplicant and his wife are in the process of a divorce.  They separated two years \nago. Applicant has custody of his son. His son was diagnosed with a mental disorder. \nHe was in a residential facility for awhile but now lives with Applicant.  In 2005, \nApplicant\u2019s hours were reduced to 24 hours a week. Part of the reason for the reduction \nin his hours was Applicant needed to care for his son. (Tr at 19-22; 29.)   \n \nOn October 17, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator pursuant to \nhis background investigation. He told the investigator that he had plans to pay off all of \nhis debts by June 2008. (Gov 3.)  \n \nAt hearing, Applicant stated that he intends to resolve his delinquent accounts. \nHe notified his creditors when he was unemployed. He has been continuously employed \nsince October 2007. He has not made any payments towards his delinquent accounts. . \nHe has not attended financial counseling. He received some settlement offers from his \ncreditors but has not made any repayment agreements yet. (Tr at 23-25.)  He thinks the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, a $53 cable bill, was paid. He has a current account with the \nsame company. The record was held open to allow him to submit documentation \nverifying that this debt was paid in full. (Tr at 28.) No additional documents were \nsubmitted. He has not paid any of the other debts. (Tr at 29.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s car was repossessed last year because he was not able to maintain \nthe payments on the car loan. His wife supports herself. She takes no responsibility for \nany of the debts. (Tr at 31-32.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly take home pay is approximately $2,732. His mortgage is \n$1,087. Other expenses include utilities $120, car insurance $40, cable television $60; \nphone $100; groceries $400, son\u2019s medicine $60. His total monthly expenses are \n\n \n4 \n \n \n$1,867. Provided the figures Applicant gave during the hearing are accurate, after \nexpenses, he has approximately $865 left over each month. He testified that he had \napproximately $500 left over each month after expenses. (Tr at 26, 33-36.) When he \nwas interviewed in October 2007 pursuant to his background investigation, the numbers \nprovided for his income and expenses indicated that he has approximately $550 left \nover each month after expenses. (Gov 3 at 7-8.) \n \nApplicant has no open credit card accounts. He is current on federal and state \ntaxes. He never considered filing for bankruptcy. He thinks he will be able to pay his \ndebts in the future as long as he remains employed. (Tr at 36-37.)     \n \nApplicant states that he had no intent to deceive the government when he \ncompleted his security clearance application (e-QIP). He thought questions 28(a) and \n28(b) were referring to active delinquent accounts as opposed to accounts that were \nseveral years old. He learned a lesson and intends to list all of his delinquent accounts \non future security clearance applications. (Tr at 40-41.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has encountered financial \ndifficulty since 2004. The SOR alleged 25 delinquent accounts, an approximate total \nbalance of $23,955. \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. One of his accounts was placed in \ncollection status as recently as May 2007. He has not begun to resolve his delinquent \naccounts. His financial problems are ongoing. \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to Applicant\u2019s several \nperiods of unemployment from 2005 to 2007. He and his wife are in the process of filing \nfor divorce. His son\u2019s medical issues caused a further financial strain on his finances. \nHowever, he has been continuously employed since October 2007. He has not taken \nsteps to resolve his delinquent accounts even though he has approximately $500 left \neach month after expenses that he could apply towards his delinquent accounts. While \nApplicant has had some challenging times over the past four years, I cannot conclude \nthat he has acted responsibly under the circumstances because he has not taken steps  \nto resolve his delinquent accounts. He was on notice that his delinquent accounts would \nbe an issue by at least October 2007 when he was interviewed during his background \ninvestigation. He told the investigator that he had a plan to resolve all of the delinquent \naccounts by June 2008. As of December 2008, Applicant presented no plan for paying \nhis delinquent accounts during the hearing. For this reason, this mitigating condition is \ngiven less weight.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. It would be \nhelpful for him to do so in order to develop a plan to resolve his delinquent accounts.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. While Applicant intends to resolve \nhis delinquent accounts, he has taken no action to resolve any of the accounts. Though \nhe claims that he resolved the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, he provided no proof that the \ndebt was resolved. Applicant did not make a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent \naccounts.   \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  Guideline F \nis found against Applicant.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his  \nfinancial delinquencies in response to sections 28(a) and 28(b) on his security \nclearance application, dated June 1, 2007.  \n \n  \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies in \nApplicant\u2019s case. For PC DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission of his judgments and \ndelinquent accounts must be done with a deliberate intent to deceive. I find Applicant \ndid not deliberately intend to falsify his security clearance application. He misunderstood \nthe question. He believed that he was required to list his recent financial delinquencies \nas opposed to older debts. He has learned a lesson and intends to disclose his \ndelinquent accounts on future security clearance applications. I find his explanation \ncredible.  \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern is found for Applicant.  \n \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While Applicant has had \ncircumstances that were beyond his control which contributed to his financial problems, \nhe has been continuously employed for over 14 months and has no plan in place to \nresolve his delinquent accounts even though he has $500 in discretionary funds left \nover each month after expenses. It is too soon to conclude that his financial issues have \nbeen resolved due to the significant amount of his unresolved delinquent debt and the \nlack of action taken towards resolving the accounts on his part. He did not mitigate the \nconcerns raised under financial considerations. Personal conduct concerns are \nmitigated because Applicant did not intend to falsify his security clearance application. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.x:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.y:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlfred S. Donau, III, Esq.\n\nThe Judge made formal findings in favor of Applicant under Guideline E. Those favorable findings are not at\n1\nissue on appeal.\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 30, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 18, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the Judge\u2019s characterization of\nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use as \u201cextensive\u201d is supported by the record evidence; (2) whether the\nJudge\u2019s analysis of the Guideline H mitigating conditions is erroneous; and (3) whether the Judge\nmisapplied the whole-person concept.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable decision.  \n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: (a) Applicant was 55 years old at\nthe time of the hearing; (b) Applicant started smoking marijuana in college, and then did not smoke\nmarijuana for an extended period; (c) he smoked marijuana again during the period between about\n1992 and 1993, when he did not have a clearance; (d) he did not smoke marijuana between 1993 and\nMay 2005; (e) Applicant smoked marijuana on 25 to 30 occasions between May 2005 and April\n2006, using it every weekend or two during a month; (f) Applicant had a security clearance while\nhe was using marijuana in 2005 and 2006, and he was aware of his company\u2019s anti-drug policy, as\nwell as the DoD\u2019s policy against illegal drug use; (g) Applicant was stopped by his facility\u2019s security\nofficers for a random vehicle inspection on May 1, 2006; (h) the facility officers found a small\namount of marijuana inside a wooden case; (i) Applicant was arrested for unlawful possession of\nmarijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia; (j) Applicant pled guilty to possession of drug\nparaphernalia, entered a diversion program, completed the program, and the charges were dismissed;\n(k) Applicant signed a \u201clast chance\u201d agreement with his employer on June 5, 2006; (l) Applicant\nsuccessfully completed an outpatient chemical dependency program from May 3, 2006 through June\n21, 2006; (m) the discharge summary listed a diagnostic impression of cannabis dependence and a\nfavorable prognosis; (n) Applicant states that he will not use illegal drugs again and he has\ndisassociated himself from any drug-using associates and contacts; and (o) three witnesses attest to\nApplicant\u2019s job performance, reliability, honesty, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions: (i) there is no bright-line rule as to whether\nconduct is recent, and Applicant has not used illegal drugs in more than three years; (ii) however,\nhis drug use was very extensive, occurred over a long period of time, and was interrupted by other\nlong periods of abstinence followed by additional drug use; (iii) Applicant returned to illegal drug\nuse when he was 50 years old and held a security clearance; (iv) he used the drug knowing it was\nillegal, contrary to his company\u2019s anti-drug policy, and counter to the DoD\u2019s policy against illegal\n\n3\ndrug use; (v) the Judge was unable to make a determination that Applicant\u2019s drug use is completely\nin his past; (vi) security concerns are still present despite the presence of some mitigation.\nApplicant\u2019s reliance on portions of the Adjudicative Desk Reference (ADF) is misplaced.\nDOHA judges are required to decide cases by using the Adjudicative Guidelines, not the ADF.  The\nADF itself contains language indicating that it may not be cited as authority for denial or suspension\nof access.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 03-04090 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2005).  Given that language,\nApplicant cannot reasonably contend that the portions of the ADF cited by him constituted official\nU.S. government policy that the Judge was required to follow.\nApplicant asserts that Applicant\u2019s drug use was not extensive.  His assertion fails to\ndemonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  The record demonstrates that Applicant went through\nsignificant periods of marijuana use juxtaposed with significant periods of abstinence.  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  Although the record is not clear as to how many times\nApplicant used marijuana during his college years and during the period between 1992 and 1993,\nthese periods of usage, coupled with the 25-30 instances of use admitted to by Applicant during the\n2005-2006 time frame, reasonably support the Judge\u2019s characterization of Applicant\u2019s drug use as\nextensive.  The level of usage established by the evidence, in addition to a pattern of usage that\nstretched, with breaks, over a 30-year period, undercuts Applicant\u2019s characterization of his marijuana\nuse as an aberration.\nApplicant\u2019s statements concerning the Guideline H mitigating conditions and the whole-\nperson concept can be discussed together.  Applicant argues that proper application of Guideline H\nmitigating conditions should have resulted in a decision in his favor.  Specifically, Applicant\nmaintains that the three-year passage of time since his last marijuana use and the evidence of\nrehabilitation overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  He also emphasizes his successful\ncompletion of a drug rehabilitation program and the maturity and responsible behavior he\ndemonstrated by immediately reporting the May 1, 2006 incident to his supervisor when arguing that\nthe Judge misapplied the whole-person concept.  A review of the record and the Judge\u2019s decision\nreveals that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length,\nseriousness, and pattern of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The Judge  reasonably explained why the\nevidence Applicant presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  In doing so, the Judge emphasized the fact that Applicant\u2019s position as an intelligent,\nmature, and highly-regarded engineer made his choice to return to illegal drug use at the age of 50,\nand while holding a security clearance, particularly disturbing.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes\nthat the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his\ndecision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfs.

He stated that he did \nnot smoke marijuana between 1993 and May 2005, when he started smoking marijuana \nagain. He estimated that he smoked marijuana on about 25 to 30 occasions between \nMay 2005 and April 2006. He testified that he smoked marijuana on the weekends, \n\u201cbasically every weekend or two during a month.\u201d Applicant had a security clearance \nwhile he was using marijuana in 2005 and 2006. He was aware of his company\u2019s anti-\ndrug policy, as well as the DoD\u2019s position against illegal drug use. He purchased the \nmarijuana he used from a man he met at a bar.2 \n \n \nApplicant was driving to work on May 1, 2006. He was stopped by the facility\u2019s \nsecurity officers for a random vehicle inspection as he entered the facility. The officers \nfound a small amount of marijuana inside a wooden case. Applicant was arrested for \nunlawful possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. He pled guilty \nto possession of drug paraphernalia. He entered a diversion program. He completed the \nprogram, and the charges were dismissed.3  \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 23-27, 44-45, 67-68; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 33-36, 44-47, 57, 62-63, 68; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-5; AE A. \n \n3 Tr. at 29-32, 57-59; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4; AE D. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s employer was informed about the incident at the gate, the \ncompany directed him to take a urinalysis drug test on May 1, 2006. He tested positive \nfor the metabolites of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana. \nHis company suspended him without pay for 30 days. He was also denied salary raises \nand bonuses for two years.4  \n \n \nApplicant signed a \u201cLast Chance Agreement\u201d with his employer on June 5, 2006. \nUnder the terms of the agreement, Applicant agreed to participate in the company\u2019s \ncounseling/rehabilitation program. He agreed to submit to unscheduled drug and/or \nalcohol testing at any time up to 24 months from the date of the agreement. He also \nagreed that his employment was conditioned on him remaining drug-free.5  \n \n \nApplicant attended an outpatient chemical dependency program three days each \nweek from about May 3, 2006, through June 21, 2006. He successfully completed the \nprogram. The discharge summary, signed by a licensed independent substance abuse \ncounselor (LISAC), listed a diagnostic impression of cannabis dependence. The \nprognosis was good. The LISAC wrote in a letter dated June 16, 2006, that Applicant \nhad been quite cooperative in group and helpful to other group members. She wrote \nthat his prognosis was favorable. He completed six months of aftercare. He also \nattended Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings. He has taken a number of drug tests \nafter the incident. Other than the original positive test taken on May 1, 2006, he has \nnever tested positive.6  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s company detailed his arrest in an adverse information report \nsubmitted to the Defense Security Service (DSS). Applicant discussed his arrest and \nmarijuana use during an interview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator on June 21, 2007. He told the investigator that he smoked marijuana on an \nestimated basis of twice weekly to twice monthly from May 2005 through April 2006.7 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he will not use illegal drugs again. He has dissociated \nhimself from any drug-using associates and contacts. His wife is a noted scientist. She \nis vehemently opposed to illegal drug use, and putting foreign substances and toxins in \nthe body. Applicant signed an affidavit stating that if clear and convincing evidence of \nfuture illegal drug use is established, he would voluntarily and without further process \ngive up his security clearance.8 \n \n \nApplicant submitted Questionnaires for National Security Positions (SF 86) on \nApril 24, 2007, and again on August 8, 2008. The answers on both SF 86s were \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 29, 72; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4; AE G. \n \n5 Tr. at 31-33, 36-37, 63; AE F.  \n \n6 Tr. at 33-34, 65-67; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE B, E. \n \n7 GE 3, 4. \n \n8 Tr. at 25-26, 35, 43, 53; AE H.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nconsistent. He listed his arrest for possession of paraphernalia in May 2006, on both SF \n86s. He also listed his marijuana use between 2005 and 2006. He listed that he had a \nsecurity clearance since 1996. Question 24b asked: \n \nHave you ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a \nlaw enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while \npossessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and \nimmediately affecting the public safety?9 \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d on both SF 86s. He misread the question. He provided the \nrequested information elsewhere on both questionnaires.10 There was no intent to falsify \nthat question on the SF 86s. \n \n \nThree witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. His job performance has been \noutstanding. They are completely aware of Applicant\u2019s drug use. They do not question \nhis reliability, honesty, trustworthiness, or good judgment. They recommend that he \nretain his security clearance. Applicant also submitted numerous awards and \ncertificates attesting to his outstanding job performance.11  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \n                                                          \n9 GE 1, 2. \n \n10 Tr. at 39-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2 \n \n11 Tr. at 71-81; AE C. \n\n \n5 \n \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Six are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence;  \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; and \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana while holding a security clearance. He \ntested positive for the metabolites of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), 25(b), 25(c), and 25(g) are applicable as disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant received a diagnosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional of drug abuse or drug dependence. AG \u00b6 25(d) is not applicable. \nThe discharge summary from Applicant\u2019s outpatient chemical dependency program, \nsigned by a licensed independent substance abuse counselor, listed a diagnostic \nimpression of cannabis dependence. That is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 25(e) for \nconsideration as a disqualifying condition.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges marijuana use that is also alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. SOR \n\u00b6 1.b is concluded for Applicant. \n \nThree Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \n\n \n7 \n \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \n \n \nApplicant started smoking marijuana while in college. He quit using marijuana \nuntil he left his job in 1992. His new job did not require a security clearance. He smoked \nmarijuana on several occasions in about 1992 and 1993. Applicant would have been \nabout 38 to 39 years old at the time. He quit again until 2005, when he was about 50 \nyears old. He smoked marijuana regularly while holding a security clearance, until he \nwas caught with marijuana in his car on May 1, 2006, while entering his company\u2019s \nfacility. After he was caught, Applicant completed a drug treatment program and his \naftercare requirements. The licensed independent substance abuse counselor gave him \na favorable prognosis. He has dissociated himself from his drug-using associates and \ncontacts. There is no evidence of any drug abuse since May 2006. He signed what \namounts to a statement of intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b) and 26(d) are applicable.  \n \n \nThere is no bright-line rule as to whether conduct is recent. Applicant has not \nused illegal drugs in more than three years. However, his drug use was very extensive; \noccurred over a long period of time; and was interrupted by other long periods of \nabstinence followed by additional drug use. Applicant returned to illegal drug use when \nhe was 50 years old and held a security clearance. He knew it was illegal, against his \ncompany\u2019s anti-drug policy, and counter to the DoD\u2019s position against illegal drug use. \nHe also did it knowing that his wife was vehemently opposed to illegal drug use. I am \nunable to make a determination that illegal drug use is completely in his past. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) is not applicable.  \n \n \nIn sum, I conclude that security concerns are still present despite the presence of \nsome mitigation.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following mitigating condition is potentially applicable:   \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \n\n \n8 \n \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant incorrectly answered the same question on two Questionnaires for \nNational Security Positions. However, as discussed above, the requested information \nwas provided elsewhere on the questionnaires. There was no intent to deceive or \nmislead. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b are concluded for Applicant.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is an intelligent, mature, highly-regarded engineer for a defense contractor. \nThat makes his choice to return to illegal drug use at the age of 50, while holding a \nsecurity clearance, all the more disturbing. His drug use was halted when he was \narrested with drugs in his possession, while entering his company\u2019s facility in May 2006. \nSince then, he has checked all the boxes to attempt to establish that he is drug-free and \ntrustworthy. However, he has gone long periods in the past without abusing illegal \ndrugs, and then returned to drug use. I am not convinced that he will not return again to \nillegal drug use. Moreover, even if Applicant never uses illegal drugs again, his illegal \ndrug use while holding a security clearance, knowing it was illegal, counter to his \ncompany\u2019s and DoD\u2019s policy, and against his wife\u2019s wishes, raises serious doubts about \nhis judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Three plus years of abstinence does not \nmitigate his numerous incidents of extremely poor judgment, disregard for the law, and \nviolation of the trust placed in him while holding a security clearance.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated Personal Conduct concerns, but he has not mitigated Drug \nInvolvement security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph1.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlfred S. Donau, III, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 30, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 18, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nThe Judge made formal findings in favor of Applicant under Guideline E. Those favorable findings are not at\n1\nissue on appeal.\n2\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the Judge\u2019s characterization of\nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use as \u201cextensive\u201d is supported by the record evidence; (2) whether the\nJudge\u2019s analysis of the Guideline H mitigating conditions is erroneous; and (3) whether the Judge\nmisapplied the whole-person concept.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable decision.  \n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: (a) Applicant was 55 years old at\nthe time of the hearing; (b) Applicant started smoking marijuana in college, and then did not smoke\nmarijuana for an extended period; (c) he smoked marijuana again during the period between about\n1992 and 1993, when he did not have a clearance; (d) he did not smoke marijuana between 1993 and\nMay 2005; (e) Applicant smoked marijuana on 25 to 30 occasions between May 2005 and April\n2006, using it every weekend or two during a month; (f) Applicant had a security clearance while\nhe was using marijuana in 2005 and 2006, and he was aware of his company\u2019s anti-drug policy, as\nwell as the DoD\u2019s policy against illegal drug use; (g) Applicant was stopped by his facility\u2019s security\nofficers for a random vehicle inspection on May 1, 2006; (h) the facility officers found a small\namount of marijuana inside a wooden case; (i) Applicant was arrested for unlawful possession of\nmarijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia; (j) Applicant pled guilty to possession of drug\nparaphernalia, entered a diversion program, completed the program, and the charges were dismissed;\n(k) Applicant signed a \u201clast chance\u201d agreement with his employer on June 5, 2006; (l) Applicant\nsuccessfully completed an outpatient chemical dependency program from May 3, 2006 through June\n21, 2006; (m) the discharge summary listed a diagnostic impression of cannabis dependence and a\nfavorable prognosis; (n) Applicant states that he will not use illegal drugs again and he has\ndisassociated himself from any drug-using associates and contacts; and (o) three witnesses attest to\nApplicant\u2019s job performance, reliability, honesty, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions: (i) there is no bright-line rule as to whether\nconduct is recent, and Applicant has not used illegal drugs in more than three years; (ii) however,\nhis drug use was very extensive, occurred over a long period of time, and was interrupted by other\nlong periods of abstinence followed by additional drug use; (iii) Applicant returned to illegal drug\nuse when he was 50 years old and held a security clearance; (iv) he used the drug knowing it was\nillegal, contrary to his company\u2019s anti-drug policy, and counter to the DoD\u2019s policy against illegal\ndrug use; (v) the Judge was unable to make a determination that Applicant\u2019s drug use is completely\nin his past; (vi) security concerns are still present despite the presence of some mitigation.\nApplicant\u2019s reliance on portions of the Adjudicative Desk Reference (ADF) is misplaced.\nDOHA judges are required to decide cases by using the Adjudicative Guidelines, not the ADF.  The\nADF itself contains language indicating that it may not be cited as authority for denial or suspension\nof access.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 03-04090 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2005).  Given that language,\nApplicant cannot reasonably contend that the portions of the ADF cited by him constituted official\nU.S. government policy that the Judge was required to follow.\n\n3\nApplicant asserts that Applicant\u2019s drug use was not extensive.  His assertion fails to\ndemonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  The record demonstrates that Applicant went through\nsignificant periods of marijuana use juxtaposed with significant periods of abstinence.  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  Although the record is not clear as to how many times\nApplicant used marijuana during his college years and during the period between 1992 and 1993,\nthese periods of usage, coupled with the 25-30 instances of use admitted to by Applicant during the\n2005-2006 time frame, reasonably support the Judge\u2019s characterization of Applicant\u2019s drug use as\nextensive.  The level of usage established by the evidence, in addition to a pattern of usage that\nstretched, with breaks, over a 30-year period, undercuts Applicant\u2019s characterization of his marijuana\nuse as an aberration.\nApplicant\u2019s statements concerning the Guideline H mitigating conditions and the whole-\nperson concept can be discussed together.  Applicant argues that proper application of Guideline H\nmitigating conditions should have resulted in a decision in his favor.  Specifically, Applicant\nmaintains that the three-year passage of time since his last marijuana use and the evidence of\nrehabilitation overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  He also emphasizes his successful\ncompletion of a drug rehabilitation program and the maturity and responsible behavior he\ndemonstrated by immediately reporting the May 1, 2006 incident to his supervisor when arguing that\nthe Judge misapplied the whole-person concept.  A review of the record and the Judge\u2019s decision\nreveals that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length,\nseriousness, and pattern of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The Judge  reasonably explained why the\nevidence Applicant presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  In doing so, the Judge emphasized the fact that Applicant\u2019s position as an intelligent,\nmature, and highly-regarded engineer made his choice to return to illegal drug use at the age of 50,\nand while holding a security clearance, particularly disturbing.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes\nthat the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his\ndecision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfs.

On October 3, 2008, acting under the \nrelevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \napproved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nJuly 22, 2009\n\n \n \n \n2\nconcerns under financial considerations, based on a history of financial problems as \nevidenced by delinquent debts.  \n  \n \nOn October 17, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. \nOn March 10, 2009, I was assigned the case. On March 26, 2009, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on April 22, 2009. The government offered \nExhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified and \nsubmitted Exhibits A and B, which were admitted into evidence.  \n \nThe record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. On \nApril 27, 2009, May 1, 2009, May 27, 2009, and July 2, 2009, additional documents \nwere received. There being no objection, the material was admitted into evidence as Ex. \nC through Ex. F. On April 30, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($708). \nShe admitted owing the other three debts, which total approximately $34,000. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough \nreview of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old administrative specialist who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since May 2007, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Prior to her \ncurrent job, she worked a couple of months at a day school. (Tr. 31) From July 2006 \nthrough February 2007, she was unemployed. (Tr. 31)  \n \n \nIn May 2005, Applicant and her husband married, although they lived together \nand shared expenses starting in college in 1999. They have no children. Applicant\u2019s \nyearly income is $38,000 and her husband\u2019s yearly income is $72,000. (Tr. 28) He is an \nelectrical engineer. Her net monthly salary is approximately $2,000 and her husband\u2019s \nis $3,800. (Tr. 34) In December 2005, they purchased a $154,000 home on which they \nhave a $1,400 monthly mortgage. (Ex. C) The fair market value of the home is \n$164,500. (Ex. C) They have a 2002 pick-up truck which is paid for and make $650 \npayments on a vehicle purchased new in 2007. She has additional credit cards with a \nbalance of $1,000. (Tr. 38)  \n \nApproximately a year and a half ago, Applicant took out a $10,000 loan to pay \ntaxes. She makes monthly $200 payments to repay the loan. (Tr. 39) Applicant has not \nbeen late on any of her current obligations including her mortgage, car payment, credit \ncard payments, or utility payments. (Tr. 39) Applicant is not being contacted by creditors \nconcerning unpaid debts. (Tr. 43)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband has a credit card with a $2,000 balance and a second card \nwith a balance of $5,000, which was used to payoff a number of little debts. (Tr. 40) Her \nhusband pays $500 monthly on his student loans. (Tr. 41) Applicant has paid off her \n\n \n \n \n3\nstudent loans. (Ex. 4, Ex B) Her husband has $8,200 in his thrift savings plan (TSP) \naccount and $2,700 in an IRA. (Ex. C) Applicant has $3,000 in her 401(k) retirement \nplan. (Tr. 42, Ex. C)  \n \n \nApproximately nine or ten years ago, Applicant incurred credit card debt. From \nSeptember 1997 though December 1999, Applicant attended college. Her husband was \na full-time student at the same time. They were 21 or 22 years old at the time. While her \nhusband was a full-time college student, they lived on her part-time income and credit \ncards. (Ex. 4) The credit cards were used to buy food, gas, and were her means of \nmeeting daily living expenses. (Tr. 22) Applicant acknowledges she and her husband \nacted irresponsibly and showed very poor judgment in using their credit cards as they \ndid. (Tr. 22)  \n \nThe largest unpaid debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a, $27,708) is a past due credit card debt, \nwhich had a credit limit of $10,000. (Tr.23) Applicant moved the balance from two other \ncredit cards onto this account. (Tr. 32) Applicant had been paying $600 per month on \nthis debt, but the balance was not being reduced. (Ex. 4) In 2001, she stopped making \npayments on the card. (Tr. 32) Following the transfer of the balance to this credit card, \nshe kept the other two cards for emergency use. Eventually, additional charges were \nmade on the other two cards (SOR \u00b6 1.c, $2,788 and SOR \u00b6 1.d, $3,531). (Tr. 32) The \ncredit limit on the two additional cards was $1,000 each. Late payment fees, overage \nfees, interest and other expenses have increased the three past due accounts to \n$27,708, $2,788, and $3,531. \n \n \nThe two smaller credit card debts are with the same creditor. The creditor offered \nto settle the debts for $2,091 and $2,657, which was 75% of the debt. (Ex. 3) However, \nthe creditor required a lump-sum payment. (Tr. 23) In May 2008, when Applicant \nanswered written interrogatories, she stated she was saving to settle the debt with a \none-time payment. (Ex. 3) In April 2009, unable to make a lump-sum payment she \nstarted making $50 monthly payments on each of these accounts. (Ex. A, Ex. E, Ex. F) \nShe also started making $50 on the other credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a, $27,708), the \nlargest of her three past-due debts. (Ex. D, Ex. F) Since April 2009, she has paid $400 \non the three debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d), which total more than $34,000. \n \n \nApplicant disputes the $708 charged off account (SOR \u00b6 1.b). She did not \nchallenge the debt with the credit bureau reporting agencies because it did not appear \non her May 2009 credit bureau report (CBR). (Tr. 34, Ex. B) She has been unsuccessful \nin contacting the holder of the remaining obligation. (Tr. 21) In response to the written \ninterrogatories, Applicant stated this was not her account and had been falsely reported \non her CBR. \n \nApplicant also suffered from severe migraines and did not have medical \ninsurance. (Tr. 27) Some of the medical bills went unpaid until Applicant started her \nsecurity clearance process. The medical bills have been paid. (Tr. 27) Applicant and her \nhusband are very concerned the unpaid debts may result in Applicant losing her job. \n(Tr. 29)  \n\n \n \n \n4\n \nApplicant and her husband were able to pay off a number of past due obligations \nnot listed on the SOR. In May 2008, when Applicant answered written interrogatories, \nshe provided proof she had paid eight debts totaling approximately $2,000. (Ex. 3) \nThese eight accounts were not listed on the SOR. The written interrogatories did ask \nher about the three credit card debts included in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s April 2009 CBR \nlists Applicant \u201cpays as agreed\u201d on seven accounts and three additional accounts that \nwere closed were also listed as \u201cpaid as agreed.\u201d  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n\n \n \n \n5\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Nine or ten years ago, when in college, Applicant\u2014then age 20 or 21\u2014used \ncredit cards for living expenses. She has three credit card accounts totaling $34,000 \nthat were past due. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n \n \n6\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant incurred the three unpaid credit card obligations nine or ten years ago \nmaking the behavior infrequent and not recent. Until 2001, she was making $600 \nmonthly payments on the largest account. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply, however, \nbecause her failing to pay her credit card obligation in a timely manner does some cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nAG & 20(b) does not apply because living on one\u2019s credit cards is not an event or \ncondition beyond her control. AG & 20(c) applies in part. Even though Applicant has not \nreceived financial counseling, there is a clear indication her financial problems are being \nresolved. In May 2008, Applicant provided proof she had paid eight accounts totaling \napproximately $2,000. Her April 2009 CBR indicates she is currently paying as agreed \nseven accounts and had three additional, now closed accounts which were also \u201cpaid \nas agreed.\u201d She is paying her mortgage, car payment, current credit card accounts, and \nutilities in a timely manner. She is not being contacted by creditors.  \n \nAG & 20(d) applies. Applicant is making $50 monthly payments on her three old \ncredit card accounts. She has paid $400 on these accounts, which is not a large amount \nand the payments have been made for only three months, which is not an extensive \npayment history. However, she has been paying other accounts in a timely manner for a \nlonger period of time. She has paid her student loan and other debts not listed in the \nSOR. It is the debts she has already paid, and the payments she makes on other \naccounts and debts, which leads me to believe she will continue her payments on the \nthree accounts listed in the SOR.  \n \nApplicant did not dispute the final debt alleging $700 being past due because the \naccount does not appear on her current CBR. One cannot dispute an account if it does \n\n \n \n \n7\nnot appear on the CBR. Her denial of responsibility for this debt is credible. The size of \nthe obligation is such that it does not raise concerns about her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant acknowledges she acted \ninappropriately when she used her credit cards to pay living expenses. However, these \ndebts were incurred when she was 20 or 21 years old and she is now 31 years old. She \nis more mature and handles her finances in a more mature manner. She no longer uses \nher credit cards to pay living expenses. She and her husband make approximately \n$110,000 a year, are homeowners, and pay their bills as agreed. They have adequate \nretirement funds available should they experience significant financial problems in the \nfuture.  \n \nBoth Applicant and her husband are keenly aware how serious it is to adequately \naddress their past due obligations. Applicant realizes the impact her finances can have \non her employment. Even though her track record in addressing the three past due \ncredit card accounts is not lengthy, she has a favorable record in paying other accounts \nin a timely manner. \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \n\n \n \n \n8\nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

On March 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating security concerns under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response dated May 31, 2008, Applicant admitted four of the eleven\nallegations raised. The case was forwarded to DOHA for referral to an Administrative\nJudge. I was assigned the case on July 10, 2008. The parties agreed to a hearing date\nof August 13, 2008, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on July 17, 2008, to that effect.\nNovember 24, 2008\n\n Tr. 51.\n1\n Id.\n2\n See Ex. 1 (SF-86 Form, dated Apr. 23, 2007) at 2, 6.\n3\n Ex. 5 (Credit report, dated Apr. 29, 2008); the debt is noted in the SOR at \u00b6 1.f.\n4\n2\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted five\nexhibits (Ex.), admitted into the record as Exs. 1-5 without objection. Applicant\nsubmitted 24 exhibits, accepted as Exs. A-X without objection. Applicant gave\ntestimony. No witnesses were called. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 19,\n2008. Applicant was given through September 2, 2008, to submit any additional\nmaterials. On August 21, 2008, two additional documents were received from Applicant\nby facsimile transmission. They were admitted into the record without objection as Exs.\nY and Z. The record was closed on September 2, 2008. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 41-year-old security guard who has worked for the same defense\ncontractor since February 2007. He is divorced and has no children. Applicant received\na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2000. \nMarried in 1996, Applicant\u2019s marriage began to fail. As he went through the\nprocess of a divorce, he returned to college to finish his undergraduate degree.\nWanting to expedite his academic program, he became a full-time student and part-\ntime wage-earner.

This continued even after 2000, when the couple\u2019s divorce was granted and\nApplicant was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree.3\nApplicant moved to another region and began a new relationship. The\nrelationship did not work out and his debts continued to go unpaid. He filed for Chapter\n7 bankruptcy in September 2003 and his debts discharged in December 2003.\nIn May 2006, Applicant totaled a sports car. At the time, his car insurance was\nnot paid to date and he lacked coverage. The wrecked car was returned to the lender.\nThe account on this automobile was transferred to a credit collection agency in 2004.\nHis credit report shows an account balance of approximately $12,400 and a past due\nsum of about $9,820.

Applicant acknowledges he owes a debt on\n5\nthe car and is required to pay, but states that he does not \u201chave the money to do so.\u201d6\nAlthough he has no children of his own, he has five young nieces. Over the past\nfew years, Applicant has \u201csent a good portion of money to them to help out.\u201d  He has\n7\nrecently considered \u201cspending a little more time taking care of [his] own affairs.\u201d8\nSince the bankruptcy, other delinquent debts have been acquired. As noted in\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports from 2007 and 2008:\nSTUDENT LOAN \u2013 $366 delinquency noted at SOR \u00b6 1.b. -\u2013 Applicant was under the\nassumption that, pursuant to his bankruptcy, his student loans were to be paid off by\napplication of his tax refunds. Applicant failed to show any portions of his bankruptcy\npaperwork that would corroborate this, but he did show that he has paid $25 on the\naccount.9\nGROCERY STORE \u2013 $71 returned check, noted at SOR \u00b6 1.c. \u2013 Applicant states that\nhe repaid this merchant in 2003, but offered no evidence of that payment. He did show\na payment of $25 from August 2008.  This account is under dispute.\n10\nCOLLECTION ACCOUNT \u2013 $563, noted at SOR \u00b6 1.d. \u2013 Applicant does not recognize\nthis entry, but is willing to make inquiries with regard to the account entry.  He did,\n11\nhowever, pay $25 on the account in April 2008.12\nCOMMERCIAL BANK CREDIT CARD \u2013 $157, noted at SOR \u00b6 1.e. \u2013 Applicant wrote\nthis creditor in March 2008 to inquire as to whether this account is his, but never heard\nback from it.

No other action has been taken.\n14\nCOLLECTION ACCOUNT \u2013 $2,839, noted at SOR \u00b6 1.h. \u2013 Applicant is willing to make\ninquiries as to what this account is, but he does not recognize it.15\nLOAN ACCOUNT \u2013 $875, noted at SOR \u00b6 1.i. \u2013 Applicant made a $25 payment on this\naccount in August 2008 to show that he is \u201cmaking an effort to pay [it] off.\u201d  \n16\nCOLLECTION ACCOUNT \u2013 $287, noted at SOR \u00b6 1.j. \u2013 As above, a $25 payment was\nmade in August 2008 as a token of good faith.17\nBANK ACCOUNT \u2013 $878, noted at SOR \u00b6 1.k. \u2013 Applicant closed this account years\nago. He does not know why there is a balance. He wrote to the bank, but has not heard\nback from anyone.  There is no evidence he has tried to contact it in any other way.\n18\nApplicant presented little evidence of his present financial condition. He is a\nvalued employee. Applicant is noted as a superior professional and has received raises\nin salary for his work.  \n19\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n20\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n21\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n22\n Id.\n23\n Id.\n24\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n25\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n20\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n21\n22\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n23\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n24\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n25\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n26\n6\nAnalysis\nUnder GUIDELINE F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions\n26\nunder this guideline.  \nApplicant\u2019s debts were discharged in bankruptcy in December 2003 and he has\nacquired approximately $19,000 in new delinquent debt over the past five years. He has\nmade little progress in addressing this debt. He acknowledged he did not have the\nmoney to address his obligations when discussing his wrecked automobile. Such facts\nare sufficient to give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)\nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) apply. With such conditions raised, the\nburden shifts to Appellant to overcome the case against him and mitigate security\nconcerns. \nApplicant first acquired significant delinquent debt around 2000, when he\ncommenced divorce proceedings, returned to school full-time, and chose to live on\ncredit. With the exception of a minor ($366) student loan balance, he relieved himself of\nhis debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant failed, however, to cite to any\nparticularly significant events subsequent to his bankruptcy that might have helped\ncreate his current debt and invoke Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC\nMC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances).\nThe vast majority of the individual debts at issue were acquired within the past\nfive years, following Applicant\u2019s December 2003 bankruptcy discharge. This new wave\nof debt remains substantially unexplored and unpaid. Although Applicant states that he\ntakes responsibility for these debts, he provided no explanation or strategy as to how he\ncan or will honor them. Nor has he demonstrated any budget or plan to cease accruing\ndelinquent debt in the future. Consequently, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened\nso long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment) does not apply. \nApplicant paid three accounts a nominal $25 each in April 2008, prior to his\nreceipt of the SOR. Another three accounts received a similar amount in August 2008,\nafter Applicant received the SOR and shortly before the hearing. Moreover\n\n7\ncorrespondence with his creditors shows some initiative, but fails to demonstrate\ngenuine persistence or commitment. Other than those sporadic payments and a wave\nof dispute letters, little effort to address these obligations in an organized fashion has\nbeen demonstrated. While one can appreciate Applicant\u2019s limited financial resources,\nthat does not excuse his failure to follow through on his correspondence, make nominal\npayments with regularity, or address his debts in an alternative manner, such as either\nseeking consolidations or settlements, or soliciting the help of a financial counselor.\nUnder these facts, however, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply.\nFinally, Applicant failed to provide any evidence that he has received any form of\nmuch needed financial counseling. FC MC 3, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control) does not apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is an exceptionally affable and engaging man. He is mature and has\nconsiderable life experience. His testimony was direct and he was quick to take\nresponsibility for his debts. \nThe purpose of these hearings is to allow an Applicant the opportunity to come\nand present evidence of things that he or she has done to address his or her delinquent\naccounts and thereby show that he or she is financially responsible. While Applicant\nwas able to show that he is highly engaging, devoted to his nieces, and a valued\nemployee, he was unable to show much effort in addressing his delinquent debts,\nregaining his financial stability, or successfully living within a budget. Without significant\nevidence in those areas, it is impossible to verify Applicant\u2019s level of financial\nresponsibility or commitment. With security concerns left unmitigated, I conclude it is\nnot clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "findings of fact: Applicant was divorced from his first wife in June 2002 and pays child support for a child from that marriage. He remarried in May 2004. Applicant was unemployed between April and June 2004 and between September and December 2006. The periods of unemployment were partially responsible for Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, including a child support arrearage. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties were further exacerbated by his care for an ailing parent. Applicant\u2019s debts include credit card accounts, medical bills, the child support arrearage, a number of student loans, and a judgment associated with a car loan. When Applicant was given the opportunity to provide documentation of his efforts to address his outstanding debts, he demonstrated that he had significantly decreased the amount of his child support arrearage and consolidated his student loans into one account. However, Applicant did not provide evidence that he had resolved or disputed his other delinquent debts. Applicant argues that the government has not met its burden of proving that he should not be granted a security clearance. Applicant misstates the burden of proof. Under the Directive, the government presents evidence raising security concerns. Then the burden shifts to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the concerns.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nApplicant objects to the fact that the credit report offered into evidence by the government was dated\n1\nSeptember 2008 and contained information which was outdated by the date of the hearing, February 25, 2009.  The\nrecord was held open for Applicant to submit, and he did submit, a more recent credit report.  In his decision, the Judge\nreferred to the credit report Applicant submitted.  Applicant has not demonstrated error in this regard.   \n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 10, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On April 16, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert C. Wesley\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nOn appeal, Applicant raises the following issue: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Specifically, Applicant argues that the government did not meet its\nburden of proving that he should not be granted a security clearance; and he contends that the Judge\ncommitted error in not considering the evidence Applicant submitted and in not giving proper weight\nto Applicant\u2019s evidence of mitigation.  Finding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant was divorced from his\nfirst wife in June 2002 and pays child support for a child from that marriage.  He remarried in May\n2004.  Applicant was unemployed between April and June 2004 and between September and\nDecember 2006.  The periods of unemployment were partially responsible for Applicant\u2019s financial\ndifficulties, including a child support arrearage.  Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties were further\nexacerbated by his care for an ailing parent.  Applicant\u2019s debts include credit card accounts, medical\nbills, the child support arrearage, a number of student loans, and a judgment associated with a car\nloan.  When Applicant was given the opportunity to provide documentation of his efforts to address\nhis outstanding debts, he demonstrated that he had significantly decreased the amount of his child\nsupport arrearage and consolidated his student loans into one account.  However, Applicant did not\nprovide evidence that he had resolved or disputed his other delinquent debts.\nApplicant argues that the government has not met its burden of proving that he should not\nbe granted a security clearance.  Applicant misstates the burden of proof.  Under the Directive, the\ngovernment presents evidence raising security concerns.  Then the burden shifts to Applicant to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the concerns.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable security clearance decision rests with Applicant.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15; and ISCR Case\nNo. 06-20062 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 15, 2008).   In this case, an SOR was issued showing that Applicant\nowed delinquent debts.  In his response to the SOR, Applicant offered explanations of his attempts\nto resolve some of the debts.  For six of the debts, he responded that he had done nothing to resolve\nthem.  In effect, Applicant admitted many of the debts and thus established the government\u2019s case.\nThe burden then shifted to Applicant to explain or mitigate his financial difficulties.  \n1\n\nApplicant had testified that he had arranged for his multiple student loans to be consolidated  into one loan and\n2\nthat the payment amount had been reduced.  One of the documents Applicant submitted was related to that transaction.\nApplicant also argues that the Judge did not consider the whole person.  The Board notes that the Judge\u2019s\n3\ndecision explicitly discusses Applicant\u2019s debts in the context of the whole person.  Decision at 6. \n3\nApplicant also contends that the Judge did not consider the evidence he submitted and did\nnot give proper weight to his evidence of mitigation. When the record was held open after the\nhearing for Applicant to submit further documentation of his efforts to improve his financial\nsituation, he submitted a letter regarding his involvement at his child\u2019s school, pay statements\nshowing deductions pursuant to a court order, information regarding his student loans, and a credit\nreport.  Applicant believes that the Judge did not consider that documentation.  There is a rebuttable\npresumption that the Judge has considered all the evidence in a case unless the record clearly\ndemonstrates otherwise; and the Judge is not required to mention or discuss every piece of record\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-18303 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2008).  In this case, it is clear\nthat the Judge did consider the information Applicant submitted.  In the Analysis section of his\ndecision, the Judge stated that Applicant had taken steps to resolve his child support arrearage and\nstudent loans, and the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to the arrearage and all but one of the\nstudent loan items in the SOR.   Decision at 5, 6.  The Judge specifically referred to the credit report\n2\nApplicant provided in stating that the fact that some of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts no longer\nappeared on that credit report did not demonstrate resolution of those debts.  Id. at 3.\nApplicant argues that he has mitigated any security concerns which might exist under\nGuideline F and that the Judge did not give adequate weight to his evidence of mitigation.   The\n3\napplication of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Thus, the presence of\nsome mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security\ndetermination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence\nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-23384 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2007).     \nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against his financial history and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions and factors.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence Applicant had presented\nin mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.   The Board does not\nreview a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate\nthe Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01105\nat 2-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 15,  2008).  The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for his decision,  \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the\nchoice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant married his first spouse (W1) in October 1997 (see ex. 1). They divorced in June 2002 (ex. 1). He has one daughter (age 8) from this marriage. Applicant remarried in May 2004 (ex. 1; R.T., at 42). His current wife (W2) is enlisted in the Air Force (R.T., at 42). Applicant has one daughter (age 3) from his marriage to W2 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 72). For a two-month period between April 2004 and June 2004, Applicant was unemployed (R.T., at 43-44), and encountered difficulties in paying his debts. He was unemployed again in 2006 (September 2006 through December 2006), and with the added responsibility for caring for an ailing parent who never recovered and expired in 2007 (R.T., at 44-46, 74, 79, 86). With these added burdens, Applicant fell further behind with his debts. His debts include a number of personal credit card debts 3 (creditors 1.e through 1.f and 1.q through 1.t), medical accounts (creditors 1.a through 1.d, 1.t and 1.u), child support arrearage owed to W1 for their daughter, student loans associated with trade school training (creditors 1.k through 1.p), and a judgment entered against Applicant in July 2003 associated with a car loan that remains unsatisfied (see exs. 2 and 6",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn December 10, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, and\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 10, 2008, and requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on February 2, 2009, and was scheduled for\nhearing on February 25, 2009.  A hearing was held as scheduled, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of seven exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness\nApril 16, 2009\n\n2\n(himself) and one exhibit.  The transcript (R.T.) was received March 10, 2009.  Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with an updated credit report and documentation of a consolidated student loan,\npayroll deductions for child support, and endorsements. For good cause shown,\nApplicant was granted seven days to March 4, 2009 to supplement the record.  The\nGovernment was granted five days to  respond.  For good cause shown, Applicant was\ngranted two additional continuances to March 26, 2009 to supplement the record.\nWithin the time permitted, Applicant provided copies of an updated credit report, a cover\nletter from Applicant, an endorsement and pay statements.  Department counsel did not\nobject to the admission of the submissions.  The submissions were admitted as exhibits\nB through E.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated 21 delinquent\ndebts exceeding $30,000.00 (including six student loans totaling more than $20,000.00)\nand to (b) had a personal judgment entered against him in the amount of $359.00,\nwhich remains unsatisfied.  For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the\nallegations. He admitted the debts covered by subparagraphs 1.e, 1.g through 1.j, and\n1.q.  He denied the remaining 15 allegations without any explanations or affirmative\ndefenses. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old explosive transporter for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant married his first spouse (W1) in October 1997 (see ex. 1).  They\ndivorced in June 2002 (ex. 1).  He has one daughter (age 8) from this marriage.\nApplicant remarried in May 2004 (ex. 1; R.T., at 42).  His current wife (W2) is enlisted in\nthe Air Force (R.T., at 42).  Applicant has one daughter (age 3) from his marriage to W2\n(see ex. 1; R.T., at 72).\nFor a two-month period between April 2004 and June 2004, Applicant was\nunemployed (R.T., at 43-44), and encountered difficulties in paying his debts.  He was\nunemployed again in 2006 (September 2006 through December 2006), and with the\nadded responsibility for caring for an ailing parent who never recovered and expired in\n2007 (R.T., at 44-46, 74, 79, 86).  With these added burdens, Applicant fell further\nbehind with his debts.  His debts include a number of personal credit card debts\n\n3\n(creditors 1.e through 1.f and 1.q through 1.t), medical accounts (creditors 1.a through\n1.d, 1.t and 1.u), child support arrearage owed to W1 for their daughter, student loans\nassociated with trade school training (creditors 1.k through 1.p), and a judgment entered\nagainst Applicant in July 2003 associated with a car loan that remains unsatisfied (see\nexs. 2 and 6; R.T., at 85).\nApplicant attributes most of his delinquent debts to unemployment problems in\n2004 and 2006. He was able to document withholding from his weekly earnings\n($143.45) in accordance with a court order to cover his child support arrearage.  This\narrearage accumulated after Applicant relocated, became unemployed, and stopped\nmaking his ordered $517.00 monthly child support payments to W1 (R.T., at 90-92).\nApplicant\u2019s furnished earning statements through March 2009 show aggregate\npayments to date of $1,721.00 (see ex. E; R.T., at 76-77). \nApplicant also documented his claimed consolidation of his four listed student\nloans into one loan with a new monthly payment of $135.00 (see ex. A; R.T., at 51-62).\nHis updated credit report corroborates Applicant\u2019s claims that he student loans are now\nconsolidated and in current status (see ex. B). \nAfforded an opportunity to address his other outstanding debts and entered\njudgment by creditor 1.v, though, Applicant failed to provide any evidence of his\nresolving or disputing any of his remaining debts in collection, charge-off, or judgment\nstatus.  Still unresolved are the delinquent debts covered by creditors 1.a through 1.h\nand 1.q through 1.u, and  creditor 1.v (the judgment creditor).  That some of these\nnamed creditors no longer appear on Applicant\u2019s latest credit report is insufficient in and\nof itself to credit Applicant with resolution of the debts.  Each of these debts (including\nthe judgment debt) are reported in Appellant\u2019s September 2008 credit report (see ex. 6).\nAppellant is appreciated by members of his community for the active role he has\ntaken as a chaperone.  By all accounts, he is a responsible parent. \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\n\n4\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d Adjudication Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a responsible employee of a defense contractor who accumulated a\nnumber of delinquent debts during periods of unemployment following his divorce from\n\n5\nhis first wife. While some of his major debts are being satisfactorily addressed (e.g., his\nchild support arrearage and student loans), others have not been resolved.  Altogether,\n17 of his listed creditors (inclusive of his judgment creditor) remain unaddressed and\nunresolved.  Only his child support arrearage and student loans have been actively\nworked on.  And the payment history on these accounts is relatively recent and modest\nin overall repayment credits to date. \nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\ndelinquent debts and his past inability to pay these debts warrant the application of two\nof the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines DC \u00b6 19(a), inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts, and \u00b619(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to his divorce from W1 and periods in\n2004 and 2006 when he was out of work.  Faced with so many pressing challenges to\nmanage a new family, pay child support arrearage owed to W1, honor his student loans,\nand still manage the responsibilities he faces with his new spouse and young daughter,\nApplicant has plainly struggled to keep up.  His progress to date in regaining control of\nhis finances is improved, but far from complete.   His finances remain a work in progress\nthat require a good deal of effort on Applicant\u2019s part to fully stabilize them. \nBased on his evidentiary showing, extenuating circumstances are associated with\nApplicant\u2019s inability to take care of his past debts.  Available to Applicant is MC  \u00b6 20(b)\nof the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibility.\u201d  Albeit, some judgment problems persist over the\namounts he accumulated in back child support arrearage, student loans, his medical\naccounts, and his consumer-related debts without any tangible efforts to resolve once he\nreturned to a regular work schedule.  \nMitigation credit is only partially available to Applicant based on his limited\ndemonstration of good faith repayment efforts. The age of each of the covered debts is\ncovered by two of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations.  MC \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d has partial applicability, but is in no way dispositive\nunder the facts presented.  MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d has some limited application, too,\nunder all of the circumstances covered.  \n                                                    \n\n6\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the judgment\nquestions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debts.  Since his divorce and return\nto work following his last lay-off in 2006, he has not shown enough tangible effort in\naddressing all of his covered debts to mitigate his still delinquent debts and credit him\nwith restored control over his finances.  While Applicant provided some documentation of\nexhibited good judgment and trust in his community and work, he provided no\nendorsements from his supervisors, and no performance evaluations or other evidence\nof his company contributions to demonstrate his trust and reliability with his employer.  In\nbalance, whole person assessment does not enable Applicant to establish judgment and\ntrust levels sufficient to enable him to overcome appraised security concerns arising out\nhis accumulation of delinquent debts.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources he has had to address them with,\nthe limited steps he has mounted to address his old debts, it is still soon to make safe\npredictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his debts and restore his finances\nto stable levels commensurate with his holding a security clearance. \nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h, 1.j, and 1.q through 1.v.  Based on Applicant\u2019s proofs,\nfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.i and 1.l through 1.p.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSub-para. 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSub-para. 1;j :\nAgainst Applicant\nSub-paras. 1.I through 1.p:\nFor Applicant\nSub-paras. 1.r through 1.v:\nAgainst Applicant \n\n7\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Applicant is a 35-year-old software engineer employed by a major defense contractor. He has worked for his present employer and held a security clearance since 1996.

His father was a U.S. citizen working in Belgium, and his mother was a Belgian citizen. His birth was properly registered as a U.S. citizen born overseas. At the time he was not recognized as a Belgian citizen because their law only conferred citizenship along paternal lines.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Robert R. Bohn, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant is a dual-citizen willing to renounce his Belgian citizenship and had his\nforeign passport destroyed. He voted by mail in one foreign election. His wife was\nraised in China and her parents are citizens and resident there, although they recently\nreceived green cards and plan to move to the U.S. in the future. Applicant lived in\nTaiwan to learn Mandarin before meeting his wife. He mitigated foreign preference but\nnot foreign influence concerns. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing\n(e-QIP), on June 7, 2007, in connection with renewing the security clearance he has\nheld since 1996. On July 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guidelines B and C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 31, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing (AR) on August 27, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 23,\n2008, and the case was assigned to me on that same date. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on October 20, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 7,\n2008. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were admitted without\nobjection. The Government also offered HE II, comprising a request that I take\nadministrative notice of certain facts concerning the People\u2019s Republic of China and six\nGovernment documents supporting the veracity of those facts. Applicant had no\nobjection, and administrative notice was taken of these facts. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf, and submitted exhibits (AE) A through N, which were admitted without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 17, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations except\nthose contained in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e (in part), and 2.b. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including\nthose contained in his response to DOHA Interrogatories (GE 2), are incorporated in the\nfollowing findings.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old software engineer employed by a major defense\ncontractor. He has worked for his present employer and held a security clearance since\n1996. He has had no security violations or other incidents involving mishandling of\nsensitive information. Six senior supervisors and co-workers submitted sworn\ndeclarations attesting to his excellent work performance, character, judgment, and\nloyalty to the United States. He has received regular training in security matters and\nproper handling of sensitive information. (GE 1 at 6, 14; AE B - I; Tr. at 26-31.)\nApplicant was born in France. His father was a U.S. citizen working in Belgium,\nand his mother was a Belgian citizen. His birth was properly registered as a U.S. citizen\nborn overseas. At the time he was not recognized as a Belgian citizen because their law\nonly conferred citizenship along paternal lines. When he was five years old, the family\nmoved to the United States, where he has continued to reside ever since. He has four\nyounger brothers, two born in Belgium and two born in the U.S. In 1995, shortly after\nBelgian law changed to retroactively permit citizenship along maternal lines, Applicant\u2019s\nparents applied for, and obtained, Belgian citizenship for all their sons. All remain dual\ncitizens to date. Applicant\u2019s mother became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1998. (Tr. at\n33-39, 54-55.)\nApplicant was issued a one-year Belgian passport in 1995. In 1998, his employer\nneeded him to go to Europe to support a project on short notice. They knew he was a\ndual citizen, and it was much quicker for him to get a Belgian passport and work in\nEurope on that basis than to apply for a European work permit as a U.S. citizen.\nAccordingly, and with his employer\u2019s full knowledge and blessing, he obtained another\nBelgian passport in 1998. He only used it one time, in connection with entering Europe\nto work on that project. He has used his U.S. passport for all other foreign travel. He\n\n3\nrenewed his Belgian passport again in 2006, because his 1998 passport was expiring\nand he thought it could be useful if he needed to go work in Europe for his employer\nagain. He did not otherwise intend to seek work or move there. Upon becoming aware\nthat it created potential security concerns, Applicant surrendered his Belgian passport to\nhis employer, who had it destroyed on September 19, 2008. (GE 2 at 3-4; AE A; Tr. at\n53-58, 78-80.) \nIn July 2007, Applicant told a security investigator that he would not be willing to\nrenounce his foreign citizenship because he wanted to pass dual-citizenship on to his\nchildren to maximize their options, and in case he wished to travel or work in Europe in\nthe future. (GE 2 at 3.) During the hearing, he testified that he had no connections to\nBelgium that could cause or create potential for foreign influence, and has no intention\nto move there in the future. He said that he would be willing to renounce that citizenship\nif it was necessary to do so to maintain his security clearance. He explained that he was\nconfused at the time of his earlier statement, and was not really aware of what it all\nmeant. (Tr. at 70-72, 74.)\nApplicant voted in one Belgian election in 2007. He received a ballot in the mail,\ntogether with a letter explaining his legal obligation as a citizen to vote and that he could\nbe fined if he did not. He did not know the candidates, so asked his mother who\ncontacted her brother then recommended a candidate. He has no other connection to or\nparticipation in Belgian government. He testified that if he received another ballot in the\nfuture he would not vote, and would risk being fined if necessary. (GE 2 at 3; Tr. at 59-\n60, 74-75.)\nApplicant took a college course in the Mandarin Chinese language. He had\nalways been good at math and science, but found language more challenging to learn.\nHe applied for, and was granted a leave of absence from June though August 2000 to\nattend a Mandarin immersion study program at a university in Taiwan. He reads and\nwrites the language more proficiently than he understands and speaks the spoken\nversion. He no longer has any contact with anyone he knew in Taiwan. (Tr. at 51, 63-65,\n89-90.)  \nOne of Applicant\u2019s two younger brothers attended and graduated from an MBA\nprogram at a business school in China from August 2006 to August 2008. He has since\nreturned to the U.S., found work as a salesman, and intends to remain here. He chose\nto go to school overseas because he had not been accepted at various top U.S. schools\nand felt he could differentiate himself that way. His classes there were taught in English.\n(Tr. at 39-41.)\nApplicant met his wife by chance in a restaurant in 2001 and they married in\nAugust 2002. She was born and raised in China. She came to the U.S. in 1999, in order\nto gain work experience  and improve her English language skills. They now have two\nchildren, ages three and one. Applicant applied for, and obtained dual Belgian\ncitizenship for his children. They speak only English in their home, except during one\nrecent visit by her parents. His wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006, and\n\n4\nrenounced her Chinese citizenship in the process. She still works at a U.S. company. All\nof their financial assets, including a home in which they have substantial equity, are in\nthe U.S. (Tr. at 41-45, 65-69, 83, 90-91; AE J-N.)\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s sister in a Chinese citizen residing and also working in the U.S.\non an H1B work visa. She has been in the U.S. since entering on a student visa in\n2000, and has a pending application for a green card. Her work visa expires in a year,\nbut is renewable and she hopes to remain in the U.S. She is single, with no children.\n(Tr. at 52-53, 87-88.)\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are life-long citizens and residents of\nChina. He is a retired owner and chief executive of a private  company, and she worked\nfor that company as a secretary. Before that, she worked in an  assembly plant. Neither\nhas ever worked for the Chinese government or been members of the Communist\nParty. Applicant and his wife visited them and her grandmothers in China in 2003, after\ntheir marriage, and in 2006 after the birth of their elder daughter. During July to\nSeptember 2008, they came to visit the U.S. for two months using recently issued green\ncards awarding them permanent resident status for which Applicant and his wife had\nsponsored them. However, they did not establish actual residency here, and returned to\nChina in September to live in their home there and help their two elderly mothers\nthrough the winter months. Applicant testified that they intend to move to the U.S. next\nspring or summer, and will likely live with Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law, at least to begin. He\nhas some difficulty conversing with them because their Chinese is somewhat different\nthan he learned, and has minimal discussion with them. Almost all contact is through his\nwife, who has a close family relationship with them and her grandmothers. (Tr. at 47-52,\n75-77, 80-82.) \nI took administrative notice of the facts set forth in HE II concerning The People\u2019s\nRepublic of China. That country is large and economically powerful, with an\nauthoritarian government dominated by the Communist Party. They are a geo-political\nrival of the United States, and among the leading practitioners of espionage and\nindustrial theft activities against the United States. The U.S.-China Economic and\nSecurity Review Commission\u2019s 2007 Report to Congress, dated November 2007,\nconcluded, \u201cChinese espionage activities in the United States are so extensive that they\ncomprise the single greatest risk to the security of United States technologies.\u201d (AN III at\n106.) According to the State Department, China has a poor record of human rights, and\nits practices include arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture,\nmonitoring of electronic communications, and mistreatment of prisoners. The\nIntelligence Threat Handbook, issued by the Interagency OPSEC Support Staff, stated,\n\u201cThe United States is a primary intelligence target of China because of the U.S. role as\na global superpower; its substantial military, political, and economic presence in the\nPacific Rim and Asia; its role as a developer of advanced technology that China\nrequires for economic growth; and the large number of Americans of Chinese ancestry\nwho are considered prime intelligence targets by the PRC.\u201d (AN II at 17.) \n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 security concerns involving foreign preference arise because,\n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country\nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign\ncountry;\n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or\nother such benefits from a foreign country;\n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements;\n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial. or business\ninterests in another country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and,\n(7) voting in a foreign election;\n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen;\n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as\nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and,\n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than\nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United\nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship.\nApplicant\u2019s actions in obtaining and maintaining a Belgian passport since 1998\nraised security concerns under \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and 10(b) above. His single vote in a Belgian\n\n7\nelections raises potential concerns under AG \u00b6 10(a)(7) as well. He has not exercised\nany other rights, privileges or obligations of his Belgian citizenship, and does not intend\nto do so in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s earlier-stated refusal to renounce his Belgian citizenship, and\napplication for dual citizenship for his children, were based on his desire to retain future\noptions for himself and his children to travel, live, or work in Europe, and not on any\nsense of loyalty to Belgium or present intent to do any of those things. He is now willing\nto renounce his citizenship there, if necessary. Accordingly, I do not find that these\nactions establish any ongoing allegiance to Belgium, as contemplated under AG \u00b6\n10(d). \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate these security concerns:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the\nindividual was a minor;\n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security\nauthority.\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and,\n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States\nGovernment.\nApplicant\u2019s Belgian citizenship was based on his mother\u2019s, and his parents made initial\napplication for him together with his brothers. He expressed his present willingness to\nrenounce it, and withdrew his earlier reluctance to do so. His use of the Belgian\npassport to work in Europe was fully known to, and approved by, his supervisors at\nwork, and no security concerns were ever raised on that score. In fact, he did that only\nto more quickly meet the need for his services on a contract that benefitted U.S. security\ninterests. His passport has since been destroyed, and is no longer available to him for\nuse in foreign travel. And finally, his vote in the Belgian election was not encouraged by\nthe U.S. Government, but was legally required by Belgian law and seemed perfectly\nharmless to him at the time.  Appellant established substantial mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6\n11(a), (b), (d), (e), and (f).\n\n8\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel argued that the evidence in this case established\none of them: \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion.\u201d (Tr. at 95.) At my request, both counsel also addressed the\napplicability of  \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure or coercion.\u201d (Tr. at 116-120.) China is a country of significant\nconcern for information security and espionage against the U.S., so connections there\nare more likely to generate heightened risk of exploitation, etc. than most other\ncountries. Applicant\u2019s direct relationship with his mother-in-law and father-in-law, who\nremain in China caring for his wife\u2019s two elderly grandmothers, meets the Government\nburden of production raising both of these disqualifying conditions. His two visits to\nChina to visit these family members demonstrates the importance he and his wife place\non their family relationship. These contacts and relationships shift a heavy burden to\nApplicant to prove mitigation under applicable Appeal Board precedent. However, his\nbrother no longer lives in China and intends to remain in the U.S. Nor does Applicant\nhave any ongoing contacts or relationships from his three months spent studying\nMandarin Chinese in 2000. These former potential issues no longer raise security\nconcerns under this guideline.\nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Those with\npotential application in mitigating AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 (a) and (c) security concerns are:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.; and\n\n9\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s relationships with her family in China are close and important to\nher, and his relationship with her makes him susceptible to pressure and exploitation. It\nis not necessary that such pressure or exploitation be shown to have occurred to\nestablish these concerns. Their sponsorship of her parents for green cards, so they\nhave the ability to move permanently to the U.S., is a favorable factor that may, in time,\nalleviate concerns from his wife\u2019s family members remaining in China subject to that\ncountry\u2019s direct control. \nThe present potential is the problem, however. Although they have been granted\npermanent resident alien status to come to the U.S., Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law have not\nyet done so, and their mothers have no intention of doing so. Given the nature of the\nChinese government and Applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ongoing presence there, the heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion remains a\nconcern. Applicant failed to establish either of the mitigating conditions set forth in AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 8 (a) or (c) because his relationship with his wife and, through her, to her family is not\none that supports a conclusion that such risk of exploitation is unlikely. \nOther Guideline B mitigating conditions were established to some degree by\nApplicant, but are framed to provide mitigation for disqualifying conditions that were not\nasserted by the Government. These include: \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest (addressing AG \u00b6 7(b));\n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements\nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons,\ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country (addressing AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(f) or\n(g)); and\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property\ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not\nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual\n(addressing AG \u00b6 7(e)).\nThese mitigating conditions do not squarely address the \u00b6\u00b6 7 (a) or (c) security\nconcerns arising from heightened risk of foreign exploitation from the contacts and\nrelationships of concern. Accordingly, their mitigating effect is insufficient to overcome\nthose concerns raised by the undisputed facts in this case.\n\n10\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern does not involve any personal misconduct, dishonesty or disloyal activity. While\nother factors including his excellent work record, character and loyalty have been duly\nconsidered, the primary whole-person conduct that is of concern under these\ncircumstances is his marriage to a former Chinese citizen with Chinese citizen/resident\nparents and grandmothers. This raises, \u201c(8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress;\u201d and \u201c(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nApplicant has not sufficiently met his burden to mitigate the resultant security\nconcerns. His close family ties, through his wife, to people who currently reside in and\nare citizens of the People\u2019s Republic of China create an ongoing potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation or duress, and the likelihood of continuation in the medium-term\nfuture is established by the evidence of record. While his wife\u2019s family still lives there, he\nmay well visit there again and be personally subject to the actions of the Chinese\ngovernment as well. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He mitigated foreign preference\nsecurity concerns, but has not met his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising\nfrom foreign influence considerations.\n\n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn August 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nApril 20, 2010\n\nISCR Case No. 01-17051 (December 6, 2002).\n1\nISCR Case No. 03-07826 (App. Bd. June 17, 2005 at 3).\n2\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on September 14, 2009, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on November 9, 2009. On December 7, 2009, a notice of\nhearing was issued scheduling the case for January 6, 2010. That day, Applicant\nasserted she did not receive the government\u2019s proposed exhibits before the hearing,\nand moved for a continuance. Department Counsel did not object, and I granted the\nmotion, rescheduling the case for January 21, 2010. The case was held as rescheduled.\nAt the hearing, I received eight government exhibits, fourteen Applicant exhibits, and the\ntestimony of Applicant. Also, at Department Counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative\nnotice of the decision and the SOR in Applicant\u2019s previous ISCR case (Hearing Exhibits\n(HE) I and II).  The transcript was received on January 28, 2010.\n1\nProcedural Ruling\nSOR subparagraph 1.v alleges that Applicant is \u201cindebted to a Medical account\nthat has been placed for collection in the approximate amount of $2,737.\u201d Applicant\ndenied it. This allegation is overbroad because it does not identify a specific creditor.\nAlthough an SOR does not have to satisfy the strict requirements of a criminal\nindictment, it must still place an applicant on adequate notice of the allegations so that\nshe may have a reasonable opportunity to respond and prepare a defense.2\nSubparagraph 1.v does not meet this minimum threshold, therefore, I conclude that it is\nnot justiciable, and resolve it in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 39-year-old widow with three children, ages 22, 19, and 11 (Tr. 23).\nShe has a high school diploma and has earned approximately two and a half years of\ncollege credits (Tr. 24). She works for a defense contractor in the information\ntechnology field (Tr. 28). She has worked for the same employer for five years (Tr. 26).\nApplicant first experienced financial difficulties after her husband\u2019s death in 1997.\nBy 2002, she had accrued approximately $11,000 of delinquent debt, prompting DOHA\nto issue an SOR later that year (HE II). Based in part on her promises to satisfy all of\nher debts by the end of 2003, the administrative judge granted her a clearance (HE 1 at\n2 \u00b6 2).\nIn April 2004, Applicant lost her job and was unemployed for the next seven\nmonths (GE 1 at 19). Her bills again became delinquent. In September 2004, Applicant\nfiled for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection (Answer). The petition listed approximately\n$57,900 of debt, including two debts Applicant had promised to pay by the end of 2003,\nduring the earlier security clearance investigation, (HE 1 at 2).\n\n3\nApplicant did not consistently make the monthly payments to the bankruptcy\ntrustee (Tr. 29). Consequently, the court dismissed the bankruptcy approximately two\nmonths later (Answer at 1). \nBy March 2009, Applicant had accrued approximately $130,000 of delinquent\ndebt. SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.e are utility bills totalling $730. Applicant satisfied\nthem (GE D and F, respectively). SOR subparagraph 1.r is a credit card with a $317\nbalance. Applicant satisfied this debt, also (GE J). \nThe creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.s is a credit union loan for an\nautomobile purchase in 1999 (GE 7 at 28). In 2006, the car was stolen, and a $6,900\nbalance was owed (Tr. 37; GE K at 2). It is unclear from the record why Applicant still\nowed a balance after seven years. Nevertheless, her insurance company paid the\ncreditor the remaining balance in March 2007 (AE K at 2).\nApplicant did not recognize the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.w. She\ncontacted the creditor and successfully disputed it (Tr. 40). Consequently, the credit\nreporting agencies removed it from her credit reports.\nThe remainder of the SOR debts, totalling approximately $111,000, are student\nloans. The debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d, totalling approximately\n$21,000, are owed to the same creditor. Applicant consolidated them and arranged a\npayment plan (Answer at 7). She contends she has been paying $95 monthly under the\nplan, but only provided evidence supporting one payment in June 2009 and another in\nDecember 2009 (GE E, Answer at 7).\nApplicant consolidated the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.f through 1.n.\nThe total amount due currently is approximately $43,000 (Tr. 34; GE G). Applicant\ncontends she arranged a payment plan under which she has been paying $50 monthly\nsince March 2009 (Tr. 34). Applicant only provided a one receipt, dated December 2,\n2009, that demonstrates she has been making any payments (GE G).\nSOR subparagraph 1.o totals approximately $4,900. Applicant settled this\naccount in February 2009 (AE H at 2).\nSOR subparagraphs 1.p, 1.q, and 1.x total approximately $10,500. Applicant\ninitiated a payment plan in June 2009 with a $245 payment (GE I). Under the plan, she\nis to pay $70 each month (Tr. 35). She made a payment in December 2009 (GE I at 2).\nThe evidence does not establish whether she made any payments between the June\n2009 and December 2009.\nThe debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.t is approximately $9,258. On January\n13, 2010, Applicant filed a \u201cRequest for Forbearance\u201d with the creditor (AE L at 4). Her\nrequest is pending (AE A). Applicant\u2019s monthly payments in the amount of $69 were\nscheduled to begin in February 2010 (Id. at 1).\n\n4\nSOR subparagraph 1.u is a student loan from a university Applicant attended in\n2004 (Tr. 39, 82). The balance is approximately $1,350. Applicant wrote the creditor on\nJanuary 6, 2010 proposing to pay $25 monthly through a payment plan (AE M).\nSOR subparagraphs 1.y through 1.gg, totalling approximately $39,000, are owed\nto the same creditor. Although the creditor\u2019s account information indicates the debt is\nsatisfied, Applicant never made payments, and does not \u201cknow if [these debts were]\nbought by one of the other companies or if [they were] paid through some of the grants\u201d\nshe had applied for over the years (Tr. 91). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied together with the factors\nlisted in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\n\n5\nApplicant successfully disputed the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.w.\nConsequently, I resolve it in her favor.\nApplicant\u2019s first episode of financial difficulties occurred after her husband\u2019s\ndeath in the late 1990s, and her second episode occurred after a lengthy period of\nunemployment in 2004. Since then, Applicant has contacted creditors, arranged\npayment plans, successfully disputed one account, as referenced above, and satisfied\nseveral others. Consequently, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply. \nApplicant deserves credit for either satisfying or successfully removing\napproximately $50,000 of debt from the SOR. However, she has yet to begin resolving\naccounts totalling approximately $10,500, and provided insufficient evidence that she\nhas been making consistent, monthly payments toward the satisfaction of the\nconsolidated student loan accounts totalling approximately $74,500. Under these\ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol,\u201d is inapplicable.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant has made significant progress towards resolving her delinquent debts.\nHowever, approximately $86,000 of delinquent debt remains outstanding. She has yet\nto begin making payments on two of these accounts totalling $10,500, and she failed to\nestablish that she has been making consistent payments toward the satisfaction of the\nremainder. Moreover, although Applicant\u2019s delinquencies accrued largely because of a\nlengthy unemployment beginning in 2004, two of them preceded the unemployment and\nwere at issue during an earlier ISCR case. Applicant failed to fulfill a promise, made at\nthat time, to pay those two delinquencies by the end of 2003. Under these\ncircumstances, I am not persuaded Applicant will be able to adhere to the payment\nplans she has recently organized.\n\n6\nApplicant deserves credit for trying to earn a college degree while working and\nraising children. However, she has too much outstanding debt and offered too little proof\nthat she is satisfying it for me to conclude it no longer constitutes a security concern,\ngiven the amount that remains outstanding. Upon considering Applicant\u2019s case in the\ncontext of the whole-person concept, I conclude that her application for a security\nclearance must be denied.\nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot\nor will not attain the state of financial rehabilitation necessary to mitigate the financial\nconsideration security concern. Should Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply\nfor a security clearance in the future, she may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of\nsecurity worthiness.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c - 1d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.f - 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.r - 1.s:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.t - 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.v - 1.w:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.y - 1.gg:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns \nunder financial considerations. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on November 19, 2008, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nMay 20, 2009\n\n \n \n \n2\n  \n \nOn December 5, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. \nOn February 12, 2009, I was assigned the case. On February 19, 2009, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling the hearing which was held on March 18, 2009.  \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through F, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. The record was held open to allow additional \ninformation from Applicant. On March 25, 2009, additional material was submitted. \nDepartment Counsel had no objection to the material, which was admitted into the \nrecord as Ex. G. On March 31, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 \n1.d, 1.f, 1.g. and 1.l. He admitted the remaining factual allegations. He provided an \nadditional document to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old senior price analyst who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since October 2006, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s co-workers, colleagues, supervisors, acquaintances, and friends state: \nApplicant is a man of genuine character and integrity, trustworthy, honest, talented, \nenergetic, hardworking, enthusiastic, dedicated, a determined and courteous \nprofessional, with a strong moral character and strong work ethic. (Ex. A)  \n \nApplicant asserts he had no financial problems until January 2000 when he \nmoved from California to a new state. He had been given the option by his employer of \nbeing laid off or moving to a company location in the new state. When he moved, he \nintended the move would be temporary until he could find another job and relocate back \nto California. His alternate plan was to have his family relocate to his new location. \nApplicant\u2019s daughter had a congenital heart condition. (Tr. 30) The first day at his new \nlocation his daughter was hospitalized and he had to rush back to California. Applicant \nwas unable to find a job in California and his wife refused to relocate to his new location.  \n \nApplicant exhausted his 401(k) retirement plan funds attempting to maintain \nhomes in both locations. (Ex. 3) Use of his retirement funds resulted in tax liability. \nAdditionally, the relocation money received from his company for his move was also \ntaxable. (Tr. 31) A tax liability for tax years 2000 and 2001 was incurred. (Tr. 31) A tax \nlien was placed on his property. Starting in 2003, Applicant made offers in compromise \nto the IRS. (Ex. 3) Applicant was unsuccessful in his attempt to negotiate a settlement \nwith the IRS. The IRS demanded $5,000 and $500 per month, which Applicant was \nunable to pay.  \n \nIn June 2008, the IRS intercepted Applicant\u2019s $900 tax refund and applied it to \nhis tax debt leaving a balance of $29,891 in past due taxes for tax year 2001. (Answer \nto SOR, Ex. 3) Applicant is not currently making payment to the IRS. (Tr. 44) The SOR \nalleges three tax liens which total $61,580. In March 2009, Applicant submitted an IRS \n\n \n \n \n3\nForm 911, Request for Taxpayer Advocate Service Assistance. No settlement has been \nreached with the IRS. \n \nIn November 2002, Applicant\u2019s separation from his family ended in a divorce. \n(Ex. 3) He was required to pay $1,408 monthly child support for his three children. (Ex. \nC) Applicant got behind on his child support obligation (SOR \u00b6 1.e, $11,770). In \nDecember 2008, Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report (CBR) indicates Applicant was 60 \ndays delinquent. (Ex. B) At that time, Applicant child/family support obligation was \n$12,004. Applicant\u2019s February 12, 2009 pay statement indicated Applicant was paying \nmonthly child support of $1,385 with an additional $250 monthly for the child support \narrearage. (Ex. D, Tr. 40) \n \nIn December 2001, Applicant opened a credit account (SOR \u00b6 1.i, $1,167). The \ndebt remained unpaid. In 2002, Applicant remarried. From April 2006 to October 2006, \nApplicant was laid off from work. In October 2006, he obtained his current job.  \n \nFollowing the hearing, Applicant paid the $156 medical debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n(Ex. G, a) He made a $100 payment on the $250 medical debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Ex. \nG, b) He paid the cable bill listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Ex. G, c) \n \nApplicant had a credit card account with a credit union. He made payments on \nthe account until 2000, when he stopped making payments. (Ex. 3) As of December \n2003, Applicant owed $3,589 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). (Ex. G, f-2) By December 2007, the debt had \nincreased to $4,965. (Ex. G, f-3) The credit union debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.f and SOR \u00b6 \n1.g are the same debt, which remains unpaid. The one account was closed out and the \nsecond opened. (Tr. 41)  \n \nIn April 2003, a $2,866 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h) was sold or transferred. In April 2006, \nan account with a collection agency was opened with a $2,886 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) balance. \n(Ex. 5) Applicant\u2019s CBR states, \u201cConsumer disputes this account information.\u201d (Answer \nto SOR, Ex. 4, Ex. D) \n  \nIn June 2007, Applicant provided a comprehensive analysis of his current \nfinancial situation. (Ex. 3) His monthly gross salary was $7,485 and his monthly \ndisposable income was $1,855. Applicant is receiving counseling to develop a financial \nplan to address his debts. (Ex. G) In 2008, Applicant purchased a 1995 vehicle for \n$1,000. (Tr. 34, Ex. F) He makes $277 monthly payments on a 2001 vehicle. (Tr. 53)  \n \nA summary of the 12 SOR debts follows: \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount \nCurrent Status \na \nMedical account. \n$156 \nPaid. (Ex.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n \n \n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n\n \n \n \n6\n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his \ninterview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, his SOR \nresponse, and his testimony. Applicant owed more than $58,000 on past due \nobligations. He has provided insufficient documentation to show significant progress \nresolving his debts. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nThe SOR alleges 11 past due obligations totaling in excess of $89,000. Applicant \nhas paid two debts (SOR \u00b6 1.a, $156 and SOR \u00b6 1.c, $201) totaling less than $400. He \nis making payment on two additional debts. He made a $100 payment and has yet to \nmake two additional payments totaling $150 on one debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b, $250). Applicant\u2019s \n$12,000 child support arrearage (SOR \u00b6 1.e) is being repaid at a rate of $250 monthly. \nTwo debts listed in the SOR are duplicates. The $3,401 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) is the same as the \n\n \n \n \n7\n$5,131 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) debt. The $2,886 debt (SOR \u00b6 1. d), a debt Applicant disputes, is \nthe same debt as the $2,866 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h). The $5,131 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and the \n$1,167 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) remain unpaid. \n \nApplicant owes approximately $30,000 in past due taxes, which represent three \nof the SOR debts (SOR \u00b6 1.j, $6,864; SOR \u00b6 1.k, $22,487; SOR \u00b6 1.l, $32,229). \nApplicant\u2019s past due taxes remains unpaid.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s financial problems were contributed to when he \nhad to change work locations. He attempted to maintain two households. In 2002, \nApplicant divorced and remarried. His use of his retirement funds and relocation pay \nresulted in a tax lien of approximately $30,000. Applicant has unsuccessfully attempted \nto reach a settlement with the IRS. The behavior did not happen long ago, but his \nrelocation is an event unlikely to recur. However, his taxes remain unpaid thereby \ncasting doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \nhas limited applicability.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant experienced both separation and divorce along with \nthe financial burden associated with each. From April 2006 to October 2006, Applicant \nwas laid off from work. AG & 20(b) has limited applicability because he has no plan to \npay the tax liability. \n \nUnder AG & 20(d), Applicant has paid two of the debts and is making payment \non two other debts. Applicant has made a good-faith effort to repay his overdue \nobligations as to these four obligations. Under AG & 20(c), he has received financial \ncounseling; however three debts totaling approximately $36,000 remain unpaid. There \nis no repayment plan for those debts. AG & 20(c) does not apply. These three unpaid \ndebts raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n\n \n \n \n8\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Applicant indicated his \nmove from one state to another dictated by his work resulted in a divorce and large tax \ndebt. In July 2007, Applicant became aware of the government concern about his \nfinances and he answered interrogatories in July 2008. (Ex. 2, 3, 4) He has done little to \nresolve or manage his delinquent debts since learning of the government\u2019s concern. He \nhas paid approximately $500 of the debt and is repaying his child support arrearage at a \nrate of $250 monthly.  \n \n \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s 2007 budget, he had money, approximately $1,800 \ndiscretionary income each month, which he could have used to resolve old debts. More \nthan $36,000 of debt remains unresolved.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant misused a government computer in 1998 to view pornography while on\nactive duty. He was fired while a probationary government employee in 2006 for alleged\ncomputer misuse that was neither serious nor the actual reason. He fully mitigated\npotential security concerns arising from his conduct. Based upon a thorough review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF-86), on August\n27, 2007, and resubmitted a signed copy of this Electronic Questionnaires for\nInvestigative Processing (e-QIP) retained copy on June 10, 2008, when the original was\ntemporarily lost. On September 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns\nunder Guidelines E, M, and D. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nApril 14, 2009\n\n2\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 1, 2008. DOHA received\nhis undated written answer to the SOR on October 20, 2008. In this answer, Applicant\nrequested that a determination be made without a hearing. On November 17, 2008,\nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing before an administrative judge, pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.7. DOHA assigned the case to me on November 21, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 2, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on January 8, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until January 22,\n2009, to permit Applicant to obtain and submit some documents that he did not bring to\nthe hearing. This evidence was submitted on January 15, 2009, and admitted as AE A\nwithout objection by Department Counsel. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on January 26, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked\nfor two years as an information technology customer service representative. He is\nmarried, and has two children, ages 20 and 16. In his response to the SOR, he admitted\nthe truth of all the allegations except for the year he sought counseling in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d\nand 3.b. During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to correct\nthe year alleged in these two paragraphs from \u201c2000\" to \u201c1998.\u201d Applicant had no\nobjection to this amendment, and the motion was granted. Applicant\u2019s admissions are\nincorporated into the following findings of fact.\nApplicant enlisted in the Air Force in 1983, at age 18, and retired just over 20\nyears later as a master sergeant (E-7). He acquired a Secret clearance after his first\nyear of service, and a Top Secret clearance about two years after that. He worked in\nreconnaissance imagery processing and visual information management, and\nmaintained this clearance successfully working with classified information throughout his\ntime in the service. He received Good Conduct Medals covering his entire period of\nservice, as well as numerous personal and service awards to include two Meritorious\nService Medals in 2001 and 2003. (GE 4; AE A at 1; Tr. at 34-38.)\nDuring 1998, an officer detected Applicant viewing adult pornography on his\nGovernment computer. He had done this three of four times previously, and realized\nthat he should not have done so. He was awarded a non-punitive letter of reprimand for\nmisusing the computer, and his performance report for that year was adversely\nimpacted. That report, however, noted that the administrative actions taken against him\nhad proven effective in changing his behavior. (AE A at 8-9.) His unit commander\nnominated him for award of the Base NCO of the Quarter for his outstanding\n\n3\nperformance and contributions the quarter following that performance report. (AE A at\n10.) His performance report for the next year contained the highest possible marks in\neach category, and recommended him for immediate promotion. He was then promoted\nto Master Sergeant effective January 1, 2001. (AE A at 11-12; GE 4; Tr. at 40-48.)\nApplicant voluntarily sought counseling at the Air Force clinic because he was\nconcerned that he might have some compulsion or addiction that caused him to violate\ncomputer-use rules by viewing pornography. After attending six or seven sessions,\nApplicant and his counselor agreed that he was not addicted to pornography, but simply\nneeded to make better choices and resist temptation. He has since occasionally viewed\npornography, but never on a work computer or in any illegal manner. (Answer at 4; Tr.\nat 41-42, 59.) \nAbout two years after his retirement from the Air Force, Applicant was hired to fill\na civil service position providing information technology and executive support on an Air\nForce headquarters staff. Three months into that job, the commanding general issued\nhim a letter of appreciation for quickly returning their computer fleet to fully mission\ncapable status after more than a third of them crashed due to corrupted software. The\ngeneral selected him as Civilian Employee of the Quarter for the last quarter of 2005,\nhis fifth through seventh months on the job, for which he also received a $250 cash\naward. He also received a 24-hour time-off award on May 25, 2006. (AE A at 3-7.) \nIn March 2006, Applicant was in the back area of the command conference room\nupdating a security patch on the secure computer there. While waiting for that computer\nto process the changes, he was looking at the MSN homepage on the unclassified\ncomputer system. Under the \u201cmost frequent searches\u201d heading, he saw a woman\u2019s\nname he did not recognize, so he opened the link. The web site that appeared showed\nthe woman, an actress, dressed in very scanty attire. Unbeknown to Applicant, the\nunclassified computer was projecting onto the large-screen display in the conference\nroom, and a female co-worker who had come in saw the image of the actress. She told\nApplicant about the improper projected image and that he shouldn\u2019t do that. She also\napparently reported this to his active duty E-8 supervisor, with whom Applicant had a\npersonality conflict. This conflict arose because Applicant did not like or agree with his\nsupervisor\u2019s leadership qualities, and did not conceal his opinions in that regard. (GE 3\nat 3; Tr. at 31-33, 49-51.)\nThe supervisor seized Applicant\u2019s government computer and had it searched. In\nJune 2006, two days before completing his one-year probationary period, the supervisor\nterminated Applicant\u2019s employment citing improper computer usage while employed to\nact as the command computer security manager. Applicant admits that he had played\nthe pre-installed card game on the computer, had used it to check weather and surf\nreports, and had used it to update his official Air Force personnel system resume - all\nwith either express or tacit permission from his supervisors. The weight of evidence\nindicates that this termination was due to the fact that his supervisor disliked and\nresented Applicant and could fire him without recourse as a probationary employee, and\nnot because Applicant violated standard computer-use policies or practices. Applicant\n\n4\nfurther proved that his termination was not based on poor performance, since his\nevaluations and awards reflect that he did an excellent job. He has maintained his\nsecurity clearance without incident throughout the past 25 years, and fully intends to\nremain well within proper computer use policies in the future. (AE A; Tr. at 29-31, 51-53,\n60-64.) Applicant was forthright and credible throughout his testimony.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \n\n5\nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or\ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to\nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview,\ncompleting security forms or releases, and cooperation with\nmedical or psychological evaluation; and,\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful\nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official\nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or\ntrustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DCs). The Government\u2019s allegations raise potential concerns under two of\nthese provisions:\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\n\n6\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized\nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected\ninformation:\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and,\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer's time or resources.\nApplicant admitted improperly viewing pornography on a government computer\nseveral times in 1998. After he was caught and administratively reprimanded for doing\nso, he never repeated this conduct. He sought counseling to determine whether he\nneeded help to deal with some type of addiction, and ultimately determined that he had\nno addiction and did not need further help. In June 2006, he was fired from his civilian\nposition with the Air Force for the stated reason that he misused his government\ncomputer for non-governmental purposes. The Government established sufficient\nevidence, in the form of Applicant\u2019s own statements and admissions, to raise potential\nsecurity concerns under these two whole-person related disqualifying conditions. The\nseriousness of those concerns, and the degree to which Applicant has mitigated them,\nwill be further analyzed under the whole-person analysis at the conclusion of this\ndecision.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MCs).\nApplicant provided evidence that supports mitigation under the following three\nprovisions:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n\n7\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct which was clearly wrong occurred more than ten years ago,\nand had no effect on continuation of his Top Secret clearance or work with highly\nclassified information. His counseling was voluntarily undertaken and successful, and he\nnever again accessed pornography on a government or work computer. He was\nsubsequently promoted, awarded two Meritorious Service Medals, and honorably\ndischarged upon retirement from the Air Force. \nThe only subsequent incident of accessing inappropriate content on a\ngovernment computer was entirely accidental, in that he did not realize the image would\nbe either provocative or projected where it could be seen by others. His other arguably\nnon-official uses of his government computer while an Air Force civilian employee were\nknown to and approved by his supervisors. These incidents did not exceed typically\nacceptable practices, or adversely affect his excellent work performance. The evidence\nfully supports Applicant\u2019s contention that he was fired at the end of his probationary\nperiod due to a personality conflict with a supervisor whom he openly considered to be\na poor leader, and who used computer-use issues as a pretext for this action. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems\nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information\ntechnology systems:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The only DC supported by evidence in this case is, \u201c(e) unauthorized use\nof a government or other information technology system.\u201d Applicant\u2019s viewing of\npornography in 1998 was unauthorized, and he knew it. Viewing the web site showing a\nscantily clad actress in 2006 was also unauthorized, but was a one-time and accidental\nevent. The evidence shows that the other alleged misuse of his government computer\ndid not constitute unauthorized use, was either expressly or tacitly approved by his\nsupervisors at the time it occurred, and was merely a pretext for terminating his\nemployment during probationary status due to a personality conflict. \n\n8\nAG \u00b6 41 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational\nefficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one's\npassword or computer when no other timely alternative was readily\navailable; and,\n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a\nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of\nsupervisor.\nApplicant\u2019s 1998 viewing of pornography is mitigated under AG \u00b6 41(a) since it\nwas more than ten years ago, has not recurred, and no longer casts any doubt on his\nreliability or judgment. The conference room incident is mitigated under AG \u00b6 41(c),\nsince it was isolated and inadvertent, promptly corrected and addressed with his\nsupervisor. The other alleged instances of unauthorized non-official use are mitigated\nunder AG \u00b6 41(b) since they fall within typically authorized unofficial use, and were\nknown to and approved of by supervisory personnel when taking place. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The DC raised by the evidence in this case is, \u201c(d) sexual behavior of a\npublic nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s use of his\ngovernment computer to view pornography during 1998 reflected a lack of discretion\nand judgment. His subsequent counseling, however, revealed that he did not suffer from\nany addiction to pornography or other personality or emotional disorder. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. As discussed\nabove under other guidelines dealing with analogous concerns, Applicant proved\nmitigation of security concerns stemming from that conduct under AG \u00b6 14(b), \u201cthe\n\n9\nsexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual\ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involved his brief misuse of a government computer in 1998 for viewing\npornography, seeking counseling for potential addiction thereto, and alleged subsequent\nmisuse of government computers in 2006. The 1998 misuse was wrongful, but brief and\nceased once he was caught and reprimanded for it. He sought counseling to help\nensure such conduct would not recur, and was determined to have no addiction or other\nproblem requiring ongoing assistance. He continued with highly classified work, and\nwas promoted and highly decorated during the remainder of his active duty career. His\n2006 computer-related conduct was not shown to be knowingly wrongful or sufficiently\nimproper to reflect poor judgment or untrustworthiness. \nApplicant is fully mature, educated, and accountable for his conduct. His\nperformance appraisals and recognition awards reflect consistent outstanding\nperformance in areas requiring protection of classified and other sensitive information.\nHis entire adult life has been spent supporting and defending the interests of national\nsecurity, and he demonstrated credibility and integrity during his hearing. The evidence\ndemonstrated no vulnerability to pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress. He was fired\nduring his probationary Government employment due to a personality conflict with his\nimmediate supervisor, and not due to any legitimately actionable computer misuse or\npoor work performance. \n\n10\nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to meet his burden of\npersuasion to mitigate reliability and trustworthiness concerns arising from the\nundisputed conduct that was alleged in the SOR and supported by his statements.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline M:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline D:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.       \n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 17, 2008.

She believed this creditor was the same as another creditor\n4\nfor a vehicle loan she had prior to buying this car. After discussion of the two creditors at the hearing, she\nrealized the creditor in SOR allegation 1.h is not the same as the other automobile creditor. She acknowledged\nowing this debt. Tr. 38-40, 56-65. \n2\njudge. DOHA received the request shortly thereafter. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on August 28, 2008, and I received the case assignment on\nSeptember 3, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 12, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on September 29, 2008. The government offered\nfive exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She submitted ten exhibits (AE) A\nthrough E, and G through J, which were received. Nine were admitted into evidence\nwithout objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 3,\n1\n2008. I held the record open until October 20, 2008, for Applicant to submit additional\ndocuments. On October 20, 2008, she submitted 10 exhibits, AE K through AE T, which\nwere marked and admitted into evidence, without objection. The record closed on\nOctober 20, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated August 11, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.g of the SOR. She denied the remaining factual\nallegations in the SOR. She also provided additional information to support her request\nfor eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 34 years old, works as an administrative assistant for a\ncontractor to the Department of State. She has held this job since March 2006. She is\nengaged and a single mother, with two daughters, ages 16 and 13, and a\ngranddaughter. She supports all three children.2\nIn 2002, Applicant lost her job. She did not work full-time for three or four months.\nDuring this time she received unemployment benefits and worked part-time, no more\nthan 20 hours a week, as a stock clerk. She has worked steadily since this time.3\nAbout the time she lost her job, her car was stolen. The police recovered it. She\nvoluntarily returned her car to the creditor after the car was recovered because she\ncould not afford the car payment. She believed she owed about $5,000 on her loan after\nthe car was sold. She has no information which verifies her belief.

She also wrote a letter\nto a creditor she believed held the debt listed in SOR allegation 1.h. After some\ndiscussion at the hearing, she realized that the creditor in 1.h was not the same creditor.\nThe letter sent by Applicant to each creditor requested the creditor to provide\ninformation under the Federal Debt Collection Act regarding her debt. She also\nchallenged seven SOR debts with one of the credit reporting companies. Following the\nhearing, Applicant wrote to the creditors listed in SOR allegations 1.c, 1.d, and 1.h.5\nApplicant earns approximately $38,000 a year. Her net monthly income is $2,900\nplus children support of approximately $600 a month. Her monthly expenses total\napproximately $2,500, leaving approximately $1,000 a month to pay debts.6\nA review of Appellant\u2019s credit reports dated December 26, 2006, March 28, 2008,\nJune 19, 2008, September 19, 2008, and the SOR shows the following debts and their\ncurrent status:7\nSOR \u00b6\nTYPE OF DEBT\nAMOUNT\nSTATUS, EVIDENCE\n1.a\nCell phone bill\n$     225.00\nChallenged, verified, filed fraud\nclaim (Response to SOR; GE\n2-5; AE A, C and S)\n1.b\nCell phone bill\n$     612.00\nChallenged, verified, filed fraud\nclaim (Response to SOR; GE\n2-5; AE A, C and R)\n1.c\nCheck nonpayment\n$       35.00\nVerified; Paid (GE 3, 4; AE L)\n1.d\nCheck nonpayment\n$       25.00\nVerified; Paid (GE 3, 4; AE K)\n1.e\nBank account fees\n$     175.00\nUnpaid\n1.f\nRent \n$  2,646.00\nChallenged, verified; AE C\nResponse to SOR; unpaid\n1.g\nCheck nonpayment\n$       27.00\nChallenged, verified, paid;\nGE 2-5; AE N\n\nAccordingly, I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.l to eliminate the duplication.\n8\nAccordingly, I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.o to eliminate the duplication.\n9\nAE J (Application for loan); AE T (Loan denial); Tr. 34-35, 67, 84.\n10\n4\n1.h\nCar repossession\n$10,191.00\nDisputes balance; proposed\npayment plan - $75 biweekly;\npaid $75 on 10/17/08 (GE 3-5;\nAE P)  \n1.i\nUtility bill\n$     469.00\n(actual amount\nowed $174.20)\nPayment plan; paid first of\nthree installments (AE O)\n1.j\nRent\n$  1,892.00\nUnpaid\n1.k\nCollection creditor\n(original creditor\nunknown)\n$     832.00\nDebt challenged, deleted on\ncredit report (Response to\nSOR)\n1.l\nUtility bill\n$     469.00\nSame as 1.i; deleted from\ncredit report after challenge8\n1.m\nLoan\n$     220.00\nChallenged, deleted\n(Response to SOR)\n1.n\nClothing store bill\n$     214.00\nDisputes (GE 5), unpaid\n1.o\nCell phone bill\n$  1,023.00\nSame as 1.r; account closed\n(GE 2, 5)\n9\n1.p\nInsurance bill\n$     116.00\n(actual amount\nowed $193.00)\nPayment plan (AE M); paid first\nof three payments\n1.q\nCollection account\n(original creditor\nunknown)\n$       96.00\nUnpaid\n1.r\nCell phone bill\n$     906.00\nProposed payment plan of\n$75.00 a month; Paid $75 on\n10/17/08 (AE Q)\nTwice, Applicant co-signed a rental agreement with another person, who\ndefaulted on the rent payments.

She sought a loan to pay the\n$2,646 debt, but her loan application was denied.  \n10\n\nId. at 54-55.\n11\n5\nApplicant acknowledges that many of the debts in the SOR are her fault. She has\nlearned the value of good credit. She misused credit in the past and is now paying for\nher behavior. She is working to clean up her credit.11\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n6\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt over a period of time. She\nhas lacked the ability to pay her debts and until recently, has been unwilling to resolve\nthem. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial problems have been ongoing for awhile. Her debt did not occur under any\nunusual circumstances. This potentially mitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant lost her job in\n2002, and as a result, she could not afford to make her car payment. She voluntarily\nreturned her car, a reasonable action at the time.  Her other debts are not the result of\ncircumstances beyond her control. This mitigating condition partially applies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Although she did not receive debt counseling,\nupon learning that her past debts could negatively impact her ability, Applicant initiated\n\n7\ncontact with her creditor to obtain information on the status of her debts. Her efforts led\nto the removal of a few debts from her credit report, the payment of three small debts\nand an offer to pay several larger debts. Because she is making an effort to resolve her\ndebts, this mitigating condition is partially applicable. \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing efforts to pay her debts and develop payment plans for her larger debts is not\nsufficient at this time to demonstrate that she has made a good faith effort to resolve her\nold debts because she has not shown a track record for paying these debts. This\nmitigating condition does not apply.\nFinally, under AG \u00b6 20(e), Applicant could mitigate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns by showing she had \u201ca reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue.\u201d Applicant acted reasonably when she challenged the validity of seven debts\n(allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.k, 1.l, 1.h, 1.p, and1.q,) because she did not believe that these\ndebts were hers. Likewise, her decision to challenge the validity of two other debts\n(allegation 1.g and a debt not on the SOR) on the grounds she had paid the debts was\nrational. Her challenges resulted in the deletion of four debts from her credit report. She\npaid one and learned she still owed money to another creditor and is paying this debt\nunder a payment plan. Because the credit reporting agencies verified the debts listed in\nSOR allegations 1.a and 1.b and she denies these debts are hers, Applicant filed a\nfraud complaint with the credit reporting agency. The December 26, 2006, credit report\nreflects that she disputed the debt listed in SOR allegation 1.n, as she paid the bill. This\nmitigation condition applies only to the mitigation of SOR allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.k, 1.m,\nand 1.n.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n8\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nIn reaching a conclusion under the whole person concept, I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began as a young\nwoman, trying to raise two daughters on her own with limited funds. (See AG & 2(a)(4).)\nHer accumulated debt from the car repossession occurred because she lost her job and\ncould no longer pay the monthly car payment. In recent years, she has accumulated\nadditional debts, most of which have not been paid. Six months ago, she realized her\npast debts would prevent her from obtaining a security clearance. She is to be\ncommended for the effort she has taken since then to locate and resolve her debt\nproblems. Now that she knows what debts are valid, she has started to resolve her debt\nissues. She paid her three smallest debts two weeks ago. She has offered to repay\nseveral more debts through payment plans. Two debts will be paid shortly, and the\nremaining debts will take some time. Given her past record for not paying her debts, her\npresent efforts are not sufficient to establish a track record for good financial\nmanagement. Applicant needs to demonstrate that she can manage her finances and\npay her bills for a period of time. She has not mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns regarding her finances.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $23,483 for seven delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.g). Applicant admitted with explanation the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. He denied with explanation the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. In addition to the facts entered through Applicant\u2019s admissions, I have made the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 30 years old and has held his current defense contractor job since August 2005. He was also employed by a defense contractor from October 2003 until being laid off after his company lost its contract in June 2005. Applicant served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1997 until October 2001. Since then, he has served part-time in the Navy Reserve, and he was recalled to active duty in 2006 for an overseas deployment. He has held a security clearance since 1998. (Gx. 1) Applicant and his wife have been married since March 1998. They have two children, ages 9 and 4. His wife has worked as a benefits eligibility specialist for a state agency since about 2004. She had worked for another state agency but was laid off due to budget cuts in 2003. Thereafter, she was unemployed for about six to nine months. Applicant\u2019s wife also lost income because she was on extended bed rest during her two pregnancies in late 1998 / early 1999 and in the summer of 2004.

Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s\n2\naccess to classified information. On July 14, 2008, DOHA sent Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n3\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on September 24, 2008, and I convened the hearing on October 23,\n2008. The government presented three exhibits (Gx. 1 - 3). Applicant and his wife\ntestified, and he submitted three exhibits (Ax. A - C). I also left the record open after the\nhearing to receive additional relevant information. On December 1, 2008, I received\nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, which is included in the record without objection as\nAx. D. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on or about November 3, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $23,483\nfor seven delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.g). Applicant admitted with explanation the\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. He denied with explanation the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.b. In addition to the facts entered through Applicant\u2019s admissions, I have made the\nfollowing findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 30 years old and has held his current defense contractor job since\nAugust 2005. He was also employed by a defense contractor from October 2003 until\nbeing laid off after his company lost its contract in June 2005. Applicant served on\nactive duty in the United States Navy from October 1997 until October 2001. Since then,\nhe has served part-time in the Navy Reserve, and he was recalled to active duty in 2006\nfor an overseas deployment. He has held a security clearance since 1998. (Gx. 1) \nApplicant and his wife have been married since March 1998. They have two\nchildren, ages 9 and 4. His wife has worked as a benefits eligibility specialist for a state\nagency since about 2004. She had worked for another state agency but was laid off due\nto budget cuts in 2003. Thereafter, she was unemployed for about six to nine months.\nApplicant\u2019s wife also lost income because she was on extended bed rest during her two\npregnancies in late 1998 / early 1999 and in the summer of 2004. (Tr. 67, 80 - 81)\nApplicant and his wife acknowledged they did not manage their finances properly\nthrough about 2006. They assert they married too young (they were 19 years old at the\ntime), and they had no outside support from their families. Applicant admitted he was\nirresponsible when it came to his finances and that he left management of their finances\nto his wife. However, she was not disciplined enough to live within their means or pay\ntheir bills on time. When Applicant left active duty in 2001, he moved his family back to\n\n3\nthe state where he and his wife grew up. They did not plan properly for his loss of\nincome in the form of housing allowances, basic allowance for subsistence, and other\nbenefits. Additionally, he and his wife had difficulty finding employment that paid enough\nto support them and enable them to stay current on the debts they had incurred while\nhe was in the Navy. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 25 - 29, 49 - 50, 67; Gx. 2; Ax. C)\nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP in 2005, he acknowledged at least one\ndelinquent debt. A credit report obtained during his background investigation showed he\nhad multiple delinquencies dating back to 2002. More specifically, as alleged in the\nSOR, Applicant owed approximately $23,483 for seven delinquent debts. (Gx. 3) The\nstatus of those debts is as follows:\n- SOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant is paying $100 each month to BB&T for a credit card\ncharged off as a business loss. As of October 2008, the balance was reduced\nfrom $6,570 to $5,169. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 50; Gx. 2; Ax. D)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.b: Applicant repaid a $483 delinquent Capital One credit card account\nthrough a collection agency in April 2008. (Answer to SOR; Gx. 2; Tr. 16, 51)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.c: In March 2008, Applicant began making $100 monthly payments on\na delinquent loan account with the Navy Federal Credit Union. In December\n2008, he increased his monthly payment to $250, the amount owed has\ndecreased from $8,079 to $4,102. (Answer to SOR; Gx. 2; Ax. B; Ax. D; Tr. 51-\n52)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.d: A $308 debt owed to the Great Lakes Credit Union was paid off\nthrough a collection agency in April 2008. (Answer to SOR; Gx. 2; Ax. D; Tr. 53)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.e: A $566 debt owed to Hecht Company was paid off in May 2006.\n(Answer to SOR; Tr. 45 - 46; Gx. 2)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.f: Applicant disputes a Direct TV account listed as delinquent in the\namount of $118. He discontinued the service in 2001 when he moved his family\nafter leaving active duty. The creditor has no record of any debt owing or other\ninformation about Applicant. (Answer to SOR; Gx. 2; Tr. 47; Ax. D)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.g: Applicant denied he owes $7,359 after completing a lease\nagreement for a car in 2003. Applicant leased a car in 1999 and returned it as\nagreed in 2003. He was told at the time that he owed nothing further. Several\nmonths later, he received a bill for over $7,000. Applicant verbally disputed the\ndebt, but did not pursue the matter forcefully until 2008, when he began\nresponding to the government\u2019s concerns about his finances. Neither Applicant\nnor Department Counsel produced a copy of the lease agreement to determine\nApplicant\u2019s obligations. Despite the fact he disputes owing this debt, Applicant\nhas reached a settlement agreement with the law firm collecting the debt\nwhereby he will repay $2,000 in satisfaction of the debt. To that end, he has paid\n$600 and will pay the remainder with his re-enlistment bonus in February 2009.\n(Answer to SOR; Gx. 2; Ax. D) Tr. 35 - 43, 57 - 60, 71 - 72)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n4\nApplicant and his wife have a net positive cash flow each month of about $1,300\nafter expenses, including repayment of some of the debts listed in the SOR. In response\nto the government\u2019s interrogatories, Applicant submitted information that shows they\nhave been acting to pay or resolve debts in addition to those listed in the SOR. They\nhave also taken courses in financial management and budgeting skills, and have a\ndetailed system for tracking and prioritizing their monthly bills, and for making decisions\nabout their finances. (Gx. 2; Ax. C)\nApplicant has served with distinction in the Navy and Naval Reserve. He is also\nactive in his community through his work as a volunteer fire fighter, as a youth sports\ncoach, and through his church membership. Personal and professional references show\nhe enjoys a good reputation for reliability, trustworthiness and integrity. (Answer to\nSOR; Tr. 23 - 25; Ax. A; Ax. C)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n5\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6 1. Available information shows approximately $23,483 in delinquent debt for\nseven accounts attributable to Applicant since as far back as 2002. Available\ninformation shows Applicant still owes at least $11,271 for three of the debts alleged in\nthe SOR; that the debts in question have been unpaid or unresolved for several years;\nand that Applicant incurred the debts through irresponsibility and excessive use of\npersonal credit. Accordingly, the record in this case requires application of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts),\nAG \u00b6 19(b) (indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the\nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic\nplan to pay the debt), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nBy contrast, the record supports application of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6\n20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\n\n6\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), AG \u00b6 20(b)(the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), AG \u00b6\n20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control), AG \u00b6 20(d)\n(the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts), and AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue). Applicant has paid or otherwise resolved about 53% of the\ntotal debt alleged in the SOR. Additionally, as shown by the repayment of the SOR \u00b6 1.e\ndebt and by the information he submitted in response to the SOR, as early as 2006\nApplicant and his wife have been taking what action they could to pay their past due\ndebts. There is also information that shows Applicant and his wife were hindered in their\nefforts at least twice since 2004 by his wife\u2019s pregnancy-related medical issues and her\nnine month lay-off. \nAs to the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.f, Applicant supported his contention the debt is\nerroneous. As to the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.g, Applicant still denies owing the debt, but feels it\nis easier to try to pay it off than to contest it. He has reached a settlement agreement\nwith the creditor and now owes less than 25% of the original debt. Applicant\u2019s current\nfinances are sound, they have realized the importance of proper management of their\nfinances, and they will likely have paid or resolved all of their delinquencies in the next\n18 months. On balance, and in consideration of the whole person information discussed\nbelow, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by adverse information\nabout his finances. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). There has been no misconduct\nhere. Applicant is a mature adult who did not soon enough appreciate the importance of\npersonal attention to his finances. He and his wife married young and neither had lived\non their own before. Applicant was on active duty in the Navy and he felt he could leave\ntheir finances to his wife. Ten years have passed and they have personally and\nfinancially matured. Their income is steady, they are current on their obligations, and\nthey are progressing in their efforts to resolve their remaining delinquencies. More\nimportantly, Applicant is personally involved with his finances. Having also considered\nthe positive information about his reliability and trustworthiness in the community, I\nconclude his financial difficulties do not current reflect poorly on his judgment and that it\nis unlikely he will experience financial problems of his own doing. The circumstances\nthat gave rise to his financial problems are not likely to recur or cause further\ndelinquencies. \nThe positive information about Applicant\u2019s character and reliability is also\nsufficient to show that the adverse information about his finances cannot be used as a\n\n7\nmeans to pressure or coerce him into acting contrary to the national interest. A fair and\ncommonsense evaluation of this record shows that the security concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s continued suitability for access to classified information have been satisfied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\n Subparagraph 1.a - 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Continued eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E.

A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated April 29, 2008, was provided to her, \nand she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.5 Applicant did not provide additional documents within the 30 \ndays. On July 7, 2008, the case was assigned to me. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.h, 1.i, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o-1.aa, \n1.ac, 1.ag, and 1.ai. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of \nfact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old.6 She married in 1979 and divorced in 1983. She \nmarried in 1984 and divorced in 1998. She is not currently married. Her children were \nborn in 1981, 1983 and 1985. She did not serve in the military. She attended junior \ncollege for several months in 2000. She has been employed for a defense contractor in \nsecurity operations since November 2006. She has worked as a park associate from \nOctober 2002 to April 2006. She has no police record. She has not used illegal drugs in \nthe last seven years, and has never used illegal drugs while in a sensitive position.  \n \n                                                          \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n4 When she completed her SF 86, she denied she had any unpaid judgments in the last seven \nyears, and any liens against her property. See Item 4, Sections 27c and 27d. She admitted filing for \nbankruptcy in the last seven years, and her pay was garnished in September 2003. See Item 4, Sections \n27a and 27b. She also admitted having debts delinquent over 180 days in the last seven years; and  \nhaving debts currently delinquent over 90 days. See Item 4, Sections 28a and 28b.     \n \n5Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated May 2, 2008; and \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated May 5, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that \nshe had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n6Item 4 (2007 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant admitted in her SOR response at \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, that her budget \nshowed a monthly net remainder of negative $51, and that her debts were discharged \nunder Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in September 2001 (Item 3). She denied \nresponsibility for the 13 debts totaling $19,411 as listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($5,409), 1.d \n($678), 1.e ($777), 1.f ($602), 1.g ($1,197), 1.j ($678), 1.k ($111), 1.n ($5,935), 1.ab \n($79), 1.ad ($2,600), 1.ae ($70), 1.af ($79), and 1.ah ($1,196) (Item 3).  She admitted \nresponsibility for the 20 debts totaling $11,579, as detailed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h ($122), 1.i \n($156), 1.l ($128), 1.m ($5,935), 1.o ($286), 1.p ($570), 1.q ($554), 1.r ($1,170), 1.s \n($447), 1.t ($227), 1.u ($26), 1.v ($45), 1.w ($65), 1.x ($169), 1.y ($47), 1.z ($31), 1.aa \n($85), 1.ac ($41), 1.ag ($1,247), and 1.ai ($228) (Item 3).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s budget showed a gross monthly salary of $1,120, $400 from a \nboyfriend and $364 monthly from spousal support (Item 5). Her monthly net income is \n$1,763 and her expenses total $1,490 (Item 5). She pays $100 monthly on a $15,000 \ndebt and $212 on a $2,186 debt (Item 5). Her budget did not allocate funds to pay the \nSOR debts. A significant portion of her delinquent debts resulted from medical \ntreatments she received (Item 5).    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d7 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).8 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n                                                          \n7 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n8 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, her SOR \nresponse, and her response to interrogatories. After her delinquent debts were \ndischarged in 2001, she accrued 20 additional delinquent debts, totaling approximately \n$11,579. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) \nbecause she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent \ndebts.9 She receives partial mitigating credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because many of her \n                                                          \n9\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndebts resulted from medical treatment and as such constitute a condition largely beyond \nher control.   \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. Applicant received some financial \ncounseling in connection with her 2001 bankruptcy. However, there are not \u201cclear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d There is insufficient \ninformation to establish that Applicant applied the knowledge obtained from financial \ncounseling or that she showed good faith10 in the resolution of her debts. \n \nI find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d for all the debts she denied in her SOR response in the \ndecretal paragraph of this decision. There is insufficient evidence contradicting her \ndenials to prove her responsibility for those debts.  Moreover, some of them are likely \nduplications of the debts she admitted. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to the debts she \nadmitted because those particular debts are not disputed. She did not provide \n\u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or [provide] evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue\u201d with respect to the debts she admitted.   \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient correspondence with her creditors for the \ndebts she admitted to establish she acted responsibly and in good faith. She failed to \narrange payment plans (although from her budget she does not have sufficient income \nremaining to generate payments plans). Her overall conduct with her creditors casts \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Her financial \nproblems are continuing and likely to recur. She should have been more diligent and \nmade greater efforts to resolve her delinquent debts, especially after receipt of the SOR. \nShe has not carried her burden of proving her financial responsibility. Based on my \nevaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude no mitigating conditions fully \napply. \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in her favor. There is no evidence \nof any security violation. Aside from her delinquent debts (which is a civil, non-criminal \nissue), she is a law-abiding citizen. These factors show some responsibility, \nrehabilitation, and mitigation. The overall amount of her delinquent debt at about \n$11,579 is relatively low.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. Her \nChapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001 provided her with the knowledge and opportunity for a \nfresh financial start. She was well aware of her financial responsibilities. She learned of \nthe security significance of these delinquent debts when she received the SOR. Her \nefforts to resolve her delinquent debts were insufficient to fully resolve security \nconcerns. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts \nand circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d11 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n                                                          \n11See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1995. In 2000, a physician diagnosed her with chronic fatigue syndrome (Reply at 6). Based on the physician\u2019s recommendation, her command restricted her employment activities to light duty. A physician evaluated her again in 2002 and concluded her symptoms had not improved. Shortly thereafter, she was medically retired from the military and placed on the temporary disability retirement list (Reply at 13). Approximately two years later, a military physician re-evaluated Applicant (Reply at 9 through 12). Her condition had not improved. Consequently, the physician recommended that the Army change her retirement status from temporary disability to permanent disability (Reply at 12). From February 2004 through December 2006, Applicant received $776 per month in retirement and disability benefits (Reply at 2). This was approximately one third of her previous salary (Reply at 1). Consequently, she had trouble making ends meet. By early 2007, she had accrued approximately $18,000 of delinquent debt. After years of tests and treatment, Applicant\u2019s health began to improve.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn, April 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 24, 2008, admitted all of the allegations\nexcept 1.r and 1.s, and requested an administrative determination. On June 13, 2008,\ndepartment counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), and mailed it to\nApplicant. She prepared a reply on September 5, 2008. On September 24, 2008, the\ncase was assigned to me. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nOctober 24, 2008\n\nSOR subparagraphs 1.q and 1.r are duplicates (Reply, Attachment 14 at 3).\n1\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31-year-old married woman with a five-year-old child. She has a\nhigh school diploma and has earned some college credits (Item 5 at 10).\nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1995. In 2000, a physician diagnosed her\nwith chronic fatigue syndrome (Reply at 6). Based on the physician\u2019s recommendation,\nher command restricted her employment activities to light duty. A physician evaluated\nher again in 2002 and concluded her symptoms had not improved. Shortly thereafter,\nshe was medically retired from the military and placed on the temporary disability\nretirement list (Reply at 13).\nApproximately two years later, a military physician re-evaluated Applicant (Reply\nat 9 through 12). Her condition had not improved. Consequently, the physician\nrecommended that the Army change her retirement status from temporary disability to\npermanent disability (Reply at 12). From February 2004 through December 2006,\nApplicant received $776 per month in retirement and disability benefits (Reply at 2).\nThis was approximately one third of her previous salary (Reply at 1). Consequently, she\nhad trouble making ends meet. By early 2007, she had accrued approximately $18,000\nof delinquent debt.\nAfter years of tests and treatment, Applicant\u2019s health began to improve. In\nOctober 2006, she obtained a part-time job as a substitute teacher in a local school\ndistrict. In February 2007, she began working as a data entry clerk, her first full-time job\nsince leaving the Army. Within a year of obtaining this full-time job, she earned a\npromotion (Reply at 5). As of March 2008, she was earning approximately $38,000 per\nyear (Item 6 at 8).\nAs Applicant\u2019s health and employment situation stabilized, she began to focus on\nreducing her delinquencies. After consulting with a credit counselor, she began\ncontacting collection agencies, and negotiating settlements (Reply at 3). By June 2008,\nshe had satisfied the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.b through 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, and\n1.q (Reply, Attachment 12 at 5, Attachment 13, Attachment 15). In July 2008, Applicant\n1\nsatisfied the delinquency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.e (Reply, Attachment 12 at 4).\nRecently, she settled the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.f, and is awaiting the\ncreditor\u2019s confirmation (Reply at 3). In total, she has satisfied approximately $3,250 of\ndelinquent debt.\nApplicant did not recognize the creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.s. Her\nefforts at identifying it have been unsuccessful. \nApproximately $14,200 of delinquent debt, as listed in the SOR, remains\noutstanding. Four of Applicant\u2019s debts in the approximate amount of $9,950, have been\ndelinquent for more than five years (SOR subparagraphs 1.k, 1.l, 1.n, and 1.o). In April\n\n3\n2008, Applicant prepared a budget (Item 6 at 4). She continues to receive disability\nbenefits. Her net monthly disposable income after expenses to pay debt is $2,064 (Id.).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s accrual of approximately $18,000 of delinquent debt triggers the\napplication of AG & 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ and AG &\n19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d In 2000, while serving in the Army,\nApplicant suffered a disabling illness that precipitated her early discharge, and rendered\nher unable to work for nearly five years. During this period, she was unable to satisfy\nher debts with her disability retirement income.\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s health gradually improved. Shortly after obtaining a full-time job in\nFebruary 2007, she contacted creditors and began satisfying delinquencies. She has\nsatisfied approximately $3,250 of the delinquent SOR debt. \nApplicant presented no evidence that she is satisfying her debts through a formal\npayment plan. The counseling she received consisted of one phone session.\nNevertheless, she presented solid, documentary evidence demonstrating that she is\nresearching her delinquencies, organizing payment plans after she locates their\nrespective creditors, and steadily resolving them. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce,\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d AG \u00b6\n20(c ), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d and AG \u00b6\n20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts,\u201d apply.\nApplicant was unable to identify the creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.s.\nBecause the delinquency is less than $500 and she has more than $2,000 of monthly\ndisposable income, her inability to locate this creditor has minimal security significance.\nGiven Applicant\u2019s focused, organized efforts at debt reduction since returning to\nwork in February 2007, I am confident she will continue to satisfy her remaining\ndelinquencies. She has mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy a sensitive position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination must be an overall\ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole person concept.\nAlthough Applicant has been steadily satisfying her delinquencies, approximately\n$15,000 remains outstanding. The delinquencies were not caused by extravagant\nspending or financial irresponsibility. Instead, they were caused by a disabling medical\nillness that forced Applicant to retire early from the Army, and live on a drastically\nreduced income for the next five years as she struggled to overcome the illness. Since\n\nVa. Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01 246.2 (2008).\n2\n5\nreturning to work full-time, she has created a budget, satisfied approximately $3,250 of\nher delinquencies, and has approximately $2,000 of monthly disposable income to\nsatisfy the remainder. The presence of rehabilitation demonstrated by her efforts at debt\nrepayment outweighs the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress generated by the\namount of debt that remains outstanding. \nIn reaching this conclusion, I considered the fact that nearly $10,000 of\nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies are legally unenforceable because they have been delinquent\nfor more than five years. In Applicant\u2019s state, creditors are barred from initiating\ncollection actions for debts that are greater than five years old.  Although when\n2\nconsidered alone, this does not negate the security concern, it reduces the potential for\ncoercion. Upon considering this case in the context of the whole person concept, I\nconclude she has carried the burden. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.s:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F on April 21,\n2009. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 26, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\nMarch 5, 2010\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted).\nGE 1; Tr. 21.\n2\nGE 1; Tr. 26, 30.\n3\n2\non September 10, 2009, and I received the case assignment on October 8, 2009.\nApplicant specifically requested a hearing by video teleconference as he is working\noverseas. DOHA scheduled a video teleconference hearing on October 26, 2009. The\nhearing did not proceed due to connection problems. Applicant advised that he would\nbe returning to the United States for a three-week period. DOHA issued a second notice\nof hearing on November 16, 2009 and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nDecember 8, 2009. The government offered four exhibits, GE 1 through 4, which were\nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He\nsubmitted six exhibits, AE A through F, which were admitted into evidence without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 15, 2009. I\nheld the record open until January 8, 2010, for Applicant to submit additional\ndocuments.  On January 4, 2010, he submitted some documents and requested\nadditional time to submit the remaining documents. For good cause shown, I granted\nApplicant an additional 30 days to submit additional documents. Applicant timely\nsubmitted his remaining evidence. Applicant\u2019s new evidence has been admitted as AE\nG through AE K, without objection. The record closed on February 8, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and\n1.c of the SOR. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d through 1.r of the\nSOR.  He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a\n1\nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant, who is 54 years old, works in technical control for a Department of\nDefense contractor. He began his current job in December 2008 and is working\noverseas. Applicant enlisted in the United States Air Force shortly after high school\ngraduation. He retired in 1992 on medical disability - degenerative hip disease. While in\nthe military, he held a security clearance without incident. Applicant received electronics\nand information technology training during his military career.2\nApplicant married in 1981 and divorced in 1995. He has two sons, ages 27 and\n24. His sons lived with him, at times, as they grew up. He did not receive any child\nsupport from their mother. They are no longer financially dependent on him.3\n\nGE 1; Tr. 21-22.\n4\nGE 1; Tr. 21-22, 24-26.\n5\nGE 1; Tr. 22-23, 50-51.\n6\nTr. 28-30.\n7\n3\nFollowing his retirement from the Air Force, Applicant began work in 1993 in the\nelectronics and information technology industry. He worked at several companies,\ninitially earning $40,000. He accepted a position in 1997 for $80,000, moving from the\nwest coast to the east coast. A large communications company purchased his last\nemployer in late 2002. At that time, the large company cut his salary by $30,000 to\n$35,000 a year. Because of this income loss, Applicant obtained a part-time job with a\nlarge retail chain store, earning minimum wage.  \n4\nThe large company collapsed six months after the purchase, and laid-off all its\nemployees, including Applicant. Applicant received a small severance and began\nworking full-time at the retail store. He did not apply for unemployment benefits because\nhe was working full-time. After losing his job, Applicant sold his home because he could\nnot afford the mortgage payments. At settlement on the sale of his house, Applicant\nreceived $16,000. He used this money, his salary, his 401K, and his military retirement\nbenefits to pay living expenses. He still was unable to pay all his bills. His sons lived\nwith him at this time.5\nIn 2004, Applicant obtained employment with a Department of Defense\ncontractor, working in electronics and information technology. His employer deployed\nhim to Afghanistan for three years. His sons lived with their mother when Applicant\nmoved overseas. At this time, Applicant was engaged. He regularly sent money to his\nfianc\u00e9e to pay two car payments and rent. He also sent money for her to place in a\nsavings account to purchase a house. She paid the three bills, but she spent the house\nmoney on trips and gifts for friends. When he returned from Afghanistan in 2007,\nApplicant ended this relationship.   \n6\nIn September 2007, Applicant scheduled his annual physical. During this routine\nmedical examination, physicians diagnosed colon cancer. Applicant underwent\nextensive cancer treatment. He could not return to his job and did not return to work\nuntil December 2008. He received four months of short-term disability benefits from his\nemployer, but he did not receive long-term disability benefits. He used his savings and\nhis military retirement to pay basic expenses after his short-term disability benefits\nended.7\nApplicant currently earns between $90,000 and $95,000 a year. He receives\n$700 a month in retirement disability benefits from the military. Because his job requires\nhim to live and work overseas, he does not have housing costs in the United States or\noverseas. His monthly expenses include a car payment of $400 a month, which he\nvoluntarily increased to $600 a month, and parent school loan debts of $510 a month,\n\nAE F; Tr. 30, 35-36, 53, 59-60.\n8\nGE 3 (Credit report, dated October 11, 2007); GE 4 (Credit report, dated March 19, 2009); AE B (Credit\n9\nreport, dated October 6, 2009). Applicant submitted four pages from two or three different credit reports with\nhis response to the SOR. He did not submit the full reports. It appears that he obtained these reports in May\n2009.\n4\nwhich he voluntarily increased to $610 a month. His expenses for food, car insurance,\nand miscellaneous items, such as haircuts, clothing, gasoline, are estimated at $700 a\nmonth. Applicant has sufficient income each month to pay his living expenses and to\nrepay his debts.8\nThe SOR identifies numerous debts, most of which are listed at least once on\neach credit report and sometimes more than once because the debt is under other\ncreditor names. After reviewing the credit reports dated November 11, 2007, March 19,\n2009, October 6, 2009, and the SOR, I have compiled a list of the total debts owed,\nwhich are as follows:9\nSOR \u00b6\nType of Debt\nAmount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nCell phone\n$     219.00\nPaid\nAE B; Tr. 31\n1.b\nBank debt\n$12,518.00\nPaid\nAE E; Tr. 31-34\n1.c\nCredit card\n$  3,558.00\nPaid\nAE D; AE I; Tr. 35\n1.d\nEducation loan\n$12,330.00\nCurrent, paying\nAE F; Tr. 35-36\n1.e\nEducation loan\n$  7,441.00\nCurrent, paying\nAE F; Tr. 35-36\n1.f\nBank debt\n$  1,530.00\nUnpaid, debt\ndenied\nTr. 36-37\n1.g\nCredit \n$     488.00\nPaid\nGE 3; AE J; Tr. 37-\n38\n1. h\nBank debt\n$10,534.00\nPaid; same as\n1.b \nTr. 31-34\n1.i\nBusiness account\n$  8,427.00\nPaid\nAE C; Tr. 38-39\n1.j\nBusiness account\n$  7,628.00\nPaid\nResponse to SOR,\nCredit report, dated\nMay 21, 2009\n1.k\nCredit union\n$  4,543.00\nUnpaid; debt\ndenied\nTr. 39\n1.l\nCable\n$     305.00\nPaid\nAE H; Tr. 41\n\nAE B; AE C; Tr. 38-39. \n10\nAE K; Tr.41-44. \n11\nResponse to SOR; GE 3; GE 4; AE B; Tr. 41-42.\n12\nAE A; AE G; Tr. 44.\n13\n5\n1.n\nCredit account\n$   5,741.00\nUnpaid; debt\ndenied\nTr. 43\nApplicant believed he opened two accounts when he tried to establish two online\nbusinesses. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j) He paid the debt required by the creditor, who has not\nasked for additional money from him. The October 2007 credit report indicates two\nseparate accounts with two different account numbers. Applicant\u2019s evidence shows that\none account is paid. The May 2009 credit report shows the second account as not past\ndue. The October 2007 and the October 2009 credit reports show a balance on this\naccount as of November 2006 and December 31, 2006. The March 2009 credit report\ndoes not list either account. The credit reports contain conflicting information on the\nstatus of this debt. Given that the Applicant contacted this creditor and paid the\nrequested monies, I find he has paid this debt.10\nThe SOR listed four debts, \u00b6\u00b6 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.r, which are not shown on the\ncredit reports submitted as part of the government\u2019s case in chief. Applicant denied\nowing these debts. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o through 1.q are for returned checks and SOR \u00b6 1.r is for\na $78 local government account. Applicant pays his bills by debit card or credit card. He\ndoes not write checks. His son, who has the same name, acknowledged owing these\nfour debts. Accordingly, \u00b6\u00b6 1.o through 1.r are found in favor of Applicant.  \n11\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m is not shown on any of the credit reports of record.\nApplicant denied owing this debt. He believes the debt is included in his military credit\naccount and is resolved. The three credit reports show two military credit accounts\nwhich are paid. In his response to the SOR, Applicant submitted one page from a May\n21, 2009 credit report which shows this account and reflects a zero balance. The\naccount number matches the account number for one of the military credit accounts\nshown on the credit reports of record. I find that \u00b6 1.m  account and the military credit\naccounts are the same, and that Applicant does not owe any money on this debt.12\n \nIn October 2009, Applicant retained the services of a law firm to help identify and\nresolve those credit accounts he does not recognize. This firm has not yet resolved any\ncredit issues for Applicant.  \n13\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant had 18 unpaid debts totaling more than $86,000.\nApplicant has resolved or is paying 15 of these debts. He has three unresolved debts,\ntotaling $11,814. His unpaid debts represent approximately 14% of the total debts\nalleged in the SOR.\n\n6\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to\npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\n\n7\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was unable to\npay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\nIn assessing whether an Applicant has established mitigation under Guideline F,\nthe Appeal Board provided the following guidance in ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3\n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008):\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. BD. Mar. 1, 200). However, an applicant is not\nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2\n(App. BD. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d See,\ne.g.,ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2(App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can\nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and\nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the\nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a)(\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd.\nApr. 4,2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually\npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the\nSOR.\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not applicable in this case.\n14\n8\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries\nbegan around 2003. His debts continue and remain current. This mitigating condition is\nnot applicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems began when a large company purchased his employer and immediately\nreduced Applicant\u2019s salary by 40%. Six months later, the large company collapsed and\nApplicant lost his job. For the next year, Applicant worked at a low paying job. Applicant\nobtained comparable employment after a year. Over the next three years, Applicant\nsent money to his fianc\u00e9e, who spent the money to be save. In 2007, doctors diagnosed\nApplicant with colon cancer. Applicant did not work for 15 months. When he lost his job\nin 2003, Applicant sold his home because he could not pay the mortgage. He used the\nprofits from the sale and his 401K money to pay his living expenses for himself and his\nsons. He could not work while undergoing cancer treatment and again lived on his\nsavings after his disability benefits ended. When he returned to work, Applicant  began\nto save money to resolve his debts. He acted responsibly under the circumstances in\nwhich he found himself. This mitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant recently contacted a law firm to help resolve the\nthree unpaid debts listed in the SOR, as he does not believe these debts are his. As to\nthe remaining debts, he either paid the debt or developed a payment plan for the debt.\nHe showed that one debt was a duplicate and that one debt was fully paid. He is now\nfinancially sound. Mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(c) applies and AG 20(d) applies to SOR\nallegations 1.g and 1.l.14\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\n9\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nincurred significant unpaid debts caused by his unemployment, underemployment, and\nhealth issues. He paid his debts to the best of his ability during his times of\nunemployment and underemployment. When he returned to full-time work in 2008, he\nworked to resolve his debts and has resolved more than 85% of his debts listed in the\nSOR. He questions the validity of the three remaining debts. He has asked a law firm to\ninvestigate these debts to determine if the debts are his. Because he does not believe\nthese debts are his, the debts cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of\ncourse, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid: it is whether his financial\ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. While some\ndebts remain unpaid, they are insufficient to raise security concerns. (See AG &\n2(a)(1).) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances under\nGuideline F.\n\n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.r:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He falsified his security clearance application. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) (GE 1) on April 28, 2006. On July 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nDecember 15, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 23, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on September 24, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 9, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on October 27, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, \nwhich were received without objection (Tr. 35-36). Applicant testified on his own behalf \nand submitted exhibits (AE) 1 through 11, which were received without objection. I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until November 2, 2008, to submit \nadditional matters. He submitted AE 11 post-hearing. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on November 6, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, \nand 1.e-1.g. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 2.a-2.c. After a thorough \nreview of all evidence of record, including his demeanor and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old senior systems analyst. He graduated from high school \naround 1988, and has taken college courses on and off over the years (Tr. 5). He \nenlisted in the U.S. Air Force in November 1990, where he served honorably for 14 \nyears (DD 214).2 In 1993, he received access to classified information at the secret \nlevel. His access was upgraded to the top secret level in 2000 (Tr. 7). He has had \ncontinuous access to classified information since then.  \n \nApplicant married his wife, who was also serving in the Air Force, in February \n1996. They were divorced in February 2004. He has two children, a 13-year-old boy \nborn of this marriage, and a 14-year-old daughter from a prior girlfriend (Tr. 14). \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant included numerous Air Force documents \nand e-mails showing that he served with distinction. His service awards/decorations \ninclude, in part, Air Force Achievement and Commendation medals, and three Air Force \nGood Conduct medals. He distinguished himself through his dedication and hard work \nas demonstrated by his selection as non-commissioned officer of the quarter, his \nevaluation report, and numerous letters of commendation/appreciation for a job well \ndone. He was specifically commended for his professionalism, strong work ethic, \ntechnical knowledge, loyalty and maturity. Applicant\u2019s primary military occupational \nspecialty was communications and computer systems (DD 214). \n \nIn 2004, Applicant was having marital difficulties and he suspected his wife was \nhaving an affair. Seeking evidence of the affair, Applicant illegally accessed his wife\u2019s e-\nmail account in the Air Force\u2019s computer system. When she discovered that Applicant \nhad accessed her e-mail account, she complained to her command about his illegal \nintrusion.  \n \n2  See documents attached to Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn February 2004, Applicant was offered non-judicial punishment (GE 3). He \nconsulted with a lawyer, waived his right to demand a court martial, and accepted non-\njudicial punishment. In March 2004, Applicant was found guilty of violating an Air Force \ngeneral regulation by wrongfully viewing his wife\u2019s files or communications without \nappropriate authorization. His punishment included a reduction in grade to senior \nairman (E-4) (suspended), and forfeiture of $945 pay per month for two months. He did \nnot appeal his punishment.  \n \nIn August 2004, he was separated from the Air Force at the rank of staff sergeant \n(E-5) (Tr. 5-7). He was unemployed for approximately three weeks. In September 2004, \nhe began working as a senior systems analyst for a government contractor. In February \n2005, he started working for his current employer, another government contractor. \nApplicant claimed to be a valuable employee with a good record working for two \ndefense contractors. Since he started working for government contractors his gross \nsalary has been approximately over $95,000 a year (Tr. 157, GE 2). \n \nIn April 2006, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (GE 1). In \nresponse to question 23.e (asking whether in the last seven years Applicant had been \nsubject to court martial or other disciplinary proceedings under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ) \u2013 including non-judicial punishment), Applicant deliberately \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose that he received non-judicial punishment in \nFebruary-March 2004. In November 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator (GE 2). During the interview, Applicant indicated he had received no \ndisciplinary action after his wife complained about his illegal intrusion into her e-mail \naccount (GE 2). \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified he did not believe he received non-judicial \npunishment while in the Air Force (Tr. 59). He remembered being punished by his \ncommander for accessing his wife\u2019s e-mail account; however, he claimed not knowing \nhe received non-judicial punishment. His belief was based on the fact that he was \nconsidered a top non-commissioned officer (NCO), and to his recollection, his \ncommander gave him a break (Tr. 59-62). In cross-examination, Applicant denied being \nfamiliar with the non-judicial punishment process, ever recommending a subordinate for \npunishment, or ever dealing with subordinates that had received non-judicial \npunishment (Tr. 68-74). \n \nIn his answers to the financial questions, he disclosed that in the last seven years \nhe had his wages garnished to pay child support obligations (e-QIP, question 27.b), and \nthat he was participating in a financial counseling/debt consolidation program (e-QIP, \nquestions 28.a & .b). Applicant\u2019s background investigation addressed both his financial \nproblems and the omission of material information from his security clearance \napplication. \n \nApplicant explained he filed for bankruptcy protection in 1995 because he had \nlimited earnings as a new E-1 in the Air Force. His financial situation was aggravated by \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhaving to pay support for a child he had out of wedlock, and a change of station. He \ncould not to afford to pay his child support obligation, his day-to-day living expenses, \nand his outstanding debts (Tr. 34-35, 54-55).  \n \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately \n$27,000. SOR \u00b6 1.b originated from a credit union loan Applicant made to consolidate \nhis debts and purchase a car. At the time, he had received non-judicial punishment, he \nwas separating from the Air Force, and was undergoing a divorce (Tr. 105). The loan \nbecame delinquent in 2004. The total for this delinquent debt is approximately $12,250 \n(AE 1). In October 2008, the creditor accepted Applicant\u2019s offer to start making \npayments of $200 monthly beginning on November 14, 2008.   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($3,415) originated as a credit card debt, and it is still outstanding. \nApplicant settled and paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($950) on October 24, 2008 \n(AE 11). Applicant paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($968) in April 2008 (Tr. 55). \n \nWhile in the Air Force, Applicant was paid a $10,000 reenlistment bonus. When \nhe left the Air Force in 2004, the government initiated action to recoup the bonus, and \nthe debt was referred to a collection agency (SOR \u00b6 1.f ($10,134)) (Tr. 126). Applicant \nhas made no payments to the government or the collection agency (Tr. 128). After his \nsecurity clearance background interview in November 2006, Applicant contacted the \ncollection agency seeking to settle his debt. According to Applicant, the collection \nagency refused to negotiate an affordable monthly payment plan (answer to the SOR, \nTr. 54). He promised to contact the creditor again after paying other smaller debts. At \nhis hearing, he indicated he currently cannot afford to pay this debt (Tr. 132). \n \nIn May 2004, Applicant sought financial assistance/counseling through a debt \nconsolidation company (CSA). He included the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c in \nhis consolidation plan (Tr. 53). Applicant participated in CSA\u2019s debt consolidation \nprogram from May 2004 to June 2006, and paid CSA $3,019 (Tr. 57-58, AE 11 at 3-11). \nApplicant established CSA was a rogue company which took his money and failed to \npay his creditors and to assist him to negotiate and settle his delinquent debts. After he \nstopped working with CSA, Applicant did not contact the creditors again or make any \nfurther payments on these two debts until November 2008. He did not contact the \ncreditors because he did not have the financial means to pay them. \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly take home pay is approximately $3,300. His monthly \nexpenses include, in part, $1,500 in court ordered support for his two children; $950 \nrent; $95 car insurance, and around $100 car maintenance expenses. His monthly net \nremainder is approximately $700 (Tr. 700). He drives a 2001 BMW X5 SUV he \npurchased used in 2004 (Tr. 143). While married, he had purchased a GMC Yukon \nDenali, and larger luxury SUV. In 2004, because of the pending divorce he downsized \nby trading in the Yukon Denali to purchase the BMW X5 (Tr. 153). He has been paying \na $30,000 note for the last four years. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant does not have the financial means to make all his delinquent debt \npayments, child support obligations, and the day-to-day expenses associated with living \nin his state. He claimed to be making those payments he can afford (Tr. 65). Applicant \nbelieves his financial problems were the result of his divorce and his high child support \npayments (Tr. 161). His goal is to pay the small debts first and then pay the remaining \ndebts one by one. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.3 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d4 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n4  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an Applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \n \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1995. His debts were \ndischarged in 1996. In 2008, Applicant paid two of the five delinquent debts alleged in \nthe SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). He has three outstanding delinquent debts that have \nbeen charged off or in collection since around 2004-2005, totaling approximately \n$25,700. He presented some evidence of efforts to pay or resolve his legal obligations. \nHe does not have the financial means to pay his legal obligations, delinquent debts, and \nhis day-to-day living expenses. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \nand, AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. After considering all the mitigating conditions (MC), I find that AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s behavior is recent as his debts are still outstanding. \nConsidering his favorable evidence as a whole, Applicant failed to establish that his \nquestionable behavior is not likely to recur.  \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence that established circumstances beyond his control \ncontributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his divorce and separation from the Air \nForce. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but only partially. Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to \nshow he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He purchased two luxury vehicles, \napparently beyond his financial means. He made some effort to resolve his debts by \n\n \n7 \n \n \nentering into a debt consolidation program which failed through no fault of his own. After \nthe initial debt consolidation program failed in 2006, Applicant failed to take any further \naction to resolve his debts until he received the SOR. He has been consistently \nemployed since he left the Air Force with a salary of approximately over $95,000. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because, although he paid two of his delinquent debts, \nthere are no clear indications that his financial problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol. His inability to pay his debts shows he is financially overextended. Considering \nthe totality of the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s actions to repay his creditors do not raise \nto the level of good-faith efforts to resolve his debts. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. AG \u00b6 15.  \n \nApplicant failed to disclose relevant information in his answers to question 23 of \nhis security clearance application. He also falsified material facts in his statement to a \ngovernment investigator. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s testimony was less than candid. \nConsidering the record as a whole, I am convinced Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose the information. Numerous factors weighed in my analysis to reach that \nconclusion, including: Applicant\u2019s maturity, his service and employment history, his \ndemeanor and testimony, and the lack of credibility of his explanations. He served in the \nAir Force for close to 15 years, and by his own account, he was a top notch NCO. It is \ndifficult to believe Applicant did not know he received non-judicial punishment in 2004. \n \nBecause of his extensive experience in the Air Force and holding a security \nclearance, Applicant knew the importance of accurately completing his security \nclearance application and telling the truth. Nevertheless, he failed to provide information \nthat was material to making an informed security decision and made false statements. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire,\u201d applies. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns. After considering all the mitigating conditions, I find none of the mitigating \nconditions apply to this case. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 17(c), and find it does not \napply since his behavior is recent and shows Applicant\u2019s lack of reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \n\n \n8 \n \n \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well trained \nman. He honorably served 14 years in the Air Force, and has been successful working \nfor two defense contractor for four years. He has held access to classified information at \nthe secret and top secret level for approximately 15 years. Other than his illegal access \nto his wife\u2019s e-mail account in 2004, there is no evidence to show Applicant has violated \nother laws and regulations or that he ever compromised or caused others to \ncompromise classified information. Because of his rank and years of service in the Air \nForce, and his many years holding access to classified information, Applicant knew or \nshould have known the importance of the trust placed on him by the government. He \nfailed to be candid and honest on his security clearance application, during his \nbackground interview, and during his testimony at hearing. His behavior shows he lacks \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and personal \nconduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d - 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f - 1.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SCA, Item 4), on April\n24, 2007. On April 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial\nconsiderations (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken\npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006.\nMay 4, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant submitted her answer to the SOR on May 13, 2008. She requested a\ndecision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File of\nRelevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on February 19, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on\nMarch 3, 2009. Her response was due by April 2, 2009. No response was received by\nDOHA. The case file was assigned to me on April 23, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains 13 allegations under the financial considerations guideline.\nSOR 1.a. and 1.b. are federal and state tax liens. SOR 1.c. is a judgment. The next\nseven allegations identify delinquent credit card or medical accounts. The eighth\ncreditor (SOR 1.l.) was deleted from Applicant\u2019s credit report. SOR 1.m. alleges that\nApplicant did not show how she is using her net monthly remainder of $216.00 to pay\noff her overdue debts. Applicant admitted all allegations and provided explanations. She\nis 44 years old and single. In June 1987, she received her college degree in business\nadministration. She is currently employed as a technician for a defense contractor that\nshe has worked for since April 2007. Applicant has changed residence twice since April\n2004. She seeks a security clearance. \nFinancial Considerations\nSOR 1.a., $8,913, federal tax lien. The lien was filed in April 2007. Though\nApplicant technically denied the allegation, she furnished an undated copy of an Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) amended tax return (1040X) for calendar year 2002. Her\ncomputations reflect she owes $2418 in additional federal taxes. The amended tax\nreturn, the proof of payment documentation for SOR allegations 1.c. through 1.k., and\ndocumentation showing that the SOR 1.l. account was deleted from her credit report,\nare attached to Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR. See, Item 3.\nSOR 1.b., $4,028, state tax lien. Applicant supplied the same explanation in\nresponse to this allegation as she did for SOR 1.a. This allegation refers to a state tax\nlien filed three years before the federal tax lien in SOR 1.a. Applicant is still responsible\nfor this lien.  \nSOR 1.c., $6,429, judgment. The collection agency received a judgment against\nApplicant in October 2007 for medical services. On April 7, 2008, Applicant provided\ndocumentation showing she paid the debt in full. \nSOR 1.d., $1,622, credit card. Applicant provided documentation showing she\nsettled with this collection agency in May 2008 for $1,400. \nSOR 1.e., $1,578, medical account. On May 8, 2008, Applicant paid $1,597 to\nsettle the account in full.\nSOR 1.f., $116, medical account. On May 8, 2008, Applicant paid this account.  \n\n SOR 1.l. was deleted from Applicant\u2019s credit report. \n1\n3\nSOR 1.g., $583, medical account. Applicant settled the account for $528 on May\n9, 2008.\nSOR 1.h., $513, medical account. Applicant resolved this account on March 31,\n2008 with a payment of $528. On April 7, 2008, Applicant was notified this account paid.\nSee, documentation attached to Item 3.\nSOR 1.i., $127, medical account. Applicant was notified in March 2008 the\naccount had been paid in full.\nSOR 1.j., $315, medical account. Applicant also paid this account in full on March\n25, 2008. \nSOR 1.k., $453, medical account. On March 25, 2008, Applicant satisfied this\naccount in full.\nSOR 1.l., $8,345, credit card. On April 22, 2008, Applicant was notified by the\ncredit agency that the account had been deleted from her credit record. The account\nnumber in the credit agency\u2019s investigative response is the same as the account\nnumber in Item 8 (credit report dated August 24, 2007). \nSOR 1.m. In Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement (PFS), she did not show\nwhether she was using any part of her net monthly remainder of $216 to pay her\ndelinquent debts. The documentation attached to her answer (Item 3) reflects\nconsiderable activity in March and April 2008 in resolving her delinquent accounts. I find\nall allegations under paragraph 1 for Applicant. The listed debts became delinquent\nbetween 2002 and 2007. \nPersonal Conduct\nOn August 24, 2007, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA).\nIn response to question 27 requiring information about having liens placed against\nApplicant\u2019s property in the last 7 years, she answered \u201cNo,\u201d even though a lien was\nplaced against her in December 2004 and one in April 2007. Applicant also answered\n\u201cNo\u201d to question 28A, requiring information about having any debts over 180 days\ndelinquent in the last 7 years. Though Applicant does not believe she intentionally\nomitted information about her financial problems, I am unable to agree with her.\nConsidering the two liens ($12,941), and nine debts ($11,736) in the SOR total\n$24,677,  I find Applicant intentionally omitted financial information on her SCA. My\n1\nfinding is also based on her inconsistent explanations in section 4 of Item 5\n(Interrogatories and Responses), and her answer to the SOR. After intimating she may\nhave not wanted to remember her past due debts, her statement indicating she did not\nremember some of the debt, indicates to me that she remembered some of the other\ndebts. Then, in noting she had never looked at her credit report, she commented that\n\n4\nshe probably did not want to see the information in the credit report. Yet, in her answer\nto the SOR, she mentioned the lack of a credit report in reinforcing her claim she had\nunequivocally forgotten about the delinquent debts. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided no independent evidence regarding her job performance or\nreputation in the community where she lives. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\n\n5\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n\u00b618. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nFC disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand FC DC \u00b619.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) apply as the SOR shows\nApplicant owes the state and federal government $12,941 in tax liens. She owes a total\nof $11,736 to nine creditors/collection agencies. The total amount of Applicant\u2019s\ndelinquency is $24, 677. \nEvidence of financial problems may be mitigated by FC mitigating condition (MC)\n\u00b620.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment); FC MC \u00b620.b. (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances); FC MC \u00b620.c. (the person has received or\nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control); and, FC MC \u00b620.d. (the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant receives some mitigation under the third element of FC MC \u00b620.a. (\u201cor\noccurred under circumstances that is unlikely to recur\u201d) as she has satisfied most of the\ndebts except the federal and state liens. Her documented evidence of filing an amended\nfederal tax return for 2002, showing how much she believes she owes in taxes, gives\nme complete confidence she will pay the additional amount in federal taxes. Though\nshe provided no documentation regarding the state tax lien, her successful efforts in\npaying or settling the nine remaining debts in the SOR affirm my belief she will follow\nthrough on the state lien as she has with the federal lien. \nFC MC \u00b620.b., which mitigates when unforeseen events impede an applicant\u2019s\nefforts to honor his current or delinquent financial obligations, is unavailable. \n\n6\nApplicant receives some mitigation under FC MC \u00b620.c., even though there is no\nevidence of financial counseling. Paying off or settling with nine creditors in 2008,\nsuccessfully removing SOR 1.l. from her financial record, and taking responsive action\nto eliminate her federal tax lien, show clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems are being resolved. \nThe significant mitigation Applicant receives under FC MC \u00b620.d. is based on her\ndocumentation provided in SOR 1.a., and her documented pay offs of 1.c., 1.d., 1.e.,\n1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.j., and 1.k. After being advised she owed the liens and debts, she\npaid nine debts, filed documentation to address the federal lien, and successfully\nremoved SOR 1.l. from her credit report. The FC guideline is resolved in her favor.  \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n\u00b615. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \nThis guideline applies to intentional attempts to conceal or omit information from\nan SCA. I am unable to find in Applicant\u2019s favor under this guideline because there is\nnot just one or two or three debts in the SOR. Rather, the SOR contains 11 debts\ntotaling $24,677. Not having a credit report when she filled out the SCA, or not wanting\nto think about her delinquent debts, or not wanting to see what her credit report said,\ndoes not excuse her intentional behavior. PC DC \u00b616.a. (deliberate omission or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire to determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness) applies.\nThere are three mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances in this case. Those conditions are: PC MC \u00b617.a. (the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment or falsification, before\nbeing confronted with the facts); PC MC \u00b617.c. (the offense was so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and, PC MC \u00b617.d. (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur). PC MC 17.a. is not applicable as Applicant did not disclose her delinquent\ndebt history until she was confronted with the debts in March 2008 in Item 5\n(Interrogatories and Responses). PC MC \u00b617.b. is inapplicable because Applicant tried\nto conceal $24,677 in debt owed to 11 creditors. Only two years have passed since\nApplicant\u2019s intentional omission of her delinquent indebtedness. Applicant\u2019s intentional\n\n7\nomission of material financial information in April 2007 continues to cast doubt on her\nreliability and judgment. \nThough Applicant continues to deny she intentionally omitted material financial\ninformation from her SCA in April 2007, the number of delinquent accounts and the\namount of the debt convince me she knew she had some delinquent debt when she\nfilled out the security form. Her lack of candor in not simply admitting she intentionally\nomitted the information removes PC MC \u00b617.d. from consideration. The PC guideline is\nfound against Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding for Applicant under the FC guideline, but against her under the PC\nguideline. The case still must be weighed within the context of nine variables known as\nthe whole person concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the\nadministrative judge should consider the following factors: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. AG \u00b6 2(a)\nApplicant is 44 years old and single. She received a college degree in June 1987.\nShe began working for her current employer in April 2007. She provided no character\nevidence regarding her job performance or lifestyle. She furnished very credible\nevidence showing she has resolved nine out of 11 creditors, and that she has taken\nappropriate steps to resolve her federal tax lien. The actions she took to resolve her\ndebts demonstrate she is an intelligent woman. When Applicant filled out her SCA in\nApril 2007, she was 42 years old, clearly responsible for her actions. Her inability to\nacknowledge her intentional omission continues to raise questions about her reliability.\nAccordingly, Applicant has established her case under the FC guideline, but she has\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the PC guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. through 1.m.\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She has worked in some form of contracting capacity since receiving her high school diploma in 1983, she has worked in some form of contracting capacity. She has been married for 16 years and has two children. In 1992, Applicant married her current husband. The two lived comfortably and contemplated starting a family. A daughter was born in 1993 and a son was born in 1997. In the late 1990s, with two young children in her care, Applicant bought a modest family car for their safe transport. \u201c[N]ot showing very good decision making,\u201d Applicant\u2019s husband \u201cdecided he wanted a new vehicle at the same time.

On April 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating security concerns\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response notarized on June 10, 2008, Applicant admitted six and denied\nfour of the ten allegations raised concerning ten allegedly delinquent debts. She also\nrequested a hearing. DOHA received Applicant\u2019 request on July 10, 2008, and I was\nassigned the case that day. \nSeptember 30, 2008\n\nTr. 13.\n1\n Tr. 30-31; Exs. P-R (Tax documents).\n2\n2\nDepartment Counsel and Applicant agreed to an August 14, 2008, hearing date,\nand a Notice of Hearing was issued on July 17, 2008, to that effect. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted six exhibits (Ex.), accepted into the\nrecord as Exs. 1-6 without objection. Applicant submitted 9 exhibits, accepted as Exs.\nA-I without objection. Applicant gave testimony. No witnesses were called. Applicant\nwas given through August 29, 2008, to submit any additional materials. On August 27,\n2008, ten additional exhibits were submitted by Applicant via facsimile transmission. On\nSeptember 2, 2008, Department Counsel noted its receipt of Applicant\u2019s documents\nand declined to make any objections. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 4,\n2008, and the record was closed. Based upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and\ntestimony, security clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43-year-old graphics specialist who has worked for the same\ngovernment contractor since 1990. She has worked in some form of contracting\ncapacity since receiving her high school diploma in 1983, she has worked in some form\nof contracting capacity. She has been married for 16 years and has two children. \nIn 1992, Applicant married her current husband. The two lived comfortably and\ncontemplated starting a family. A daughter was born in 1993 and a son was born in\n1997. In the late 1990s, with two young children in her care, Applicant bought a modest\nfamily car for their safe transport. \u201c[N]ot showing very good decision making,\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s husband \u201cdecided he wanted a new vehicle at the same time. So he went,\nunbeknownst to [Applicant], and bought a four-wheel drive and brought it home.\u201d1\nShortly thereafter, in 1998, the couple separated for about three months. The\nhusband moved into a mobile home he had purchased while Applicant and the children\nremained in their home. The burden of maintaining two households impacted their\nability to timely meet their everyday expenses. Unable to timely pay bills and afford two\nautomotive payments, Applicant had her car returned as a voluntary repossession in\nabout 2002, and later replaced it with an older used car. Meanwhile, her husband kept\nhis new truck until it was repossessed in 2003 with a balance of $8,218. In 2003-2004,\nsurgery on the children entailed an additional burden of extra co-pays, which resulted in\nmore delinquent debts. From 2004 through 2006, Applicant and her husband underpaid\ntheir taxes, which were subsequently repaid through garnishment.  \n2\nApplicant and her husband again separated in 2006, with the husband again\nstaying in his mobile home. Expenses were even more difficult to meet during this time\nperiod because Applicant\u2019s husband, a self-employed electrician, was experiencing a\nperiod of unemployment. Consequently, it was Applicant who paid to maintain the two\nhouseholds. Applicant\u2019s husband is limited in his range of work due to a knee injury\n\n Tr. 26.\n3\n Tr. 15.\n4\n Ex. J (Letter of August 26, 2008); Ex. O (Bank Statement, dated August 26, 2008).\n5\n Ex. K (Credit Report, dated June 27, 2008). Note: In using Equifax credit reports from 2008, there is\n6\ninsufficient information on the \u201cMedical\u201d accounts to link to specific accounts, particularly when the amounts\nat issue are the same ($100). Applicant\u2019s proffer, however, shows that she has satisfied two accounts for $100\nand reduced a balance on a $450 Medical to $350. The medical group noted in Exs. K and L, which now is\nowed no balance, appears to be the medical account last reported with a $50 balance by Equifax.\n Id.\n7\n Id.\n8\n3\nwhich restricts his mobility, \u201churts all the time from going up and down stairs,\u201d and\naffects his mood.  \n3\nIn 2007, Applicant\u2019s husband completed the project he was working on. In May\n2007, exhausted from the physical aspects of his work, he unilaterally decided to take\nthe summer off and not work until September. This decision led to considerable\nfinancial distress on the part of Applicant, who became the sole household earner.4\nApplicant was thus unable to address some of their debts until after he returned to work\nin the autumn of 2007. Since returning to work, he has been hired for supervisory\npositions. He is happier in a position that does not require him to be as mobile as he\nwas previously, and supervisory positions reduce his vulnerability to knee injury pain.\nWith him now back to work, Applicant has started consumer counseling to help her pay\noff her debt.\nAt issue in the SOR, as based on a March 12, 2008, credit bureau report, are\ndebts amounting to approximately $12,800, including the $8,218 incurred by\nApplicant;\u2019s husband for his repossessed truck. \nCollection Account for $663 \u2013 Applicant has started a repayment plan on this account\nwith her first monthly installment of $25.5\nCollection Account for $585 \u2013 Applicant has returned her cable box, reducing her\nbalance to approximately $157, which she plans on satisfying at the end of September\n2008.\nMedical Collection for $100 \u2013 Paid.6\nMedical Collection for $100 \u2013 Paid.7\nMedical Collection for $450 \u2013 In repayment; balance currently at $350.8\nCollection Account for $155 \u2013 Unpaid.\n\n Id.\n9\n Exs. A-D (Letters of Reference).\n10\n Exs. G-I (Appraisals).\n11\n4\nCharge-off Account for $8,218 \u2013 This account is no longer on Applicant\u2019s credit report\nand she does not have current contact information for the creditor. She was advised by\nher credit counselor to shift her concern from this account to satisfying her smaller\ndebts first, then pursuing this account.\nCharge-off Account for $2,480 \u2013 Unpaid.\nCollection Account or $94 \u2013 Unpaid.\nMedical Collection for $50 \u2013 Paid.9\nApplicant is currently an hourly wage earner working a 40-hour week. Her gross\nincome is approximately $3,200 per month, based on an hourly wage of $20 per hour.\nHer current salary is over double of what it was in the mid- to late-1990s, when she had\nher car repossessed. Applicant rents her home from her church at approximately $750\nper month.  At work, she is known as a hard worker and a woman of faith, noted for her\nloyalty and good judgment.  She has progressed at work, both in terms of title and\n10\nsalary. Her appraisals reflect a quality worker.11\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n12\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n13\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n14\n Id.\n15\n Id.\n16\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n17\n5\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n12\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n13\n14\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n15\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n16\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n17\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n18\n6\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions\n18\nunder this guideline.  \nNot long after Applicant and her husband had their two children, Applicant\u2019s\nhusband bought a four-wheel drive truck the couple could not afford. A while later, the\ncouple separated for a period. These actions set in motion a snowball of unexpected\nexpenses and the acquisition of delinquent debt, some of which remains unpaid.\nConsequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19\u00a9) (\u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) apply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to\nAppellant to overcome the case against her and mitigate security concerns. \nAfter the birth of her children, Applicant purchased a reliable and modest family\ncar for their safe transport. Unbeknownst to her, Applicant\u2019s husband treated himself to\na four-wheel drive truck they could not afford. Recognizing this fact, it was Applicant\nwho had her car voluntarily repossessed and settled on a used car in its place. Surgery\nfor the children was unexpectedly required and the couple was twice separated. During\ntheir latter separation, Applicant maintained two household as the sole wage earner\nduring her husband\u2019s period of unemployment. When Applicant\u2019s husband unilaterally\ndecided to take a break from work for several months, it was left to Applicant to once\nagain support the household. Despite a number of unexpected events of financial\nsignificance, Applicant has done her best to keep her family together and make sure\nthat their most essential bills were paid. This included taking full responsibility for the\ncouple\u2019s IRS arrearage. Given these facts, Financial Considerations Mitigating\nCondition (FC MC) 2, AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies.\nPart of the drain on Applicant\u2019s finances was compensating for her husband\u2019s\ncaprices and periods of unemployment, neither of which reflected badly on her. Now\nhired for supervisory positions, he is no longer required to be as physically active as he\nonce was. As a result, his bouts of knee pain have diminished and he has an improved\nattitude and mood. He has been back to work in this capacity for nearly a year without\nincident. Given his new status as a supervisor, it is unlikely he will repeat his own past\nbehavior. Consequently, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, AG \u00b6\n20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\n\n7\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) applies. \nAlthough not noted as a debt of concern in the SOR, Applicant and her husband\nowed back taxes. Applicant took on those debts directly and satisfied them as her first\npriority. With her husband committed to his return to work, she feels she can now make\nsignificant progress on her delinquent debts. With the help of a credit counselor, she\nhas learned to prioritize her debts. One creditor which she cannot locate has been\nmoved down the list. Meanwhile, she has addressed the delinquent medical accounts.\nShe has commenced work on her cable account by returning the cable box, significantly\nreducing her balance. She has started a repayment plan with one of the credit cards.\nHer efforts demonstrate her commitment to satisfying the couple\u2019s debt. Such actions\ngive rise to FC MC 4, AG \u00b6 20(d), (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) and FC MC 3, AG \u00b6 20\u00a9) (\u201cthe person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\npublic trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a well regarded employee who shows talent and quality in her work.\nShe is a devoted mother who goes to great lengths to balance her roles as wife,\nmother, and worker. Money apparently became tight after the birth of her two children,\nbut the couple seemed to manage until Applicant\u2019s husband bought a new truck without\n\n8\nfirst consulting her. The burden of paying car payments on two new vehicles was too\nmuch. Rather than have him return the more expensive vehicle, she kept the peace and\ndemonstrated both sound judgment and self control by returning her family car and\ngetting a used model. From that time until late 2007, Applicant served as the family\u2019s\neconomic anchor while the couple twice flirted with separation and her husband was\ntwice unemployed. Indeed, she single handedly took on the couple\u2019s back taxes as a\npriority and has paid them in full.\nAt issue is an amount of delinquent debt under $13,000. Nearly two-thirds of that\ndebt, $8,218, is the balance owed on a truck acquired by Applicant\u2019s husband without\nher knowledge or consent. For her part of that debt, none of the balances owed are for\nfrivolous purchases. Applicant has seen her family through hard times with a minimum\nof delinquent debt. She has systematically reduced the balance owed on the remainder\nof that delinquent debt by about 20%, demonstrated a good faith effort to address all\nher obligations, shown that family resources are now improved with her husband\u2019s\nreturn to full-time employment in a job he can better manage, and shared her insights\non how she methodically plans to address the rest of her debt with the help of her credit\ncounselor. Although her efforts are far from complete, Applicant has shown her\ncommitment to meeting her obligations. Throughout the past six years, she has\ndemonstrated that she has self-control, sound judgment, and a commitment to abiding\nby the rules. With security concerns mitigated, I conclude it is clearly consistent with\nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.:I:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.:j:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He \nhas adopted the United States as his country and relinquished his Sudanese \ncitizenship.  \n \n \nRegarding his three friends who live in the UAE, he considers them good men \nwith whom he went to college and they decided to move back to their birth place.  \n \n \nHis sister and brother-in-law moved to the UAE because the living conditions \nwere very bad in Sudan.  \n \n \nApplicant stated in his answer to the SOR that he has lived in the United States \nfor 14 years, went to college, paid taxes and owned a home. He has worked with the \nU.S. government overseas. No other information was provided.1 \n \n \n \n \n \n1 Item 3. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nSudan2 \n \n \nIn 1953 the United Kingdom and Egypt concluded an agreement that provided for \nself-government for Sudan. After a transitional period, Sudan became independent in \n1956. Since then they have experienced years of civil war with efforts to bring about \npeace. In 2005, a Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed, establishing a new \nGovernment of National Unity and the Interim Government of Southern Sudan. The \ninterim period allowed for the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \nand elections at all levels. The key provisions of this agreement have faltered. \n  \n \nA rebellion in Darfur resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of persons there \nand has led to an estimated two million internally displaced persons in Sudan. The \nSudanese Government is accused of being complicit in the bombing, murder, and rape \nof innocent displaced persons from Darfur. The Sudanese President has demonstrated \na continued refusal to honor his commitment to end the violence in Darfur. \n \n \nIn 1993, the U.S. Secretary of State designated Sudan as a state sponsor of \nterrorism and they continue to remain on the list despite pursuing terrorist operations \ndirectly involving threats to U.S. interests. Sudan is under a broad U.S. embargo with \nextensive trade restrictions on exports to Sudan. The United States considers Sudan a \nthreat to national security and the foreign policy of the United States  \n \n \nSudan\u2019s human rights record is poor and there are numerous serious abuses, \nincluding, extrajudicial and other unlawful killings by government forces, torture, \nbeatings, rape, and other cruel and inhumane treatment by security forces. There are \narbitrary arrests and detentions, executive interference with the judiciary, and denial of \ndue process, restrictions on citizens\u2019 privacy, and restrictions on freedom of speech, \npress, assembly, religion, and movement. The U.S. State Department continues to warn \nagainst all travel to Sudan. It also has indicated that terrorists are known to operate in \nSudan and seek opportunities to carry out attacks against U.S. interests. In addition, \nanti-American sentiment is prevalent and Americans are warned to exercise the utmost \ncaution in Sudan. \n \nUnited Arab Emirates3 \n \n \nThe UAE is a federation of emirates, each with its own ruler. The federal \ngovernment is a constitutional republic, headed by a president and council of ministries. \nTraditional rule in the UAE is generally patriarchal with political allegiance defined in \nterms of loyalty to tribal leaders. There are no democratically elected legislative \ninstitutions or political parties, and no general elections. Only 15-20% of the UAE\u2019s \npopulation are UAE citizens. The remaining population includes significant numbers of \nother Arabs, including many Iranians. The government of UAE has expressed fears that \n \n2 Item 5. \n \n3 Item 6. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe large Iranian\u2013origin community in the Dubai emirate could pose a threat to UAE \nstability.  \n \n \nThere are problems in the UAE with regard to human rights, including, arbitrary \narrests and indefinite incommunicado detention, government restriction on civil liberties, \na lack of judicial independence, political organizations and political parties. Labor unions \nare illegal and private associations must follow censorship guidelines and receive \ngovernmental approval before anything is published.  \n \n \nThe UAE does not recognize dual nationality, and UAE authorities have \nconfiscated U.S. passports of dual nationals.  \n \n \nThe United States and UAE have had friendly relations since 1971. The UAE \ncontributes to the continued security of the Persian Gulf, and is a partner against \nterrorism. However, the UAE is one of only three countries that recognized the Taliban \nas the legitimate government of Afghanistan and two of the September 11, 2001, \nhijackers were from the UAE. The UAE\u2019s cooperation in counterterrorism operations to \ntarget persons suspected of smuggling cash from terrorist-source countries has been \nmet with resistance. Dubai, in the UAE, has been the key transfer point for illicit sales of \nnuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. There have also been cases of \nillegal export, or attempted illegal export, of U.S. restricted, dual use technology to the \nUAE, including products with potential nuclear and military applications. \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to or safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered the following:  \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s mother, two brothers, a sister and an \nuncle are citizens and residents of Sudan. He traveled to Sudan in 2006 to visit his \nfamily. He has a sister and brother-in-law who are citizens of Sudan and residents of \nUAE. He traveled there to visit them in 2006. He acknowledges he stays in contact with \nhis family and feels an obligation and responsibility to support them. He provided \napproximately $30,000 in financial support to his family. His relationship with his family \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation, and also creates \na conflict of interest because his continuing relationships are sufficiently close to raise a \nsecurity concern. Therefore, I find disqualifying conditions (a) and (b) apply. Applicant \nhas a friend who is a citizen and resident of the UAE, another friend who resides in the \nUAE, whose citizenship is unknown, and a third who is a citizen of the UAE, residing in \nthe United States. Regarding Applicant\u2019s friends, I find both of the above disqualifying \nconditions also apply. \n \nI have also analyzed all of the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions \nfor this security concern under AG \u00b6 8 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \nApplicant admitted he maintains contact with his family and friends in Sudan and \nthe UAE, and he feels an obligation and responsibility towards his family. He provides \nthem financial support. He did not offer sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcerns. Applicant has not met his burden of establishing that it is unlikely he will be \n\n \n7 \n \n \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of his family and friends \nliving in Sudan and the UAE, and the interests of the United States. His contacts with \nfamily and friends in Sudan and the UAE could potentially force him to choose between \nthe two.  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the foreign government, or the \ncountry is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. Sudan is \na designated state sponsor of terrorism, has a poor human rights record, and has \nterrorists known to operate within its borders. The UAE, although it has friendly relations \nwith the U.S., has human rights problems and has been uncooperative in addressing \nterrorist operations within its borders. It has been the key transfer point for illicit sales of \nnuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. There have been cases of illegal \nexport, or attempted export of U.S. restricted dual use technology to the UAE, including \nproducts with potential nuclear and military applications. The burden of persuasion is on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his contacts in Sudan and the UAE do not pose a security \nrisk, and he is not in a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the U.S. and \nhis family and friends. With Sudan and the UAE\u2019s negative human rights record and the \nterrorist operations within their borders, it is conceivable that Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers and friends could be vulnerable to coercion. Applicant has not met his burden. \nI find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. \n \nApplicant has been a U.S. citizen since 2005. He failed to provide sufficient \ninformation about any family ties he may have in the United States. He maintains \ncontact with his family in Sudan and the UAE. He failed to provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate his contacts. He did not offer sufficient evidence regarding his relationship with \nhis friends who are citizens of the UAE or who live there. Considering Sudan and the \nUAE human rights record and the potential conflict of interest, I find there is insufficient \nevidence to apply mitigating condition (b).  \n \nSecurity concerns are reduced where contact and correspondence with foreign \ncitizens are casual and infrequent because the risk of foreign exploitation or pressure is \nless. Applicant visits and provides financial support to his family. These contacts are not \ncasual and infrequent. He failed to provide sufficient evidence about his relationship \nwith his friends. I find mitigating condition (c) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has been a U.S. citizen \nsince 2005 and is working for a defense contractor as a linguist overseas. He feels a \nresponsibility and obligation towards his family who are citizens and residents of Sudan \nand the UAE.4 He has friends who are citizens of or reside in the UAE. He did not \nprovide sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns raised by these contacts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for Foreign \nInfluence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.j: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 Applicant provided financial support and visited his family in Sudan and the UAE.I find these facts are \nnot disqualifying, but are evidence of his close relationship with his family.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Applicant answered the SOR 5 June 2008, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n1\nassigned the case to me 25 June 2008, and I convened a hearing 29 July 2008. DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) 6 August 2008.\nSeptember 5, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the Guideline G allegations. She is currently a 44-year-old\nbio-metrics program manager employed by a defense contractor since 1994. She seeks\nto retain the clearance she has held since March 1989.\nApplicant has an extensive history of excessive alcohol consumption that first\nsurfaced as a security concern in November 2000. During a subject interview she\ndisclosed that she drank 2-3 glasses of wine every day, drinking every 4-6 weeks to the\npoint of intoxication. She had not had any alcohol-related incidents, but claimed to be\nwatchful of her drinking habits because of a history of alcoholism in her extended family.\nHowever, she considered her drinking habits European rather than American (G.E. 5).\nClearance adjudicators apparently agreed, as she continued her clearance.\nHer excessive alcohol consumption again surfaced as a security concern in May\n2003. During preparation for a polygraph examination at another government agency,\nApplicant revealed that she was currently drinking a bottle of wine by herself everyday.\nShe later reported to one of her counselors that she had been drinking a bottle or more\ndaily from December 2002 to May 2003 (G.E. 7). Encouraged by the agency to seek\nassistance for her alcohol issue, she enrolled in a 28-day inpatient treatment program in\nJuly 2003, where she was diagnosed as alcohol dependent. She completed the\ninpatient treatment successfully, and moved into the outpatient aftercare program.\nAlthough the outpatient program required her to abstain from drinking alcohol, Applicant\nrelapsed twice in September 2003 (G.E. 7), a fact she disclosed to her outpatient\ncounselor, who in turn reported it to the other agency. According to Applicant, she was\nnot initially aware that attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was a required, not\noptional, part of the aftercare program. When she learned that it was, she began\nattending AA as required.  Nevertheless, the other agency considered her to have not\ncompleted the treatment program, and revoked her access to classified information in\nJuly 2003. Applicant thought about appealing that decision, but did not.\nFrom July 2003 to February 2005, Applicant participated in a long-term aftercare\nprogram, where she was also diagnosed as alcohol dependent. Although she was\nrecommended to abstain totally from alcohol consumption, she had resumed drinking\nshortly after leaving the inpatient program. In November 2003, she was arrested for\nDUI, with a blood alcohol content (BAC) of .15%. Part of her sentence included\nattending AA meetings. In March 2004, Applicant reported to her psychiatrist that she\nwas working on the fourth step of AA (G.E. 6). However, she stopped attending\noutpatient aftercare in January 2005. In April 2005, she told her psychiatrist that after\ncoming home from an evening of drinking, she got into a fight with her husband that was\nso loud that her neighbor heard it, and later contacted her about it. In July 2005, she\nreported that her going out drinking with her friends was causing friction with her\nhusband. He wanted her to at least drink at home to avoid driving while intoxicated.\nNevertheless, in February 2006, she was again arrested for DUI, with a BAC of .14%.\nThe resolution of these charges included probation that does not end until May 2009\n(G.E. 9).\n\n3\nApplicant continues to consume a glass of wine with dinner five to seven nights\nper week. She also has ongoing medical (hyperthyroidism) and psychological\n(depression) issues that are largely controlled when she takes her medications properly,\nbut which have otherwise contributed to her alcohol problems from time to time. The\nunderlying factors contributing to her psychological issues include being beaten by her\nbaby sitter when she was three, being molested by a cousin, having date-rape\nexperiences, multiple affairs with married men while she was also married, and at least\none suicidal gesture.\nApplicant states that she has never had a security violation, and feels like she\nhas been presumed guilty until proven innocent. Yet, she acknowledges that the facts of\nher case meet the stated security concerns under alcohol consumption. She\nacknowledges that she has been recommended to abstain from alcohol consumption. In\nFebruary 2008, she told her psychiatrist that she had not been going to AA, but was\ngoing to resume. She did not. She last consumed alcohol the night before her hearing.\nShe claims that she can go without alcohol, but she does not.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline G\n(Alcohol Consumption).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v.

Applicant failed to mitigate\n3\nthe security concerns, and meets none of the mitigating factors. Applicant\u2019s alcohol\nproblems are both recent and frequent. She has not accepted her alcoholism and\nremained abstinent. She is neither engaged in a program making satisfactory progress,\nnor following recommended treatment recommendations with a favorable prognosis.4\nWhile Applicant recognizes her mistakes of drunk driving, she otherwise lacks insight\ninto how her alcoholism has effected her life. With no rehabilitation program in place,\nnot only can I not conclude Applicant is unlikely to abuse alcohol in the future, I\nconclude that she is at significant risk to resume abusive alcohol consumption.\nAccordingly, I resolve Guideline G against Applicant.\nA whole person assessment of Applicant results in the same conclusion.\nApplicant notes that she has never had a security violation. But the government is not\nrequired to wait for a security violation before it acts on its security concerns, and\nApplicant provided no independent evidence of either her work or her character to\nbolster her argument. I noted her medical and psychological issues not as an\n\n5\nindependent basis for denying her access to classified information, but to demonstrate\nthat her life has additional issues in her life not immediately addressed by the SOR that\nmust incline any whole person assessment further against her. She should not have\naccess to classified information.\n.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn February 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines H, Drug Involvement and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 17, 2008, and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on April 29, 2008. DOHA issued \na notice of hearing on May 20, 2008, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on \nJune 4, 2008. The Government offered Exhibit (GE) 1, which was received without \nJune 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, but did not submit documentary \nevidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 16, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a Bachelor \nof Science degree awarded in June 2007. He has been with his current employer since \nJuly 2007. He is single with no children.1  \n \n \nApplicant first smoked marijuana in about 2000, when he was in high school. He \ncontinued to smoke marijuana on an occasional basis until about 2002, when his \nmarijuana use increased to about once or twice a month. He also experimented with \nmethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as \u201cecstasy,\u201d on about \ntwo occasions in 2001, and he used psilocybin mushrooms about two times in 2002 to \n2003.2  \n \n \nApplicant decided during his last semester of college that he would stop taking \nillegal drugs. He has not used any illegal drugs since March 2007. He stated \nunequivocally that he will never use illegal drugs again. His employment is in a different \ncity than where he went to college. His current friends and associates do not use \ndrugs.3  \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), \ncertified as true on October 4, 2007.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse; and \n \n(b) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug possession5 and use are sufficient to raise the above potentially \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \nTwo Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n \n                                                          \n5 Drugs must be possessed in order to be used. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant admitted using illegal drugs up until March 2007. His drug use was too \nrecent for him to receive the benefit of AG \u00b6 26(a). He made a conscious decision to \nstop using illegal drugs in March 2007. He graduated college and obtained a good job \nwith an established company. He no longer associates with people who use drugs. He \nis willing to sign a statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any \nviolation. AG \u00b6 26(b) is applicable.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use constituted criminal activity. This raises both of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \nFour Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant last used illegal drugs in March 2007. That is too recent to apply AG \u00b6 \n32(a). There is no evidence that Applicant was unduly pressured or coerced into using \n\n \n6 \n \ndrugs. AG \u00b6 32(b) is not applicable. Applicant stopped taking drugs, graduated college, \nand obtained a good job. That is evidence of rehabilitation. AG \u00b6 32(d) has been raised \nas a factor for consideration.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 24 years old. He \npresented himself as someone who has matured and moved past the experimentations \nof youth. He has been completely forthright about his drug use throughout the process. I \nfound him to be a truthful, credible witness. However, he chose to break the law every \ntime he used illegal drugs. That causes a concern. While he is clearly headed in the \nright direction, he simply does not have a sufficient track record of drug-free, law-\nabiding living at this time to justify the granting of a security clearance. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug use \nand criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Since 2000, he has worked for a defense contractor as an information technology security auditor (Item 5 at 6). He has held a security clearance since 1990 (Item 5 at 34). Applicant was born in Mexico. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1989 (Item 5 at 2). There is no record evidence documenting when he emigrated to the U.S. Under Mexican law, Applicant\u2019s Mexican citizenship lapsed when he became a naturalized U.S. citizen (Item 10). In 2000, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s grandfather died, and her family offered to sell him his house located in Mexico. Applicant accepted the offer, but was initially unable to purchase it because Mexican law limits property ownership to Mexican citizens (Item 6 at 10). He then re-applied for Mexican citizenship through the consulate in the United States, and purchased the property, after the Mexican government approved his application. The house is worth approximately $60,000 (Item 6 at 8). Applicant maintains a bank account in Mexico to pay the house\u2019s utility bills (Item 6 at 8). When he travels to Mexico to visit relatives, he stays at the house (Item 6 at 11). The visits last approximately three days. He has visited Mexico approximately 16 times in the last 10 years.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 8, 2008, and requested an administrative\ndetermination. On June 17, 2008, department counsel prepared a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM). Applicant received it on June 25, 2008, and did not reply.

He earned an associate\u2019s degree in electronics technology in 1989. Since 2000,\nhe has worked for a defense contractor as an information technology security auditor\n(Item 5 at 6). He has held a security clearance since 1990 (Item 5 at 34).\nApplicant was born in Mexico. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1989\n(Item 5 at 2). There is no record evidence documenting when he emigrated to the U.S.\nUnder Mexican law, Applicant\u2019s Mexican citizenship lapsed when he became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen (Item 10).\nIn 2000, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s grandfather died, and her family offered to sell him his\nhouse located in Mexico. Applicant accepted the offer, but was initially unable to\npurchase it because Mexican law limits property ownership to Mexican citizens (Item 6\nat 10). He then re-applied for Mexican citizenship through the consulate in the United\nStates, and purchased the property, after the Mexican government approved his\napplication.\nThe house is worth approximately $60,000 (Item 6 at 8). Applicant maintains a\nbank account in Mexico to pay the house\u2019s utility bills (Item 6 at 8). When he travels to\nMexico to visit relatives, he stays at the house (Item 6 at 11). The visits last\napproximately three days. He has visited Mexico approximately 16 times in the last 10\nyears. Under Mexican law, dual nationals entering or departing Mexico must identify\nthemselves as Mexican (Item 8 at 2). \nApplicant voted in the 2006 Mexican presidential election. He viewed the\nexercise of his Mexican voting rights as \u201can opportunity to influence a positive outcome\non the presidential race\u201d (Item 6 at 6) by voting for the party \u201cthat aligns more closely\nwith the interest of the USA\u201d (Answer at 2). Applicant is willing to renounce his Mexican\ncitizenship, if required, to receive his security clearance (Item 6 at 10).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\nThe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\n1\n3\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Influence\n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States\u201d (AG \u00b6 9).\nPreference for a country need not be motivated by political or ideological reasons to\nhave negative security implications (ISCR Case No. 98-0476 (App. Bd. December 14,\n1999) at 5). Here, Applicant re-applied for Mexican citizenship, 15 years after becoming\na naturalized U.S. citizen. He did so in order to exercise the privilege, limited to Mexican\ncitizens, of purchasing property in Mexico. He pays the utility bills for the property using\na Mexican bank account, and he voted in the 2006 Mexican presidential election. AG \u00b6\u00b6\n10(a), \u201cexercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming\na U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member,\u201d 10(a)(7), \u201c voting in\na foreign election,\u201d and 10(b), \u201caction to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign\ncitizenship by an American citizen,\u201d apply.\nApplicant\u2019s willingness to renounce his dual citizenship triggers the application of\nAG \u00b6 11(b).  His willingness to renounce his Mexican citizenship was only conditional.\n1\nAbsent any evidence of steps taken to renounce dual citizenship, the applicability of this\nmitigating condition has minimal probative value.\nApplicant\u2019s vote in the 2006 Mexican presidential election was motivated by his\ndesire for Mexico to re-elect a pro-American president. Although his motive was\nadmirable, it does not trigger the applicability of any of the mitigating conditions. The\nmost relevant mitigating condition, AG \u00b6 11(f), requires the vote in a foreign election to\nbe encouraged by the U.S. government. Applicant did not provide evidence of any such\nencouragement.\nApplicant has failed to mitigated the foreign preference security concern.\n\n4\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUpon considering the whole person factors, I conclude it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified\ninformation. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 22, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated May 25, 2006.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On February 3, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 11, 2009, and June 26, 2009,\nand requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to the\nundersigned Administrative Judge on July 2, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on\nJuly 6, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 11, 2009.  Applicant requested a\ncontinuance that was granted and the hearing was rescheduled for August 27, 2009.\nThe Government offered ten exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 10,\n\n2\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant offered two exhibits, referred to as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B, which were received without objection.  He also testified\non his own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on September 10,\n2009, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.  The\nApplicant submitted eight Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibits 1 though 8, which were admitted without objection.  The transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) was received on September 4, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nhis testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 48 years old and has a Bachelor\u2019s\nDegree in Electrical Engineering and is pursuing his Masters.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor as an Electrical Engineer and is seeking to obtain a security\nclearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR, namely that\nhe was indebted in the amount of approximately $17,000.00 in delinquent debt.  Credit\nReports of the Applicant dated August 22, 2002; May 20, 2008; December 10, 2008;\nApril 3, 2009; and August 20, 2009; collectively reflect each of the outstanding debts\nlisted in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10).  The Applicant has been\nemployed for a defense contractor since September 2000.\nThe Applicant and his wife were married in 1998.  At that time, their financial\ncredit had no blemishes.  Newly married, they were confronted with the costs of starting\nup a new home, and relocating from out of state to start new jobs.  They had planned on\ntwo incomes to support their move.  Unexpectedly, Applicant\u2019s wife fell ill and was\ndiagnosed with Manic Bipolar disorder.  She went through several years of instability\nwhere she was hospitalized a number of times.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 7).\nPart of her illness involved her charging up credit cards without considering the\nconsequences of her actions.  The Applicant became financially overextended.  The\noriginal delinquent debt totaled approximately $36,000.00.  Applicant has worked hard\nto resolve all but two of the debts.   \n\n3\nThe Applicant explained that prior to his wife\u2019s diagnosis, he and his wife entered\ninto an agreement with an adoption agency to attend parenting classes in hopes of\nadopting a child some day.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  Applicant and his wife never\ncompleted the program because she became mentally ill, and they decided to rethink\nthe idea of adoption.  As of December 2008, a debt in the amount of $1,150.00 for the\ncost of the classes remained owing.  The Applicant failed to pay the debt and it was\nwritten off by the creditor.  Applicant hired a consumer credit counselor who has\ncontacted the credit reporting agencies and requested that the debt be removed from\nhis credit report.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 4).  \nAs of December 2008, a debt in the amount of $126.00 owed to a dentist for\nservices was outstanding.  Applicant initially thought the debt should have been paid by\nhis insurance but eventually gave in and made the payment to the dentist.  By that time,\nhowever, the debt had been placed into collection and was never credited to the proper\naccount.  Applicant submitted a copy of the receipt for payment indicating that the\nbalance is now zero.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 5).  The debt has been removed\nfrom the Applicant\u2019s credit report.  \nAs of December 2008, a debt in the amount of $16,736.00 owed to a car\ncompany remained owing.  The Applicant explained that when his wife started spending\nmoney they could not afford to spend, the Applicant took the car off the road and\nstopped paying for insurance.  Although he continued to make the payments, he was so\nfar upside down on the loan, he decided to voluntarily turn in the car in 2003.  Applicant\ncontends that the statute of limitations has run and therefore he is not legally obligated\nunder the law of that state to pay the debt.  Applicant also contends that even though\nthe statute has run, he is still trying to make good on the loan.  Applicant testified that he\ntried to get a bank loan to pay off the car or a personal loan from family members but\nhas not been successful.  The Applicant is currently trying to get the creditor to settle for\n$8,368.00, which is half of what he originally owed on the account.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\n6).       \nThe Applicant explained that he has done his best to manage he and his wife\u2019s\ndebts.  He has tried to stay current, and has looked for loan consolidation, in order to\nresolve them more efficiently.  (Tr. p. 44).  He is current with all of his regular monthly\nexpenses and plans to keep it that way.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 8).\nAn undated letter of reference by an individual, who has worked closely with the\nApplicant since 1995, indicates that he considers the Applicant to be trustworthy,\nreliable and capable.  Applicant is said to be sober minded and that he has been a solid\ntechnical contributor to the work effort.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).   \n\n4\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances:\n20(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts. \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n\n5\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility, which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\n\n6\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence also shows that circumstances largely beyond the Applicant\u2019s\ncontrol contributed to his financial indebtedness.  An out of state job relocation and the\ncost of starting up a new home might have been expected, but his wife\u2019s unexpected\nmental illness and its ramifications, the unexpected medical expenses associated with\nher illness, and her inability to work, primarily caused their financial problems.  Since\nthen, the Applicant has paid off many of his delinquent debts.  Recently he has hired a\ncredit consumer counselor to further assist him in cleaning up his credit.  He must\ncontinue to demonstrate financial responsibility.  Under the circumstances, the Applicant\nhas done his best to be responsible and has made a good faith effort to resolve his\ndebts.  He realizes that he must continue to pay off his delinquent debt and live within\nhis means in order to pay his bills on time.  In the event that he has any future financial\nproblems, his security clearance would immediately be in jeopardy.  However, at the\npresent time, considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  \nUnder Guideline F, Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts and, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  However,\nMitigating Conditions 20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances, 20(c) the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control and, 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, his\nfavourable character references and the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the\nguidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement,\ntrustworthiness, reliability, candor, a willingness to comply with rules and regulations, or\nother characteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \n\n7\nThere is evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  The Applicant has\ninitiated a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts.\nAccordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 2.a, and his admissions are incorporated herein. Based on the record as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been married since 1986. He and his wife have four children, ages 21, 19, 16, and 14. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering, and he has worked for the same company or its predecessor in interest since 1982. He is currently working as a senior software engineer. He is seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to him by the Defense Department. He has a history of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related criminal conduct, which he does not dispute. Indeed, he reported the 2006 alcohol-related treatment and the 2006 alcohol-related incident on his security-clearance application, which he completed in April 2007 (Exhibit 1). During January\u2013March 2006, Applicant obtained counseling for his use of alcohol (Exhibit 3\u2013personal subject interview). He did so because he was worried that he was depending too much on alcohol and it was affecting his life. He enrolled and 3 successfully completed an outpatient program where he attended group sessions for three hours per day for three days per week.

The\naction is based on Applicant\u2019s history of excessive alcohol consumption\u2014to include a\ndiagnosis of alcohol dependence as well as both inpatient and outpatient\ntreatment\u2014and two alcohol-related incidents of criminal conduct during the period\n2006\u20132008. The record contains substantial evidence of reform and rehabilitation such\nas: (1) Applicant has abstained from alcohol for the last 13 months; (2) he successfully\ncompleted inpatient and outpatient programs in 2008, and he has a favorable prognosis;\n(3) he is actively participating in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA); and (4) his last alcohol-\nrelated incident, the April 2008 drunk-driving charge, was resolved in February 2009,\nwhen he pleaded guilty and accepted responsibility for his misconduct. Taken together,\nthese circumstances mitigate the security concerns. Accordingly, as explained in further\ndetail below, this case is decided for Applicant. \nAugust 10, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition to the Executive\nOrder and Directive, this case is adjudicated under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining\nEligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December\n29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective September 1,\n2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.\nThe Directive is pending revision or amendment. \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on February 5, 2009. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details the\nfactual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline G for\nalcohol consumption and Guideline J for criminal conduct, and it recommended\nsubmitting Applicant\u2019s case to an administrative judge for a determination to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on March 9, 2009, and he requested a hearing. The\ncase was reassigned to me on May 1, 2009. The hearing took place as scheduled on\nJune 4, 2009. The testimony of several witnesses was taken, and Government Exhibits\n1\u20136 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A\u2013L were admitted. The transcript (Tr.) was received on\nJune 12, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c,\nand 2.a, and his admissions are incorporated herein. Based on the record as a whole,\nthe following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been married\nsince 1986. He and his wife have four children, ages 21, 19, 16, and 14. He has a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering, and he has worked for the same company\nor its predecessor in interest since 1982. He is currently working as a senior software\nengineer. He is seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to him by the\nDefense Department. \nHe has a history of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related criminal\nconduct, which he does not dispute. Indeed, he reported the 2006 alcohol-related\ntreatment and the 2006 alcohol-related incident on his security-clearance application,\nwhich he completed in April 2007 (Exhibit 1).\nDuring January\u2013March 2006, Applicant obtained counseling for his use of alcohol\n(Exhibit 3\u2013personal subject interview). He did so because he was worried that he was\ndepending too much on alcohol and it was affecting his life. He enrolled and\n\n3\nsuccessfully completed an outpatient program where he attended group sessions for\nthree hours per day for three days per week. According to Applicant\u2019s interview, he\nreceived a diagnosis of alcohol abuse. Applicant did not drink alcohol while participating\nin the program, and he passed random alcohol tests given during this period. He\ncontinued with his sobriety for several more months until December 2006.\nHe started drinking beer about one to two weeks before an incident with his wife.\nHis habit was to drink a six-pack of beer at home after work. On or about December 18,\n2006, Applicant and his wife argued. He had drunk a six-pack before the argument\nbegan. His wife threatened to call his mother during the argument. In turn, Applicant\ngrabbed the cell phone from his wife and threw it against a wall. His wife was not hurt,\nbut she called the police who promptly arrived and arrested Applicant. He spent the\nnight in jail and his wife picked him up the next day when he was released. The matter\nwas resolved in court in early 2007, when Applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of\ncriminal damage of less than $150, and he elected to attend sessions of domestic-\nviolence counseling. He was also placed on unsupervised probation for six months.\nThis incident caused Applicant to abstain from alcohol. He also attended AA\nmeetings three to four times during the work week and twice on weekends. He had\nbeen sober for about nine months when he was interviewed to discuss the criminal\ndamage offense in September 2007 (Exhibit 3\u2013personal subject interview).\nHe  began drinking beer again on about April 5, 2008. He resumed drinking in\nresponse to stress and anxiety he was experiencing due to one of his child\u2019s health\nproblems. Three days later on April 8, 2008, he drank a 24-ounce beer he bought on the\nway to work that morning. He was involved in a traffic accident (hitting traffic cones)\nwhile preparing to enter the gate to the company. Security officers suspected Applicant\nwas intoxicated and contacted the police. His blood-alcohol content was measured at\nnear the legal limit of 0.08. Subsequently, he was charged with driving under the\ninfluence (DUI) of alcohol. \nThe DUI charge was resolved in February 2009, when he pleaded guilty (Exhibits\n2 and D). He was sentenced to, among other things, 12 months of unsupervised\nprobation, ordered to pay fines and costs of about $1,800, and served four days in jail.\nHe will serve probation until February 2010. No action has yet been taken against his\ndriver\u2019s license. \nThe DUI charge set off a series of events. The next day his company disciplined\nhim for violating company rules and regulations and required him to enter into a last-\nchance agreement (Exhibit I). His company also reported the incident as adverse\ninformation to the Defense Security Service (Exhibit 5). \nFrom April 21 to May 14, 2008, Applicant received inpatient treatment for his use\nof alcohol. The program was based in a residential treatment center for people with\nchemical dependency. He successfully completed the program (Exhibit E). \n\n4\nIn early June 2008, Applicant began working with his company\u2019s employee-\nassistance program (EAP) as mandated by the company. As of December 18, 2008, he\nwas in full compliance with all requirements of the EAP (Exhibit 2), and the record\ncontains no evidence of subsequent noncompliance. \nAfter completing the inpatient treatment, he then was enrolled in an intensive\noutpatient program (Exhibit G). The 90-day outpatient treatment program was through\nhis company\u2019s EAP. He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent. The program included 30\ngroup sessions, attending AA meetings, and working with a sponsor. He successfully\ncompleted the program in August 2008, and thereafter he has attended an aftercare\nmeeting once a week (Exhibits F and G). \nApplicant has received a favorable prognosis. A primary therapist (who is a\nlicensed alcohol counselor) at the outpatient program opined in a letter dated June 2,\n2009, that Applicant is making his recovery a priority, and she thinks he will remain\nsober if he continues to follow the recovery plan (Exhibit G). Applicant\u2019s physician, in a\nnote dated June 3, 2009, reported that Applicant has been sober for 13 to 14 months,\nhis blood work is normal, and his prognosis is excellent (Exhibit H). \nApplicant is actively participating in AA (Tr. 73\u201374). He has a sponsor who has\nbeen sober for more than 20 years (Exhibit C). His sponsor has observed that Applicant\nis focused on sobriety in a serious way, and the sponsor believes that Applicant will\nremain sober. \nApplicant appears to have fully immersed himself in AA\u2019s 12-step program and is\nactively working it. For example, he was able to recite from memory the 12 steps (Tr.\n91\u201393). A friend and fellow AA member, with 28 years of sobriety via AA, described the\nchanges and progress he has seen in Applicant as \u201cextraordinary\u201d (Tr. 33). He believes\nApplicant has made \u201cphenomenal progress\u201d (Tr. 34). He believes Applicant has been\n\u201cvery compliant\u201d with AA\u2019s program. \nApplicant is a highly successful employee (Exhibits A, B, J, K, and L). He was\nrecently selected to participate in a corporate-level program that focuses on the\narchitecture and design of large-scale systems within the company. This program\nrequires Applicant to travel to another part of the country, and he makes sure he attends\nAA meetings when he does so. In addition, a senior engineer and a department\nmanager appeared as witnesses, and both vouched for Applicant\u2019s knowledge, skills,\nand abilities, as well as for his trustworthiness and reliability. The senior engineer\ndescribed Applicant as the \u201cgo to person\u201d to get work done (Tr. 49). The department\nmanager described Applicant as \u201cprobably my very best section head\u201d and an \u201cexcellent\nstaff member\u201d (Tr. 61). \n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n2\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n3\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n4\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n5\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n10\n5\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a security clearance\ndecision is to decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nA favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted a security\nclearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An unfavorable\n2\ndecision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security clearance, and (3)\nprevents access to classified information at any level.  \n3\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n4\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy V. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n5\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n6\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n7\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n8\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n9\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.10\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n11\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n12\n Revised Guidelines at p. 15. \n13\n Revised Guidelines at p. 21. \n14\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 15\u201316 and 21\u201322 (setting forth the security concerns and all the disqualifying and\n15\nmitigating conditions). \n6\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.11\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met\n12\nthe strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security\nclearance.\nAnalysis\nThe alcohol consumption and criminal conduct concerns will be discussed\ntogether because the record shows the concerns are factually related or connected to\neach other. Under Guideline G, the concern is that \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption\noften leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses,\nand can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d  And\n13\nunder Guideline J, the concern is \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person's\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d14\nUnder the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct guidelines,  the following\n15\ndisqualifying conditions are raised by the record:\n\u2022\nalcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents\nof concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent;\n\n7\n\u2022\nhabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent;\n\u2022\ndiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence;\n\u2022\nevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social\nworker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program;\n\u2022\nrelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an\nalcohol rehabilitation program; \n\u2022\na single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n\u2022\nallegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person\nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and \n\u2022\nindividual is currently on parole or probation. \nThe guidelines also provide that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate\nthe concerns. The following mitigating conditions are raised by the record: \n\u2022\nthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse,\nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if\nan alcohol abuser);\n\u2022\nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or\nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and\nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with\ntreatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics\nAnonymous or a similar organization, and has received a favorable prognosis by\na duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a\nstaff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program; and \n \n\u2022\nthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement. \nThe record contains substantial evidence of Appellant\u2019s history of excessive\nalcohol consumption and alcohol-related criminal conduct. The evidence includes the\nfollowing: (1)  his alcohol-related incident in 2006, when an argument with his wife\nresulted in a guilty plea to a charge of criminal damage and a sentence that included six\nmonths of unsupervised probation; (2) outpatient treatment in 2006, when he received a\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 1\u20132. \n16\n8\ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse; (3) his alcohol-related incident in 2008, when he was\narrested for DUI, for which he is now serving probation until February 2010; and (4)\ninpatient and outpatient treatment in 2008, during which he received a diagnosis of\nalcohol dependence. Clearly, Applicant\u2019s history of excessive alcohol consumption\ncaught up with him during 2006\u20132008, and the results were predictable. Moreover,\nApplicant\u2019s drinking-and-driving is viewed with extreme disfavor because it is a high-risk\nactivity that endangers the public, which shows a serious lack of good judgment. Simply\nput, a man of his age and experience should know better. \nThe record contains substantial evidence of successful reform and rehabilitation,\nto include Applicant\u2019s abstinence from alcohol since April 2008, a period of about 13\nmonths when the record closed. He successfully completed both inpatient and\noutpatient treatment, and he is continuing to attend aftercare meetings once a week. He\nattends AA, has a sponsor, and is actively working AA\u2019s 12-step program. \nApplicant has a good employment record. This is shown by his selection to\nparticipate in a corporate-level program as well as by the endorsements and support he\nreceived from several company employees (Exhibits A, B, J, K, and L). These are\nprofessional people who work in the defense industry and are likely to be careful when\nmaking such endorsements.  \nThe criminal conduct is now resolved for the most part as well. It took nearly a\nyear for Applicant\u2019s DUI case to come to conclusion in the state court system, but\nApplicant accepted responsibility for his misconduct by pleading guilty. Although he is\non unsupervised probation until February 2010, the concern here is lessened because\nthere are clear indications that Applicant has his alcohol problem (the basis for the\ncriminal conduct) under control.  \nI also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept, which requires\nan administrative judge to evaluate a person\u2019s eligibility by considering the totality of the\nperson\u2019s conduct and all the surrounding circumstances. An administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in the Revised Guidelines as\nfollows: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n16\nLife is difficult, and the record contains substantial evidence that Applicant\nbrought serious difficulties upon himself by his use of alcohol. Things have improved\ndramatically for Applicant. He has made substantial progress in addressing his alcohol\nproblems, he knows he suffers from alcoholism, he has provided substantial evidence of\n\n Revised Guidelines at p. 3. \n17\n This paragraph is not intended to suggest a conditional decision. Instead, it is intended to inform Applicant\n18\nthat he will be subject to periodic review, and the Defense Department may take action against him based on\nnew information. \n9\nhis actions taken to address this problem, and he has established a pattern of\nabstinence for 13 months. At the hearing, Applicant impressed me as a serious\nindividual who is focused on maintaining his sobriety and fulfilling his family and work\nresponsibilities. On balance, I am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol problems\nand alcohol-related criminal conduct is a thing of the past and will not be of concern in\nthe future. \nIn addition to the whole-person concept, there are additional factors to consider.\nBecause Applicant is currently eligible for access to classified information, it is proper to\nconsider if he (1) was truthful and complete in responding to questions, (2) sought\nassistance and followed professional guidance, (3) resolved or appears likely to\nfavorable resolve the security concern, and (4) has demonstrated positive changes in\nbehavior and employment.  All four factors weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n17\nI found Applicant truthful and credible during the hearing, and I have seen\nnothing in the evidentiary documents to undermine his credibility. He sought\nprofessional assistance after the 2008 DUI, he successfully completed inpatient and\noutpatient programs in 2008, he is continuing in aftercare, and he is participating in AA.\nIn other words, he is doing everything he can do to address his alcohol problems. He\nalso has gained a new insight or understanding into his use of alcohol, something that\ndid not take place in 2006. This development is important because it serves to\ncounterbalance or neutralize the argument that Applicant is likely to have a relapse as\nhe did in the past. The relapse argument is also counterbalanced by Applicant\u2019s last-\nchance agreement with his company and his participation in the company\u2019s EAP.\nLikewise, since he now has his alcohol problem under control, it is likely that he will\nfavorably resolve his unsupervised probation without violation. All these circumstances,\ntaken together, amount to positive changes in behavior and  weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nThese circumstances also support my conclusion, noted above, that Applicant\u2019s history\nof alcohol problems and alcohol-related criminal conduct is a thing of the past and will\nnot be of concern in the future. \nAlthough I am deciding this case for Applicant, he should not conclude that the\nreview of his eligibility for access to classified information is over. Like any clearance\nholder, Applicant is subject to a periodic reinvestigation as required by his level of\naccess. Moreover, his company is required to report new adverse information as it has\nin the past. And Applicant would be well advised to understand that future incidents of a\nsimilar nature will in all likelihood result in revocation of his security clearance.   \n18\nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines G and J. Applicant met his ultimate\n\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.c:\n \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.     \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 35 years old and has been an electronics technician for a defense contractor for about 18 months. He is single and has an associate's degree in electronics. Applicant entered active duty with the Navy in 1992 directly from high school. He served on active duty until 2000 in information technology, and left active duty with an honorable discharge as a petty officer second class (E-5). After leaving the Navy, he worked for various defense contractors for short periods of time. He was unemployed for times when the defense contractors ended or lost contracts. He has held a security clearance for the last 18 years since entering the Navy (Tr. 23- 26; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated May 30, 2007). Applicant's monthly net pay, depending on the amount of overtime, is $3,400 to $4,000, with monthly expenses of approximately $2,000, leaving $1,400 to $2,000 monthly in discretionary or disposable funds. Applicant's father has been ill lately and Applicant is assisting him with his needs. Most of Applicant's present discretionary funds are used to assist his father. This leaves him most months with about $500 in disposable funds (Tr. 37-40, 48-50). Applicant has not received any financial counseling, even after filing a bankruptcy petition in 2004 (Tr. 35- 36).

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) to update his security clearance on May 30, 2007.  On July 24, 2008, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for \nApplicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations under Guideline F.  \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 28, 2008. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 16, 2008.  He admitted five \nand denied two of the allegations under Guideline F.  He provided proof of payment of \nthe two debts he denied.  He requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 27, 2008, and the case was \nassigned to me the same day.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 3, 2008, \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nfor a hearing on November 20, 2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The \ngovernment offered six exhibits, marked government exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 6, \nwhich were received without objection.  Applicant submitted 5 documents, marked \nApplicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A-E, which were received and admitted to the record \nwithout objection.  Applicant testified on his behalf.  The record was left open for \nApplicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant timely submitted one additional \ndocument marked App. Ex. G  The government did not object to the admission of the \ndocument (See Gov. Ex. 7, Department Counsel Letter, dated December 9, 2008), and \nthe document was admitted into the record.  DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on December 2, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and has been an electronics technician for a defense \ncontractor for about 18 months.  He is single and has an associate's degree in \nelectronics.  Applicant entered active duty with the Navy in 1992 directly from high \nschool.  He served on active duty until 2000 in information technology, and left active \nduty with an honorable discharge as a petty officer second class (E-5).  After leaving the \nNavy, he worked for various defense contractors for short periods of time.  He was \nunemployed for times when the defense contractors ended or lost contracts.  He has \nheld a security clearance for the last 18 years since entering the Navy (Tr. 23- 26; Gov. \nEx. 1, e-QIP, dated May 30, 2007).  Applicant's monthly net pay, depending on the \namount of overtime, is $3,400 to $4,000, with monthly expenses of approximately \n$2,000, leaving $1,400 to $2,000 monthly in discretionary or disposable funds.  \nApplicant's father has been ill lately and Applicant is assisting him with his needs.  Most \nof Applicant's present discretionary funds are used to assist his father.  This leaves him \nmost months with about $500 in disposable funds (Tr. 37-40, 48-50).  Applicant has not \nreceived any financial counseling, even after filing a bankruptcy petition in 2004 (Tr. 35-\n36). \n \nCredit reports show that Applicant had the following delinquent debts; a judgment \nto an insurance company for $5,614 (SOR 1.a); a judgment on a personal loan debt for \n$5,540 (SOR 1.b); a collection account for a rental car agency for $843 (SOR 1.c); a \ncredit card account charged-off for $418 (SOR 1.d); a judgment on a personal loan for \n$425 (SOR 1.e); a collection account for a cell phone of $79 (SOR 1.f); and a Chapter 7 \nBankruptcy filed on April 2, 2004, and discharged on May 9, 2005 (SOR 1.g).  Applicant \ndenied the debts in SOR 1.a, and SOR 1.e since they were paid (Gov. Ex. 2, Credit \nReport, dated July 4, 2007).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.a is a judgment for $5,614 in favor of an insurance \ncompany.  Applicant provided sufficient information in response to the SOR to show \npayment of the debt (See Response to SOR, Letter, dated August 5, 2006). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.b is for a judgment on a personal loan for $5,540.  When \nhe left the Navy and started working for defense contractors, Applicant had periods of \n\n \n3 \n \n \nunemployment and difficulty meeting his financial obligations.  He volunteered at his \nchurch and met a woman who was also a volunteer.  She offered to assist him \nfinancially a number of times but Applicant at first did not accept the offer.  When his \nfinancial problems become acute, Applicant did accept the offer.  He and the women \nwere not romantically involved but Applicant believed the woman wanted to be involved \nwith Applicant romantically.  When this did not happen, he and the woman became \nestranged.  He did not know how to repay the loan and did not know the woman had \nfiled a judgment until he received the SOR.  He had moved and the notice of judgment \nwas sent to a former address.  After learning of the judgment from the SOR, Applicant \ntried to contact the woman to make arrangements to pay the loan.  He has not been \nable to contact her since she does not return his phone calls.  He is sending her $20 per \npay period at her last known address as a good-faith effort to pay the loan.  He is \ncontinuing his efforts to contact the woman and will make larger payments when he can \ncontact her (Tr. 26-33, 43-44; App. Ex. D, Money Orders, dated September 23, 2008. \nOctober 20, 2008, and November 19, 2008; App. Ex. F, Money Order, dated December \n5, 2008).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.c is an account in collection for a car rental fee of $843.  \nApplicant rented a car for an individual who was to pay the rental fee.  The individual did \nnot pay the rental charges and the rental car company entered a judgment for $843 \nagainst Applicant as the individual responsible on the rental agreement.  Applicant did \nnot know of the judgment until he received the SOR.  He is making $20 bi-weekly \npayments as requested by the rental car company.  He plans to increase payment when \nhe receives his year-end bonus and tax refund (Tr. 19-20, 44-45; App. Ex C, Money \nOrders, dated September 23, 2008. October 20, 2008, and November 19, 2008; App. \nEx. F, Money Order, dated December 5, 2008).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.d is for a charged off credit card account of $418 (Tr.33-\n34).  Applicant tried to contact the company but could not reach an individual to help \nhim.  He has an address for the company and is making $20 good-faith payments on \nthe debt.  He will increase payments when he can finally talk to a representative of the \ncompany.  He intents to continue to contact the company and pay off the remainder of \nthe debt as soon as he can using his year-end bonus and tax refund (Tr. 45-46; App. \nEx. App. Ex E, Money Orders, dated September 23, 2008. October 20, 2008, and \nNovember 19, 2008; App. Ex. F, Money Order, dated December 5, 2008).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.e is a judgment on a personal loan for $425.  Applicant \npaid this judgment in 2004 (Tr. 18; Case File, Response to SOR, dated August 16, \n2008; App. Ex. B, Letter. Dated August 6, 2004 and Bank Cancelled Check, dated \nSeptember 13, 2004). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.f is for cell phone account in collection for $79.  Applicant \ncontacted the company for information on the account and was informed that they were \nunable to document the account.  The company waived any debt and ceased collection \naction (Tr. 16-18; App. Ex. A, Letter, dated August 19, 2008). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.g is for a bankruptcy filed on April 2, 2004.  After leaving \nactive duty in the Navy, Applicant started working for defense contractors.  Applicant \nwas laid of from employment with the defense contractors as they finished or lost \ncontracts with the government.  He was unable to pay his debts because of the lack of \nsteady employment and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  His debts were discharged in \nMay 2005 (Tr. 35-36; Gov. Ex. 3, Bankruptcy discharge, dated May 9, 2005). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n5 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  The delinquent debts that Applicant admits and are listed on the credit \nreport are a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions \n(FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\", and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) \"a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\".   \n \n \nApplicant raised mitigating circumstances for his debts by his testimony.  I \nconsidered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) \"the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\" and it  has some application.  Two \nof the debts were paid off years ago and are not current debts.  Three of the other four \ndebts are being paid.  The remaining debt of $79 was just waived by the creditor.  Since \nthere are debts still being paid, there are current debts.  Applicant's debts were \ndischarged by bankruptcy in 2004.  Applicant frequently encountered delinquent debts \nsince there are a variety of debts from a credit card, personal loans, a car rental, and a \ncell phone bill.  Applicant initially encountered financial difficulty, but he is now solidly \nemployed in the civilian workforce and his debts are under control.  His financial \nproblems should not recur.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\" applies.  Applicant encountered financial \n\n \n6 \n \n \nproblem when first entering the civilian workforce.  He has taken positive steps to \nresolve those issues.  He paid some of the debts and he filed a bankruptcy petition to \nresolve his debts.  Applicant did not know about the judgment against him on a personal \nloan.  He did not know of a charged-off debt for a rental car he rented for someone else \nwho was to pay the rental bill.  He did not know of the charge-off credit card debt but \nhas attempted to contact the creditor.  Once he learned of the existence of these debts, \nhe contacted the creditors the best he could and started payment plans on his own.  He \nacted responsibly under the circumstances to control and manage his debts. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) \"the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under \ncontrol\" does not fully applies.  Applicant has not received any financial counseling, \neven as part of his bankruptcy action.  However, his financial problems are being \nresolved and are under control meeting this prong.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\" partially applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is \nneeded.  Applicant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a strong desire to pay \nthem, and has shown a good-faith effort to pay them.  Applicant paid two of the six \ndelinquent debt years ago.  He has a payment plan and is paying under that plan on \nthree of the other debts until he can make better plans with the creditors.  He contacted \nthe creditor for another debt and the debt was waived because there is no record of the \ndebt.  When he first encountered financial problems, he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nand the debts were discharged in 2004.  Bankruptcy is a legal and permissible means of \nresolving indebtedness. Applicant has not incurred additional delinquent debts since the \nbankruptcy discharge.  Applicant acted responsibly towards his debts, and established \nhis good-faith efforts to resolve his debts.  He mitigated security concerns for his \nfinancial situation \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant's eight years \nof active duty in the Navy and that he has successfully held a security clearance for \nover 18 years.  Applicant encountered financial problems when leaving active duty and \nentering the civilian workforce.  He paid two of the debts year ago.  He filed a \nbankruptcy action and his debts were discharged in 2005.  He was not aware of his \nother delinquent debts until the SOR, but acknowledges his legal obligation to pay them. \nHe has payment plans for three of them and the fourth for $79 was waived for lack of a \nrecord of the debt.  Applicant lives within his means and meets his personal financial \nobligations.  His actions do not indicate poor self control, lack of judgment or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.  He is not financially overextended, and \nhis finances do not create a security concern.  Overall, on balance the record evidence \nleaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 12, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 25, 2010, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge \non July 13, 2010, and reassigned to me on August 4, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of \nJanuary 31, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing on August 18, 2010, as amended on August 19, 2010, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on September 14, 2010. The Government called two witnesses \nand offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 13, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Exhibits (AE) A1 through M, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 21, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor. He served \non active duty in the United States military from 1977 until he was honorably discharged \nin 1988. He served in the reserves from 1988 until 2005. He seeks to retain his security \nclearance. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree. He was married and \ndivorced three times before he married his current wife. He does not have children.2 \n \n \n \nApplicant served as a reservist in a subordinate unified command (SUC) from \n1990 through 2000. He served overseas and also worked at the command \nheadquarters, which was located outside the continental United States (OCONUS). His \nofficer evaluations indicate that he performed active duty for 17 days in 1995, 17 days in \n1996, 17 days in 1997, and 13 days in 1998. He also \u201cdrilled\u201d during other periods \nearning points for retirement. He was promoted to pay grade O-5 in 1996. He worked in \nthe military intelligence (MI) field and held various titles and positions within the \ncommand. For a period, he performed duties as a Special Security Officer (SSO) for a \ntask force and assistant SSO for the SUC. Because of his education, background, and \ncivilian experience, he was \u201ctasked to identify and implement solutions to intelligence \ncollection, analysis and dissemination problems requiring acquisition and employment \nof advanced technology systems.\u201d3  \n \n \nAt some point, Applicant was attached to a reserve detachment that supported \nthe SUC. The detachment was located in a state that was far from where Applicant \nlived. The original mission of the detachment was to provide the SUC a pool of reserve \npersonnel available to augment the SUC headquarters staff positions during the \nreservists\u2019 two-week annual training periods. The mission of the detachment evolved to \nwhere their personnel were training and deploying with combat units.4   \n \n \nThe SOR in this case is based upon a letter of reprimand Applicant received from \nhis reserve commander in January 2005. The SOR alleged that Applicant executed \ndocuments and correspondence for the purpose of misleading state and local law \nenforcement offices by 1) issuing courier orders, 2) authorizing military concealed carry \nof weapons, 3) falsely stating the mission of the detachment, 4) assisting in the renewal \nof a civilian concealed carry weapons permit, and 5) misrepresenting that he was \n                                                          \n1 AE A has many attachments.

You did this to assist \nanother [service member] in obtaining permits to possess illegal weapons \nand to facilitate unauthorized training by members of [detachment]. Your \nactions falsely reflected endorsement by the Department of Defense and \n[subordinate unified command]. \n \nYou are hereby reprimanded. You were derelict in your duties when you \nissued courier orders, authorized military concealed carry of weapons, \nfalsely stated the mission of the [detachment], and assisted in the renewal \nof a civilian concealed carry weapons permit. You were also derelict in \nyour duties when you represented yourself as involved in the test and \nevaluation of weapons and ammunition on behalf of [subordinate unified \ncommand].5 \n \nThe specific allegations in the SOR and the letter of reprimand are addressed \nindividually below. \n \n \nThe SOR and letter of reprimand state that Applicant was derelict in his duties \nwhen he issued courier orders. In 1995, he issued courier orders to an officer from the \ndetachment (Officer A), who was then in the pay grade 0-2. The orders authorized the \nofficer to carry classified documents between the command\u2019s headquarters and \nnecessary destinations. The orders were for an indefinite period. Applicant signed the \norders as the command\u2019s Deputy Special Security Officer. Applicant admitted that he \nsigned the courier orders using the standard form letters that he received from the \ncommand. The command SSO wrote an affidavit certifying that he was aware that \nApplicant issued the courier orders and he approved of the action. In April 1998, \nadditional courier orders were issued to Officer A to transfer computer and hard drives \nfrom the SUC\u2019s OCONUS location to his detachment\u2019s location in the United States. \nThe orders were effective for the day that Officer A flew with the equipment and were \nsigned by another SUC officer in the pay grade O-5.6 I find Applicant was acting within \nthe scope of his duties as SSO when he issued the courier orders to Officer A in 1995.  \n \n \nIn October 1996, two military cards were issued to Officer A, who had been \npromoted to O-3, authorizing him to carry a concealed .45 caliber pistol and a 9 \nmillimeter (mm) pistol \u201cin connection with his official duties.\u201d The cards were valid from \nOctober 1996 through October 1997. The cards bore a signature that is strikingly similar \nto Applicant\u2019s signature. Applicant denied any memory of signing the cards. He stated it \nwas very unlikely that he signed the cards because the cards report Officer A as having \na middle initial, and everyone involved with the unit knew that Officer A did not have a \n                                                          \n5 GE 5.  \n \n6 Tr. at 53-55, 103-106, 111-112, 137; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE A.1.2, A.1.2.5, E, \nF, I, K, L. \n\n \n4 \n \nmiddle name. As proof of that assertion, Applicant submitted an officer evaluation for \nOfficer A that did not list a middle name or initial. There are other documents in \nevidence, including the federal charges against Officer A and his death record, that \nreport officer A with the same initial or a middle name that starts with the same letter as \nthe initial on the weapon\u2019s cards. The dates on the cards do not coincide with \nApplicant\u2019s 17 days of active duty in 1996. That does not preclude the cards from being \nsigned while drilling. The authority to issue the cards was questioned because the \ncards, even if valid, should only have been issued for the short period that Officer A \nserved on active duty with the SUC, not for a full year. The cards were only supposed to \nauthorize the carrying of official military weapons. It is unclear if the .45 caliber and 9 \nmm pistols were military-issued weapons or Officer A\u2019s personal weapons.7   \n \n \nThe SOR and letter of reprimand state that Applicant was derelict in his duties \nwhen he assisted in the renewal of a civilian concealed carry weapons (CCW) permit. In \nJanuary 1997, a letter was sent to the chief of police of Officer A\u2019s hometown using \nletterhead with the seals of the Department of Defense and the SUC. The letterhead \ncontained the name of the SUC, Applicant\u2019s directorate, and his branch. It also included \nthe detachment and that it was \u201cAirborne.\u201d The street address was in the geographic \nlocation of the detachment. Applicant\u2019s name and rank were printed on the letter and \nthe signature appeared to be Applicant\u2019s. The letter thanked the chief of police for his: \n \npersonal attention and unequaled professional courtesy in securing a \nconcealed weapons permit for [Officer A]. The camaraderie you extended \nto [Officer A] is deeply appreciated by this Directorate and by [SUC]. Your \nactions help to ensure the safety of a highly valued federal officer and \nclearly exemplify the highest standards of mutual respect and cooperation \nwhich we, as professional officers, strive to achieve.8 \n \nThe reserve commander who issued the letter of reprimand questioned the designation \nof the detachment as \u201cAirborne,\u201d and several other irregularities in the letterhead.9 \n \n \nIn March 1998, a memorandum \u201cTo Whom It May Concern\u201d with the subject \n\u201cNotice to State and Local Authorities\u201d was issued. The memorandum used letterhead \nwith the seals of the Department of Defense and the SUC. The letterhead contained the \nname of the SUC and the detachment. The detachment line on the letterhead included \nthe designation \u201cABN,\u201d short for Airborne. Applicant\u2019s name and rank were printed on \nthe memorandum, and the signature appeared to be Applicant\u2019s. Applicant denied \nsigning the memorandum. Officer A\u2019s name was contained in the memorandum, listing \nthe middle initial that was on the military weapons cards.10 The memorandum stated: \n \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 56-57, 112-118, 170-172; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 12; AE A.1.3.1, A.1.3.4, J, \nM.  \n \n8 GE 5.  \n \n9 Tr. at 57-59, 125-126; GE 5; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.  \n \n10 Tr. at 59-63; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5.  \n\n \n5 \n \nDuring the period 15 March 1998 through 15 March 1999, [Officer A] will \nbe on special assignment in the continental United States, conducting \nofficial business for the [SUC], as commander of the [detachment]. \n \nLocal and state officials are requested to extend to [Officer A] the \ncourtesies generally granted to a United States Federal Officer. At all \ntimes, when he is in possession of DD Form 2501, Courier Authorization, \nno attempt should be made to detain the service member, to search the \nservice member or his possessions, to confiscate any possession of the \nservice member, to view any material being carried by the service member \nother than identifying documents, or to otherwise impede the service \nmember in performance of his duties. Such interference or obstruction \nmay be deemed a felony under federal law.  \n \n[Officer A] may be identified by a valid military identification card, DD Form \n2, Geneva Conventions Identification Card. When armed, he will comply \nwith [military regulation controlling carrying of weapons and use of force \nfor law enforcement and security duties] and will carry a [military weapons \ncard] signed by a field grade officer. The document will be presented to \nlegal authorities who question the carrying of weapons.11 \n \n \nIn March 1999, a letter was written with letterhead with the seals of the \nDepartment of Defense and the SUC. Applicant\u2019s name and rank were printed on the \nletter, and the signature appeared to be Applicant\u2019s. Applicant denied signing the letter. \nThe letter requested assistance in the renewal of Officer A\u2019s CCW permit. The request \nstated that Officer A was assigned to the SUC and he served as a \u201ccourier of classified \nDepartment of Defense material in the United States.\u201d The letter stated that Officer A \nwas in possession of a military form authorizing him to carry concealed weapons while \nconducting official duties. It further stated that members of the detachment often are \nrequired to conduct official duties in civilian attire and are required to carry firearms to \nprotect documents and materials:12  \n \nI wish to avoid chance encounters with Police officers who in the past \nhave threatened our couriers with deadly force. To alleviate these \nsituations, I have requested all personnel in possession of [military \nweapons card] to also obtain concealed carry permits from local law \nenforcement authorities and I have encouraged close coordination of our \nactivities with local law enforcement.13   \n \n \nThe letter of reprimand states Applicant was derelict in his duties when he \nrepresented himself as involved in the test and evaluation of weapons and ammunition \non behalf of the SUC. By invitation, Applicant traveled to a weapons manufacturer\u2019s \n                                                          \n11 GE 5.  \n \n12 Tr. at 64-67, 70-71; GE 5; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.  \n \n13 Id. \n\n \n6 \n \nfacility to test fire a prototype firearm and ammunition. In May 1999, he wrote a letter to \nthe weapons manufacturer using letterhead with the seals of the Department of Defense \nand the SUC. The letterhead contained the name of the SUC and Applicant\u2019s section, \nbut the address was a post office box in Applicant\u2019s city of residence. He requested \ninformation on the production status of the weapon system. He wrote that he had \nprovided some of the ammunition to various components of the SUC for evaluation and \ndistributed the unedited videotape of the test firing. Applicant admitted writing the \nletter.14 The letter contained the following warning that Applicant stated was provided by \na lawyer from the SUC: \n \nPlease note that this communication is a simple request for information. It \nis not intended to constitute an offer of any kind or commit the United \nStates to the purchase of any material or service. I can state, however, \nwith caveat in place, that the [ammunition] and the [manufacturer\u2019s] \nweapon system are of great interest to me and other [SUC] officers and \nmen, and that we thoroughly appreciate the lethality and versatility your \nweapons and ammunition offer. \n \nI encourage you to continue your unique and insightful weapons system \ndevelopments and request you provide me with your projected date for \nentry into Low Rate Initial Production for the [weapon].15  \n \n \nThe letter of reprimand included copies of all the documents discussed above \npurporting to be signed by Applicant. It advised Applicant that the commander would \nconsider any matters submitted by Applicant before making the decision whether to \nrecommend the filing of the letter in Applicant\u2019s Official Military Personnel File (OMPF). \nApplicant sent two letters to the commander. After considering Applicant\u2019s response, the \ncommander decided not to recommend filing the letter of reprimand in Applicant\u2019s \nOMPF. The letter would remain in Applicant\u2019s \u201clocal\u201d file until he transferred or was \ndischarged, at which time it would be destroyed.16 \n \n \nOfficer A, Applicant, several other members of the detachment, and at least one \ncivilian were subjects of an investigation conducted by military investigators, state \ninvestigators, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), and the Federal \nBureau of Investigation (FBI). Officer A wrote documents on behalf of his detachment to \nthe Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) to obtain equipment. He also \nwrote letters to firearms dealers wherein he requested and received automatic weapons \nunder the guise that the weapons would be tested and evaluated for use by Special \nForces operatives. Officer A used documents to convince local law enforcement officers \nthat members of his detachment were authorized to carry automatic weapons while \nperforming military training exercises in the area. Officer A worked for a company that \nsupplied weapons to be used in the entertainment industry. Officer A stored the \n                                                          \n14 Tr. at 71-74, 132-134, 186; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE A.1.6, A.1.6.1-A.1.6.4.  \n \n15 GE 5.  \n \n16 Tr. at 52, 74-78, 84-86, 102; GE 5, 7; AE A.1.1, A.1.1.2, B, C.  \n\n \n7 \n \nweapons obtained from the weapons manufacturers in the company\u2019s armory. In turn, \nthe weapons and military property obtained from DRMO were rented to the \nentertainment industry. Officer A forged a signature on one of the detachment member\u2019s \nreenlistment package. He also prepared and forwarded false enlistment packages for \ntwo other individuals.17  \n \n \nOfficer A was interviewed by military investigators and provided a written \nstatement in December 2003. He admitted that he forged a signature on one of the \ndetachment member\u2019s reenlistment package. Nowhere in the statement did Officer A \nadmit or imply that he forged any of the documents that bore Applicant\u2019s signature. He \nindicated that Applicant was advised of the detachment\u2019s training and where and when \nit would take place, but the approval authority was the SUC. He stated that Applicant \nwas aware that the detachment used the company\u2019s armory to obtain and store \nweapons. He stated Applicant was introduced to the owner and toured the armory. \nOfficer A stated that he provided to the armory owner documents that were used to \nprocure weapons for training. He stated that Applicant received copies of the \ndocuments.18  \n \n \nOfficer A was asked how he obtained a CCW permit. He stated that Applicant \nand people at the SUC told him about the possibility of standing up the detachment for \ncourier duties. Officer A moved to a new city in 1996. The local police department told \nhim that he needed a letter from a superior officer in order to obtain a CCW permit. He \nstated that he contacted Applicant and told him that he wanted a CCW permit for his \nwork as a gun handler and for his courier duties. He asked Applicant to write a letter on \nhis behalf, which he did. Officer A stated that he was \u201castonished\u201d when he read the \nletter. He stated that in \u201c[his] opinion the letter [Applicant] prepared was false. It was not \ntruthful as [their] unit was not designated as couriers and the letter was generally \nexaggerated.\u201d He also stated:  \n \n[Applicant] gave me a badge that he said he purchased. He gave it to me \nto use as identifying myself as an MI officer. He gave it to me to use in \nconjunction with my concealed weapons permit to identify myself as an MI \nofficer.19  \n \nApplicant testified that he never had a \u201cshield\u201d type badge such as a law enforcement \nofficer would carry, and that Officer A was describing a standard flat plastic badge like \none that is used as identification in a command or to enter a SCIF (Sensitive \nCompartmented Information Facility).20 \n \n                                                          \n17 Tr. at 26-27, 183 ; GE 3, 4, 8, 10.  \n \n18 GE 3.  \n \n19 Id. \n \n20 Tr. at 155-156.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nIn March 2006, Officer A pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to unlawful \npossession of a machine gun, aiding and abetting (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(o),2(a)); unlawful \nproduction of identification document (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(1)); impersonating a federal \nofficer or employee (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 912); and false statement, causing an act to be done \n(18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001,2(b)). He was placed on probation for three years. Officer A died of \ncancer the following year.21  \n \n \nApplicant testified that Officer A worked for the company that supplied weapons \nto be used in the entertainment industry. He stated that Officer A borrowed the \ncompany\u2019s weapons so that the detachment could do live-fire training. He denied \nknowledge of where the training occurred. He stated there were no government-issued \nweapons kept at the company\u2019s armory. He admitted that he visited the armory on one \noccasion. He also admitted that, at Officer A\u2019s invitation, he visited the chief of police \nwho issued the CCW permit.22    \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant cited to his response to the letter of \nreprimand: \n \nExculpatory evidence exists that frees me from any credible accusation of \nmisleading state and local law enforcement offices. [Officer A] gave a full \nconfession to forging memoranda, and a variety of other documents, and \nspecifically acknowledged my absence of involvement in any wrongdoing. \nHis confession was made to [military investigators] and the US Attorney \nprior to his plea agreement. He specifically exculpated me, a fact which \nshould be contained within the [military] ROI. While you may have \noverlooked that bit of exculpatory evidence, it is unlikely that you failed to \nnotice that [Officer A] was found guilty, pursuant to his guilty plea, of \nWrongful Acquisition of Machine Guns, Counterfeiting, Making False \nWritings, and Conspiracy to Impersonate Authorized U.S. Military \nPersonnel. The counterfeiting and false writings correspond to the \nmemorandum and firearms you attribute, incorrectly, to me.  \n \nI herein state that, with the exception of the two classified information \ncourier documents that were issued as part of my military duties and in my \ncapacity as SSO, and, possibly, one of the memoranda, which is a legal, \nand authorized communication, to the best of my knowledge and belief, \neach and every other document attributed to me is a forgery. Some are \nbetter than others, however, with the exception of the two or three I have \npreviously identified, each of the documents you claim I have written were \nforged \u2013 and these were among the documents that [Officer A] \nacknowledged he forged when he entered into the plea agreement with \nthe United States Attorney. (emphasis in response to SOR) \n \n                                                          \n21 Tr. at 127; GE 13; AE M.  \n \n22 Tr. at 107, 152, 183-184.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant denied signing the two military weapons cards in 1996, as discussed \nabove. He testified that he did not see anything objectionable about the January 1997 \nthank you letter to the chief of police, but he did not recall signing it. He stated that he \nsigned a document similar to the March 1998 \u201cNotice to State and Local Authorities\u201d \nmemorandum, but he did not sign the memorandum in evidence. He testified that he did \nnot remember signing the March 1999 letter requesting assistance in the renewal of \nOfficer A\u2019s CCW permit. He stated the document was inaccurate because he had never \nissued the military cards authorizing members of the detachment to carry weapons in \nconnection with their official duties. He stated that he signed a similar document \nrequesting the initial CCW permit, but he believed the March 1999 letter was a forgery \nbecause he would have more memory of the document if he signed it. He admitted that \nhe signed the May 1999 letter to the weapons manufacturer. Despite Applicant\u2019s \nresponses to the letter of reprimand and the SOR, he testified that Officer A was an \noutstanding officer, and he did not believe that Officer A forged Applicant\u2019s signature to \nthe documents. He testified that he thought it was another officer assigned to the \ndetachment. He stated that Officer A told him that he forged the documents, but \nApplicant found it hard to believe that he would do such a thing.23 \n \n \nAfter considering all the evidence, I find that Applicant signed all the documents \nin evidence containing his signature. I did not find his statements and testimony to the \ncontrary to be credible. I find that the weapons cards were improperly issued for a \nperiod beyond when Officer A was on active duty. I also find that, in the letter to the \nchief of police requesting assistance in the renewal of Officer A\u2019s CCW permit and in the \n\u201cNotice to State and Local Authorities\u201d memorandum, Applicant intentionally \nembellished, and in parts, fabricated the duties of Officer A and other members of the \ndetachment and their requirement to carry concealed weapons for military purposes. I \nfurther find that Applicant\u2019s response to the commander who issued the letter of \nreprimand, his response to the SOR, and his testimony at the hearing were intentionally \nfalse.24 Applicant\u2019s motive for providing the false documents is unclear. There is \ninsufficient evidence for a finding that Applicant was a co-conspirator to all the illegal \nacts committed by officer A. However, I find that Applicant\u2019s actions, at a minimum, \nwere used by Officer A in completing some of his crimes.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted several letters attesting to his outstanding job performance, \nintegrity, professionalism, and trustworthiness. His officer evaluations described him as \nan outstanding officer with a bright future and recommended him for promotion.25 \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n23 Tr. at 57-59, 112-116, 125-131, 181, 184-192; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE A.1.5.  \n \n24 Any false statements that were not specifically alleged in the SOR will not be used for \ndisqualification purposes. They will be used in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, in the application of \nmitigating conditions, and in analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n25 AE A.4.1-A.4.4, A.5.  \n\n \n10 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. \n \n \nApplicant intentionally provided false and misleading information to law \nenforcement officials about the duties and responsibilities of Officer A and other \nmembers of the detachment. AG \u00b6 16(b) is applicable. He improperly issued concealed \nweapons cards to Officer A for a period that extended beyond when Officer A was on \nactive duty. His actions, when considered as a whole, support a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nand unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) is also applicable.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \n\n \n12 \n \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant admitted that he signed the courier orders and the letters to the \nweapons manufacturer. Any concerns generated by those documents have been \nmitigated by the passage of time. As discussed above, he has been intentionally \ndishonest about the other documents. Those documents were all generated more than \n11 years ago. Despite the length of time since they were written, without complete \ncandor, I am unable to find mitigation.26 No Personal Conduct mitigating conditions are \napplicable to the security concerns raised by those documents. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n                                                          \n26 See ISCR Case No. 03-22819 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006). \n\n \n13 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s honorable service in the U.S. military. I also considered \nthe favorable character evidence. Applicant intentionally provided false information up to \nand during his hearing. As a career military officer, he should have known that the most \nimportant character trait is integrity. He failed to display that attribute. I have significant \nunresolved doubts about his honesty, judgment, trustworthiness, and willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated Personal Conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nNovember 25, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application on March 15, 2007.\n(Government Exhibit 1).  On July 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 7, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.   This Administrative Judge was assigned the\nmatter on October 2, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on October 8, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for November 12, 2008.  The Government offered ten exhibits\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 10, which were received without\nobjection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted three exhibits, referred to\nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.)\non November 20, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 34 years old and has a high school diploma and an Associates\nDegree in Electronics Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a\nProduction Engineering Support Technician and is seeking a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because of his questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that can raise\nquestions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\nThe Applicant was on active duty in the United States Army from September\n1992 until January 1995.  He then served in the National Guard from January 1995 until\nFebruary 1997.  \nThe Applicant admitted all of the allegations under this guideline, except\nallegation 1(b), in part.  Applicant started working for his current employer in 1997.  He\nreceived a DoD security clearance in March 1998 and held it until March 2008.  At that\ntime his security clearance was suspended.  \nOn March 13 or 14, 2005, while holding a DoD security clearance, the Applicant\nused methamphetamine that he purchased for $15.00 or $20.00 from a drug dealer on\nthe street.  He used some of it and saved some of it in his vehicle.  The following day,\non March 15, 2005, the Applicant was stopped by the police for having expired car\nlicense tags.  During the search of his car, the police found the Applicant\u2019s\nmethamphetamine under the passenger\u2019s seat.  (Government Exhibit 4).  Applicant was\ncharged with (1) Failure to Appear (on an active bench warrant), (2) Expired Tags, and\n(3) \nPossession \nof \na \nControlled \nDangerous \nSubstance \n(methamphetamine).\n(Government Exhibit 2).  Applicant spent two days in jail.  He pled guilty to the charges\nand was ordered to pay fines/ fees in the amount of $650.00 and was ordered to attend\na Drug Diversion program.  Applicant explained that this involved his attendance and\nparticipation in a twenty week drug awareness course between November 2005 and\nMarch 2006.  (Government Exhibit 3).  Once successfully completed, all charges\nagainst the Applicant would be deemed dismissed.  He was also required to attend\ntwenty Narcotics Anonymous meetings.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  \nApplicant contends that this was the first time he had ever used\nmethamphetamine.  Since he had been working lots of hours and coaching his son\u2019s\nbaseball game he was tired and needed a pick up.  He did not like the effects of the\nmethamphetamine as it made him jittery and paranoid.  (Tr. P. 40).  Applicant states\nthat he did not inform his security department at work about this adverse information\nbecause he was too embarrassed and knew that it could jeopardize his security\nclearance and his job.\n         \nIt was also about this time that the Applicant was in the process of applying for\nspecial security access with another government agency.  During this investigation, the\nApplicant did not disclose his arrest and drug use on his security clearance application\n\n3\nor during his interview with the investigator.  Applicant was ultimately denied this\nclearance in June 2006.  (Tr. pp. 45-46).  Applicant testified that he deliberately failed to\ndisclose the arrest and drug use because he thought that he would automatically lose\nhis job and his security clearance if he admitted it.  (Tr. p. 46).  \nThe Applicant further testified that he has learned a harsh lesson from this\nexperience and regrets what he did.  He almost lost his wife, his family and his house.\nHe made a mistake and will never do it again.  He was embarrassed about his conduct\nand now understands how important it is to maintain a drug free lifestyle and to be\nhonest.  (Government Exhibit 4).  \nLetters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant attest to his\npositive attitude, hard working nature, dedication, trustworthiness, integrity and\nleadership abilities. He is highly recommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16(b) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities;\n16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which,\nwhen considered as a whole supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information;\n16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under ant other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\n\n4\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of:\n16.(d)(3)  pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\n\n5\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in dishonesty and rule violations that demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in poor personal conduct (Guideline E).  The totality of this\nevidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the\nApplicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there\nis a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline E of the SOR.\nThe evidence shows that as recently as March 2005, the Applicant was arrested\nfor Failure to Appear, Expired Tags and Possession of Methamphetamine.\nFurthermore, he purchased and used this dangerous illegal drug while holding a\nsecurity clearance from the Department of Defense.  He deliberately failed to disclose\nthis adverse information to his security department.  During a previous security\ninvestigation by another agency, he deliberately concealed his arrest and drug use and\nwas denied a special access clearance.  This misconduct demonstrates a pattern of\npoor judgment under Guideline E, (Personal Conduct) that is fairly recent and very\ntroubling.  Under the particular facts of this case, the Applicant cannot be considered\nhonest or trustworthy.  \nUnder Guideline E, Disqualifying Conditions 16(b) deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\n\n6\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; 16(c) credible adverse\ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation; 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but\nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is\nnot limited to consideration of . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations apply.\nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Consequently, his poor judgment\nadversely effects his security clearance eligibility at this time.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 34 years old, but has\nconducted himself in a very immature and irresponsible manner.  Under the particular\nfacts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines, viewed\nas a whole, support a whole person assessment of questionable judgement,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.     \nThis Applicant, at this time, has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and\ndoes not meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Government Exhibit 3.) On June 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guidelines K (Security Violations) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 2, 2009, and requested a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 12, 2009. This case was\nassigned to me on November 16, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December\n16, 2009, setting the hearing for January 26, 2010. I convened the hearing as\nscheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified, and submitted Applicant Exhibits A\n\n2\nthrough D, which were also admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing on February 10, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 63 and single. He seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection\nwith his employment in the defense industry. Applicant started work as a Federal\nemployee in 1976. He began work with the Department of Defense in 1984, retiring in\n2003. In January 2006 he began work as a senior manager with a state-run,\nDepartment of Defense funded research institution (Institution). He left that job during\nthe pendency of this case because he did not have a security clearance. (Transcript at\n30-39.) \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. Those admissions are\nhereby deemed findings of fact.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline K, Security Violations)\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e. involve the Applicant\u2019s conduct over a particular\nperiod of time and will be discussed together.\nIn April 2000 Applicant was transferring between jobs within the Defense\nDepartment. As part of his physical move, which involved moving outside the United\nStates, he was going to give a series of briefings in different geographical locations.\nApplicant deliberately and knowingly downloaded classified material from a classified\ncomputer to his unclassified laptop computer. He used that laptop to make\npresentations in unclassified environments. When informed that he had classified\nmaterial on his unclassified laptop, Applicant did nothing to correct the situation.\nClassified information was also downloaded from his unclassified laptop to unmarked\ndisk drives, and left at several commands. All of this violated specific requirements of\nthe DoD Information Security Program (DoD 5200.1-R). (Government Exhibit 6.)\nApplicant describes his conduct this way:\n[B]lessed with a series of good jobs, starting to get arrogant,\nthinking that the world rotates around me. . . . And, like many of my jobs, I\nwas working up until April 19, 2000 on the last day wrapping things up and\nI hadn\u2019t thought ahead about what to do with what I was going to take to\nmy next command. And knowing that I shouldn\u2019t have done it, I packed\naway this - - these classified documents and loaded them onto my\ncomputer, thinking that I would be able to readily use them at the debriefs\nthat I was to conduct on the way. . . . The proper procedure would have\nbeen to mail them ahead under registered and certified mail. I didn\u2019t do\nthat.\n\n3\n.       .       .\nAnd not only was I arrogant enough to not follow the rules, I was\nsloppy in dealing with the classified material I had. I left traces of it around\nwith the different commands I visited. And fortunately nothing was ever\ncompromised, nothing got into the bad guy\u2019s hands, but it was a blatant,\ndeliberate move on my part. I\u2019m not saying the word mistake. It was stupid\nand arrogant. (Transcript at 33-34.) (See Transcript at 42-61; Government\nExhibits 1, 2 and 4.)\nIn addition to the above incident, at some other time before April 2000 Applicant\nhad downloaded other classified information to computer disks. He took these disks with\nhim to his new command, and stored them at his apartment. They were eventually\nrecovered from his apartment in February 2003, after he was interviewed concerning\nthe major incident, discussed above. (Transcript at 61-62.)\nFinally, in 1993 the Applicant had received a classified performance evaluation\nfrom a superior. Applicant kept a copy of this classified document at home with his\npersonal files until its existence was also discovered in about 2003. (Transcript at 63,\n78-79.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in conduct which displays questionable judgment,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\n2.a. The information discussed under Paragraph 1, above, will also be examined\nunder this guideline.\n2.b. Applicant admitted that his security clearance was suspended by another\ngovernmental organization in about 2002. This was due to his conduct as set forth\nunder Paragraph 1, above.\nMitigation\nApplicant was candid, credible and contrite in talking about his security violations\nand the cost to him personally and professionally. When asked what he had learned\nfrom these incidents he said:\nPersonally what I learned was apparently I had gotten in the mode\nwhere these rules didn\u2019t apply to me. That I was working hard and I was\ndoing good stuff I shouldn\u2019t be hindered by these rinky-dink procedural\nrules that just inhibit my performance and stop me from doing things that I\nwant to do and nobody is working as hard as I am and how dare they think\nI should play by the same rules. (Transcript at 63-64.)\n\n4\nHe was then asked, \u201cWhat do you believe now?\u201d Applicant replied, \u201cThat I was\nincredibly arrogant. That I had no business thinking that and there\u2019s good reasons for\nhaving these rules and that I - - I should never have gone down that road.\u201d (Transcript at\n64.)\nWhile working for the Institution Applicant did not have a security clearance.\nHowever, because some of the contracts the Institution administered were classified,\nApplicant thought it in his best interest to get training on security procedures.\nAccordingly, he attended a three day course in International Programs Security\nRequirements, put on by the Defense Institute of Security Assistance Management.\n(Applicant Exhibit D; Transcript at 66-67.)\nApplicant also submitted 23 character reference letters. They are from co-\nworkers at the Institute, senior managers of several defense contractors, and\ngovernment employees. He is described as a \u201creliable and loyal government employee,\u201d\n\u201cthe consummate professional,\u201d and \u201ccompletely trustworthy.\u201d (Applicant Exhibits A and\nB.)\nTwo of the letters are particularly noteworthy. Applicant\u2019s supervisor at the time\nthe security violations were discovered provided a letter on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He\nwrites, \u201c[Applicant] acknowledged his violation and never attempted to minimize its\nsignificance. . . . I would trust [Applicant] with national security information with no\nhesitation. He is a patriotic American and solid citizen who has been punished\nadequately.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A at 25.) \nIn addition, a senior staff member to a United States Senator also wrote on\nApplicant\u2019s behalf. Concerning his work at the Institute she says, \u201cThroughout your\ntenure, there was never a concern about your reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.\u201d\n(Applicant Exhibit C.)  \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\n\n5\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his or her own\ncommon sense, as well as knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline K, Security Violations)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information\nis set out in AG & 33:      \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations\nfor protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about\nan individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and\nability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern.\n(Emphasis supplied.)\n\n6\nThe Applicant engaged in conduct which had potentially serious security\nconsequences. In some cases the information was not found until 2003, three years\nafter the original incident. I find that the following disqualifying conditions apply under\nGuideline K: \n\u00b6 34(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of classified or other protected\ninformation to unauthorized persons, including but not limited to personal\nor business contacts, to the media, or to persons present at seminars,\nmeetings or conferences; \u00b6 34(b) collecting or storing classified or other\nprotected information at home or in any other unauthorized location; \u00b6\n34(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or\notherwise handling classified reports, data, or other information on any\nunapproved equipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word\nprocessor, or computer hardware, software, drive, system, gameboard,\nhandheld, \u201cpalm\u201d or pocket device or other adjunct equipment; and \u00b6 34(g)\nany failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other\nsensitive information.\nThere are two mitigating conditions that apply to the Applicant\u2019s conduct under\nGuideline K. They are: \n\u00b6 35(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened\nso infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \u00b6 35(b) the individual responded\nfavorably to counseling or remedial security training and now\ndemonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security\nresponsibilities.\nConcerning cases such as this, the DOHA Appeal Board has stated, \u201cA person\nwho has committed security violations has a very heavy burden of demonstrating that\nthey should be entrusted with classified information. Because security violations strike\nat the heart of the industrial security program, an Administrative Judge must give any\nclaims of reform and rehabilitation strict scrutiny.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 00-0030 (Appeal\nBoard, September 20, 2001 at 9).) In the same case, the Appeal Board further says that\nthe Government has a compelling interest in protecting classified information from\ndisclosure to unauthorized persons, regardless of whether the disclosure is the result of\ndeliberate or negligent conduct. \nIn this case, Applicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns. His\nsecurity violations occurred ten years ago, albeit some of the information was not\nrecovered until 2003. His frank testimony was self-searching and honest to a\nremarkable degree. He understands his security responsibilities and has compellingly\nshown that he will fulfill them if granted a clearance. (See Transcript at 64-65.) His\ntruthfulness, good judgment, and veracity was attested to by many people, most of\nwhom are involved in the defense industry. Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.\n\n7\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)\nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following Disqualifying Condition is arguably applicable:\n\u00b616(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information.\nI have also examined all of the Applicant\u2019s conduct under this Guideline. The\nfollowing Mitigating Condition applies to his conduct, and supports a finding in\nApplicant\u2019s favor: \n\u00b6 17(d) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAs shown above, Applicant freely admits that his conduct in copying and taking\nclassified information with him from one command to another was \u201carrogant and stupid.\u201d\nHe has always accepted full responsibility for his actions, affirmatively stating without\nprompting that it was not a mistake. Once again, his compelling testimony and evidence\nthat he now has a positive attitude towards his security responsibilities justifies a finding\nin his favor under this paragraph as well.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n8\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I specifically find that the\nApplicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns under the whole-person\nconcept, independently of Guidelines K and E. \nThe admitted conduct involving the mishandling of classified information occurred\nat least ten years ago and has not been repeated. There is considerable evidence of\nrehabilitation under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Under the particular facts of this case, I find that there\nis little to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and\nthat there is no likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his Security\nViolations and Personal Conduct. On balance, I conclude that Applicant has\nsuccessfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a security\nclearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports granting his request for a security\nclearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline K:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He falsified his security clearance application and his first\nsecurity interview about this history. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nand exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), on November 17, 2006. On June 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption), E (Personal Conduct),\nand J (Criminal Conduct).  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\n1\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nNovember 5, 2008\n\nItem 3.\n2\nThe government submitted six items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 4.\n4\nItem 5 at 3; Item 6 at 1.\n5\n2\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 14, 2008, and requested that his\ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.2\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on September 5, 2008. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n3\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his\ncopy of the FORM on September 12, 2008, and returned it to DOHA. He provided no\nfurther response to the FORM within the 30-day period he was given to do so, did not\nrequest additional time to respond, and made no objection to consideration of any\nevidence submitted by Department Counsel. I received the case assignment on October\n23, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 20-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has no military\nservice, and has never held a security clearance. He is single with no children. His\npresent job started in August 2006.4\nIn his answer to the SOR, dated July 14, 2008, Applicant admitted the truth of all\nof the factual allegations in the SOR. He has regularly consumed alcohol since turning\n18 in 2006, even though his state\u2019s minimum legal drinking age is 21. All record\nevidence indicates that he has continued to drink underage, although he told an\ninvestigator in November 2007 that he planned to stop drinking to avoid further trouble.\nOn October 24, 2006, Applicant was stopped by police while driving erratically.\nHe had consumed three beers at a friend\u2019s house before driving, and had an empty\nbeer can in his car. He was charged with, and subsequently convicted of, unlawful\npossession of an alcoholic beverage, a class 1 misdemeanor. On February 15, 2007, he\nwas sentenced to pay a $100 fine, a six month suspension of his driver\u2019s license, and\ntwo years of unsupervised probation.  \n5\nOn November 17, 2006, he signed his e-QIP and certified that his answers were\ntrue, complete and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. Question 23d on that\nform asked if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to\nalcohol or drugs. He answered this question \u201cNo,\u201d and admitted in his answer to the\nSOR that he deliberately failed to list the October 24, 2006 criminal charge noted above.\n\nItem 5 at 3; Item 6 at 2.\n6\nItem 5 at 4.\n7\nItem 5 at 5; Item 6 at 3.\n8\n3\nDuring an October 1, 2007, interview with an Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) investigator, Applicant attributed his failure to list his October 2006 criminal\ncharge as an oversight. During that interview, he also admitted that he had been\ncharged with a second underage possession of alcohol offense on April 24, 2007. He\nwas charged in May 2007 and convicted in June of that year. He was sentenced to six\nmonths confinement, all suspended, another six month suspension of his driver\u2019s\nlicense, 20 hours of community service, and a $500 fine.  He also affirmatively told the\n6\ninvestigator that he had not had any other criminal charges related to alcohol.   \n7\nApplicant, in fact, had been charged with underage possession of alcohol again\non September 26, 2007. This charge arose when the car in which he was riding with his\nfriend was stopped for running a red light, and the police discovered three beers in the\ncar. When interviewed again about this incident on November 7, 2007, he offered no\nreason for his failure to disclose this charge during the earlier interview. After several\ncontinuances, this charge was dismissed on January 4, 2008.  \n8\nTitle 18 \u00a7 1001 of the United States Code provides, in pertinent part: \nStatements or entries generally \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter\nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knowingly and willfully--\n  (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a\nmaterial fact;\n  (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or\nrepresentation; or\n  (3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to\ncontain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry;\nshall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or, if the\noffense involves international or domestic terrorism (as defined in section\n2331), imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both.\nApplicant offered no explanation, rebuttal, or extenuating evidence in response to\nthe SOR or the FORM. Since he elected a determination on the written record, no in-\nperson evaluation of his character or credibility was possible.\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d AG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying. The disqualifying condition asserted by the Government in\nthis case is: \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\u201d\nApplicant admitted to possessing and consuming alcohol in violation of his state\u2019s\nminimum drinking age laws on a regular basis. He was charged with this offense three\ntimes, and convicted of it twice, within less than a year. The Government has\nestablished security concerns under this guideline, shifting the burden of proof to\nApplicant to mitigate those concerns.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\n\n6\nApplicant neither asserted nor provided any evidence to support application of\nany of these potentially mitigating conditions. Since the record evidence does not raise\nany of them, alcohol consumption security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s pattern of\nalcohol-related arrests and ongoing disregard for legal restrictions on his alcohol\nconsumption continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good\njudgment.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The disqualifying conditions alleged in the SOR and raised by the\nevidence in this case are:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other government representative.\nApplicant deliberately omitted responsive information about his October 2006\nunlawful possession of alcohol charge in response to question 23 on his November\n2006 e-QIP. He certified the completeness and accuracy of his answers, acknowledging\nthe obligation to be truthful. He did admit to this charge, as well as the second charge\nfrom April 2007, to the OPM investigator when confronted about them on October 1,\n2007.  However, he stated during that interview that he had not had any other criminal\ncharges related to alcohol despite having again been stopped and charged with\nunderage possession of alcohol only five days previously. The weight of evidence in this\nrecord and Applicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR establish that his\nfalsifications and omissions of relevant information concerning these criminal charges\non his e-QIP and during that interview were deliberate. \nApplicant did not establish mitigation by his subsequent admissions to the OPM\ninvestigator because AG \u00b6 17(a) requires that, \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith\n\n7\nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with\nthe facts.\u201d He offered no plausible explanation for these falsifications, and in fact\nadmitted that they were deliberate. He neither asserted nor established any other\npersonal conduct mitigating condition with respect to these security concerns.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying. The disqualifying condition asserted by the Government is,\n\u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d Although Applicant\u2019s alcohol-\nrelated offenses and admitted underage drinking on a regular basis are mentioned by\nDepartment Counsel and would support application of several disqualifying conditions,\nonly his falsifications of his e-QIP and during his October 1, 2007, OPM interview were\nalleged in \u00b6 3a of the SOR. Those falsifications are felonies under Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1001. His conduct on those occasions supports significant concerns about his\njudgment, reliability and willingness to comply with laws and rules. These admitted\noffenses, individually and collectively, raise security concerns under the aforementioned\ndisqualifying condition.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security\nconcerns. Applicant neither asserted nor established any of the potentially mitigating\nconditions listed therein. His demonstrated willingness to engage in a pattern of illegal\nconduct precludes their application.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n\n8\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young and relatively\nimmature individual who is nevertheless responsible for his choices and conduct. He\nknowingly participated in all of the conduct alleged against him, which was both frequent\nand recent. He submitted no evidence of rehabilitation or permanent behavioral change,\nor demonstrating that risk of coercion or duress is not significant. His ongoing disregard\nof lawful obligations, especially after receiving notice of the security concerns raised\nthereby, creates continuing doubt about his trustworthiness and reliability. He offered no\nother evidence about his character or responsibility to mitigate these concerns, or\ntending to make their continuation less likely. Overall, the record evidence creates\nsubstantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from his alcohol consumption, personal conduct, and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHISTORY OF CASE\nOn May 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to\ndetermine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 2, 2008, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on June 16, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on July 16,\n2008.  A hearing was held on July 16, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether it\nwould be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of two\nexhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.)\nSeptember 12, 2008\n\n2\nwas received on July 23, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is granted.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to consider retention of\nhis Swedish passport and document its surrender should he make the decision to do so.\nFor good cause shown, Applicant was granted 10 days, to July 28, 2008 to supplement\nthe record. The Government was afforded two days to respond.  Within the time\npermitted, Applicant supplemented the record with a faxed cover sheet, letter confirming\nhis decision to surrender his Swedish passport and documented surrender of his\npassport to his employer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO).  Department counsel did not\nobject to these post-hearing submissions. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibits were\nadmitted and considered as exhibits A and B.  \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline C, Applicant is alleged to (a) be a dual citizen of the U.S. and\nSweden, (b) possess a valid Swedish passport that does not expire till December 12,\n2012, \u00a9) have used his Swedish passport on trips to European countries in July 1985,\nMay 1998, April 2001, November 2002, and March 2008, (d) have indicated an\nunwillingness to surrender, destroy, or invalidate his Swedish passport, (e) have\nindicated he used his Swedish passport to protect his financial or business interests, (f)\nhave resided in and were employed in Sweden from December 1999 to April 2001, and\n(g) has a pension account from the government of Sweden that will remain in effect until\nhe retires.\nFor his answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR with\nexplanations. He claimed he became a Swedish citizen as a minor, and his Swedish\ncitizenship is based solely on a parent\u2019s citizenship. \nIn his answer, Applicant claimed his visits to European countries were mostly\nfamily-oriented, with the only exception being the academic research work he pursued at\na Swedish technical university in the field of noise and vibration control for civil\ntransportation he pursued.  He claimed his Swedish pension account was created for\nhim when he studied at a Swedish technical university and was very small. It is an\naccount he would be happy to close, assuming that it is possible to do so.  Applicant\u2019s\nresearch did not encounter any conflicts with the security interests of the U.S.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 35-year-old engineering specialist for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth (see ex. 1; R.T. ,at 21).  He is unmarried and\nhas no children (R.T., at 29).  He holds undergraduate and graduates in the sciences\nfrom recognized American universities. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members are U.S. citizens.  He became a\nSwedish citizen as a minor through his mother\u2019s Swedish citizenship (R.T., at 21-22, 27).\nHe never took an oath of allegiance to Sweden and has no plans to do so (R.T., at 33).\nHis mother arranged for his Swedish citizenship, and Applicant had nothing to do with\nthe application process.  \nApplicant possessed a valid Swedish passport for Swedish identity and family\nheritage reasons (R.T., at 22), and last used it in March 2008 (R.T., at 42).  The passport\nis due to expire in December 2012 (R.T., at 39). He has held three passports, and\nobtained his current passport in December 2007 by filing a renewal application (R.T., at\n40-41).   He has traveled to European Union (EU) countries using his Swedish passport\nmostly for family and cultural reasons (R.T., at 22, 43-44).  He never used his Swedish\npassport to protect his financial interests, but expressed plans to retain the passport (see\nex. 2; R.T., at 23-24).  He repeated his reluctance to surrender or destroy his Swedish\npassport, but requested time to reconsider his decision (see ex. 2; R.T., at 49-52).  If\nafforded an option to surrender his Swedish passport at this time, he indicated he would\nstrongly consider it (R.T., at 52-54).  Following the hearing, he documented his surrender\nof his Swedish passport to his employer\u2019s FSO (see ex. D).\nApplicant worked and lived in Sweden between December 1998 and April 2001\n(compare ex. 1 with R.T., at 23-25, 35-36, 61), while conducting scientific research at a\nSwedish technical university in the field of noise and vibration control for civil\ntransportation. His academic work included taking and teaching classes (R.T., at 38).\nApplicant has no desire to take up permanent residence  in Sweden.  \nApplicant has a Swedish pension account worth about $160.00 (R.T., at 25-26,\n61-62).  This account was created for him by the Swedish university he worked for while\nenrolled at the university.   This account is particularly small when compared to his U.S.\nportfolio, which includes his home valued at $255,000.00 and his equity in the home,\nvalued at around $75,000.00 (R.T., at 60).  He has no special interest in retaining the\naccount, and he could probably close it. \nApplicant has no business or financial interest in Sweden besides the pension\naccount and has no plans to invest in the country.  He has never voted in a Swedish\nelection or served in the Swedish military.  He has no debts or obligations to Sweden or\nany foreign country.  And he has accepted no educational, medical, or other benefits\nfrom Sweden that required his use of his Swedish citizenship, save for his small pension\n(R.T., at 63-64).  He acknowledged only his small pension and his being treated by a\nSwedish doctor for a sore throat (R.T., at 64).\n\n4\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by administrative\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the\nadministrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or\ndenied.  The Guidelines do not require the administrative judge to assess these factors\nexclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines,\nadministrative judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the\nDirective, which are intended to assist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy\nfactors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Preference\nThe Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may\nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the\ninterests of the United States.  See Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 9.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to\ndo so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the\nrecord, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends,\nin large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversary\nproceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical\nbasis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that\nare grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s]\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a\nmaterial bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The\nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to\naffirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified\ninformation before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take\naccount of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nsafeguard classified information.\n\n5\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing\nhis or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nAnalysis \nApplicant presents as a U.S. citizen by birth who became a naturalized citizen of\nSweden through his mother, who had Swedish citizenship by birth.  Aside from possessing a\nSwedish passport and using it on several occasions to enter and exit Sweden principally for\nfamily reasons, Applicant has never exercised any active indicia of dual citizenship with\nSweden. Claiming his principal affections lie with the U.S., he, nonetheless, retained his\nSwedish passport and a small Swedish pension account at the time of hearing. \nDual citizenship concerns necessarily entail allegiance assessments and invite critical\nconsiderations over acts indicating a preference or not for the interests of the foreign country\nover the interests of the U.S.  The issues, as such, raise concerns over Applicant\u2019s\npreference for a foreign country over the U.S.\nBy virtue of his naturalized citizenship in Sweden to his mother of Swedish birth and\ncitizenship, Applicant was endowed with Swedish citizenship, which could be renounced by\nhis expressed intention or actions.  This, Applicant  has never done, out of respect for his\nmother.  Since becoming a naturalized Swedish citizen as a young boy, Applicant has taken\nno actions and exercised no Swedish privileges that can be fairly characterized as active\nindicia of dual citizenship, save for (a) his limited use of his  Swedish passport when traveling\nto European countries and (b) his possession of a small pension account.  He has not voted\nin Swedish elections or served in the Swedish military.  He holds only a small pension account\nin Sweden of $160.00, which is quite minimal when compared to his U.S. asset portfolio, and\nhas accepted no preferential educational, medical or other benefits from Sweden since\nbecoming a naturalized Swedish citizen.  Nor has he ever performed or attempted to perform\nduties, or otherwise acted so as to serve the interests of Sweden in preference to the interests\nof the U.S. since becoming a Swedish citizen.\nBecause Applicant possessed and used his Swedish passport and retains a small\nearned pension right in Sweden as the result of his brief work for a Swedish technical\nuniversity between 1999 and 2001, the Government may apply disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6\n10(a) of AG \u00b6 9, \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligations of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes\nbut is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other  \n \nsuch benefits from a foreign country; \n\n6\n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \n          another country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country;\n(7) voting in a foreign election.\u201d  \n However, Applicant\u2019s residence time in Sweden was very brief (1999-2001) and was\nlimited to his time spend in academic pursuits at a Swedish technical university.  He claims no\nintention to make Sweden his permanent residence.  He never voted in a Swedish election\nand never served in the Swedish military.  He has never sought to hold political office in\nSweden or used his Swedish citizenship to protect his financial or business interests.  \nFurthermore, Applicant\u2019s financial interest in his Swedish pension account is still quite\nminimal (around $160.00) when compared with her U.S. based portfolio and overall net worth\n(in excess of $75,000.00)  As a result of this agreement\u2019s neutralizing of any country\nadvantage in collecting old age pension benefits derived from either country, Applicant\u2019s\nSwedish old age pension rights became security insignificant and were properly deleted by\nDepartment Counsel as a source of security concern at the close of the hearing.  \nBy relinquishing his Swedish passport, Applicant has complied with the mitigation\nrequirements of MC \u00b6 11 (e), \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated,\u201d of AG \u00b6 18.  And while his surrendering his\nSwedish passport to his FSO does not automatically mitigate any past use of the passport to\nenter and exit European countries, his recited limited use of the passport is insufficient by\nitself to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s preference for Sweden over the U.S.\nFailure to satisfy a mitigating condition may be taken into account when assessing an\napplicant\u2019s overall claim of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, but may not be\nturned into a disqualifying condition.  See ISCR Case No. 01-02270 (Appeal Bd. Aug. 29,\n2003).  That Applicant may wish to keep his Swedish citizenship out of respect for his mother\nis not sufficient reason either to preclude him from mitigating security concerns over his\nholding dual citizenship and a small Swedish pension, if those rights do not entail his exacting\npreferential retirement privileges from Sweden.  \nWhole person precepts favor Applicant\u2019s preference for the U.S. over Sweden.  He is a\nU.S. citizen by birth and has always demonstrated his loyalty for the U.S.  His principal\nfinancial interests are situated in the U.S.  And his time spent in Sweden was relatively brief\nand devoted to his educational pursuits.  \nOverall, Applicant persuades that his preference is with the U.S.  He satisfies his proof\nburden in several ways: demonstrated lack of any prior exercise of any privileges associated\nwith his Swedish citizenship, save for his limited use of his Swedish passport and maintaining\na small bank account in Sweden. Applicant absolves himself of foreign preference concerns\n\n7\nand carries his evidentiary burden on the presented issue of whether his preference lies with\nhis native country (U.S.) or the country (Sweden) where he was naturalized as a minor\nthrough his mother\u2019s Swedish citizenship.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.g of Guideline C.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of\nthe factors and conditions enumerated in E2.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of\nthe Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate formal\nfindings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE C (FOREIGN PREFERENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nFOR APPLICANT\n CONCLUSIONS\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

Clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on January 16, 2007. On October 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), and G (Alcohol Consumption). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 27, 2008. Applicant \nanswered the SOR in writing on November 11, 2008, and elected to have his case \ndecided at a hearing. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 10, \nJuly 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009. On February 11, 2009, the case was assigned to me. On March 12, 2009, DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for April 9, 2009. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 20, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through J, which \nwere received without objection, and he testified on his behalf. I held the record open \nuntil April 17, 2009 to afford the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional material. \nApplicant timely submitted AE K and L, which were received without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 17, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations alleged. After \na thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old network engineer, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since October 2008. GE 1, Tr. 27, 33. Except for brief periods, he \nhas continuously held a security clearance since April 1982 that was initially granted to \nhim when he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, discussed infra. Tr. 30, 37-38. He seeks to \nretain his clearance which is required as a condition of his employment. Tr. 39.  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1979. Tr. 35. Following high school, \nhe completed vocational school in October 1980 where he studied technical illustration. \nTr. 35-36. He served in the Air Force from April 1982 to September 1988, and was \nhonorably discharged as a staff sergeant (pay grade E-5). Tr. 30, AE F. Applicant has \ntaken a number of college courses over the years and estimates he has accumulated \n68 credit hours. Tr. 36-37. \n \nApplicant was married to his first wife from October 1980 to July 1984. That \nmarriage ended by divorce. He has been married to his second wife since November \n1986. He has a 21-year-old son from his second marriage, who is independent and lives \non his own. GE 1, Tr. 27-29. \n \nApplicant has a history of episodic alcohol abuse, marked by an extensive history \nof 13 alcohol-related arrests spanning a 13-year period from August 1992 to January \n2005. This hearing was Applicant\u2019s second DOHA hearing in which alcohol formed the \nbasis of security concerns.  \n \nHis previous hearing was held on September 22, 1994, and eight alcohol-related \nconcerns were substantiated. They are: (a) he was found to have consumed alcohol, at \ntimes to excess and to the point of intoxication and blackout, from approximately 1976 \nto at least June 1993; (b) he was arrested in August 1992 and charged with assault \n(domestic violence), having consumed alcohol before his arrest. He was convicted and \nfined approximately $283.00; (c) he was arrested in October 1992 and charged with \ndriving under the influence of alcohol and driving with a blood alcohol content level over \n\n \n3 \n \n \n.10 percent. He was convicted and fined approximately $559.00 and ordered to attend \nalcohol counseling; (d) he was arrested in February 1993 and charged with domestic \nviolence and criminal damage, having consumed alcohol before his arrest. He was \nconvicted and fined approximately $480.00; (e) he was arrested in May 1993 and \ncharged with disorderly conduct and unreasonable noise, having consumed alcohol \nbefore his arrest. He was convicted and fined approximately $100.00; (f) he was \narrested in June 1993 and charged with disorderly conduct, fighting, and violent or \nseriously disruptive behavior, having consumed alcohol before his arrest. He was \nconvicted and imposition of sentence was withheld on the condition he obtained \ntreatment; (g) he received counseling at an alcohol treatment center from approximately \nJune 1993 to July 1993 for a condition diagnosed as alcoholic; and (h) he received \ninpatient treatment from July 1993 to August 1993 for a condition diagnosed, in part, as \nalcohol dependency.  \n \nHe stated at his September 1994 hearing, \u201cI\u2019ve had fourteen months of sobriety \nsince that treatment, longer than the period of time that it took to get arrested five times. \nI\u2019m never going to touch alcohol again and that\u2019s it.\u201d GE 13, p. 62. Following his hearing, \nthe Administrative Judge granted Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nThe October 2008 SOR restated the five arrests above; however, with the \nexception of the October 1992 arrest for driving under the influence, the remaining four \nalcohol-related convictions had been vacated pursuant to state law. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.e.) \n \nSince Applicant\u2019s previous 1994 DOHA hearing, he was arrested eight more \ntimes for alcohol-related incidents. Summarized, they are: (1) he was arrested in 1996 \nfor driving under the influence. He was convicted and fined, sentenced to 10 days in jail \nwith 9 days suspended, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for 90 days, and he was \nordered to participate in an alcohol screening program; (2) he was arrested in July 1996 \nfor domestic violence and disorderly conduct; (3) he was arrested in August 1996 for \ndomestic violence and assault. The charges were dismissed; (4) he was arrested in \nNovember 2001 for driving under the influence. He was sentenced to a fine and \nincarceration; (5) he was arrested in June 2003 for driving under the influence. He was \nconvicted of extreme DUI \u2013 BAC of .15 percent or more. He was sentenced to a fine \nand served 10 days in jail; (6) he was arrested in May 2004 for driving under the \ninfluence. He was convicted and fined, sentenced to 10 nights in jail, and attended an \nalcohol counseling program; (7) he was arrested in January 2005 for criminal \ndamage/deface. The charges were amended to disorderly conduct. He was convicted, \nfined, ordered to attend alcohol awareness class, and placed on one year of probation; \n(8) he was arrested in April 2005 for driving under the influence. He was convicted, \nfined, sentenced to 10 nights in jail, attended alcohol awareness class, and placed on \none year of probation. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. \u2013 1.m.)  \n \nThe evidence also established that Applicant consumed alcohol since high \nschool, at times to excess, until at least July 2005; that he had consumed alcohol before \nall of his arrests to include those arrests adjudicated at his first DOHA hearing; that his \ndrinking had affected his work performance; that he had been diagnosed as alcohol \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndependent by medical professionals; and that following his 1993 alcohol treatment, he \nrelapsed and consumed alcohol to excess in 1996 and from 2001 to 2005. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. \n\u2013 2.h.) Response to SOR, GE 1-20. \n \nIn seeking to retain his clearance, Applicant stated, \u201cI have found the Holy Grail \nto prevention of alcohol consumption, in my case, and am sharing that in community \nactivities in order to provide the possibility to others.\u201d Response to SOR. \n \nApplicant testified he has stopped drinking since July 1, 2005. Tr. 44, 120, 125, \nAE A. He described that day as the day his counselor saw him drinking in a local \nrestaurant and gave him a \u201clook\u201d and it was at that point he \u201chad to make a decision.\u201d \nTr. 110. Applicant testified he has not had anything with alcohol in it since that day with \nthe possible exception of Nyquil, adding that it was a struggle for him whether or not to \ntake Nyquil because it had alcohol in it. He admitted to taking the Nyquil sometime last \nyear. Tr. 111, 131-133. After July 2005, he attended AA meetings on a regular basis, \nbut described his current AA attendance as \u201cnot very often anymore.\u201d 105-106. He \nadded that he maintains a lifestyle that does not include or involve alcohol. Tr. 117-119, \n123-124.  \n \nApplicant submitted a DUI \u2013 Related Substance Abuse Evaluation from his \nlicensed independent substance abuse counselor dated September 16, 2008, who \ndescribed his prognosis as \u201cgood.\u201d AE A. He last saw his counselor in an office setting \nin \u201cJuly or August 2008.\u201d Tr. 122, 126. He does not attend AA meetings anymore and \nbelieves his current course of conduct is sufficient to stop drinking. Tr. 126-128. The last \ntime he attended an AA meeting was in January 2009. Tr. 134. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t trust \nAA. I don\u2019t trust them. I don\u2019t trust the people and stuff because I just don\u2019t, you know, I \nunderstand the program, I understand getting with God and all of this stuff.\u201d Tr. 135. \n \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted an undated letter from his counselor, who is \nthe same counselor who prepared the September 16, 2008 evaluation. She stated in \npart: \n \n[Applicant]\u2019s history is one of episodic abuse with 4 year intervals of \nsobriety. He began outpatient therapy including individual sessions with \nthis therapist after the screening. [Applicant] also completed 16 hours of \nalcohol education, 18 hours of defensive driving instruction and listened to \nthe experience of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD). \n \n[Applicant\u2019s] last drink was on July 1, 2005. He remained in outpatient \ngroup therapy on his own volition as a self-pay client. He attended AA \nregularly and has a sponsor, [name of sponsor]. \n \n[Applicant] has walked the extra mile in acknowledging his alcohol abuse \nby speaking about his experiences for the DUI Task Force of [name of \nstate], as well as engaging in other community service. His continuous \nsobriety is undeniable and his rescreening on 09-16-08 indicated no \n\n \n5 \n \n \nproblems at work, in his marriage and family or medically. The client\u2019s \nlifestyle has completely changed since 2005. \n \nNo one, to [Applicant\u2019s] knowledge, drank in his family for several \ngenerations. However, obviously the genetic abnormality existed although \nit was never manifested. He has Native American heritage and research \nhas correlated that ethnicity with predisposition for alcoholism. He \nunderstands that he is alcohol intolerant by heredity.  \n \nThere is a plethora of evidence that [Applicant] has acknowledged his \nproblem and been proactive in his continuous abstinence from alcohol. His \nwork has not been impaired ever. He received a commendation as \n\u201cemployee of the month\u201d at his workplace, as well as having a record of \nexcellent work performance evaluations. His marital relationship has \nimproved and his 12 step program has generated heightened spirituality.  \n \n[Applicant], in the past, used alcohol as a coping mechanism for stress. \nHis negative consequences from alcohol have provided insight into the \nprogressive, chronic, even terminal nature of this disease. \n \nThere are to my knowledge no mitigating circumstances in [Applicant\u2019s] \nlife that would raise a security concern. \n \nI have [been] a licensed behavioral health and addiction therapist for 25 \nyears. [Name of community] is a small community with few places to hide. \nIn my network of contacts, if [Applicant] were to relapse I would soon \nknow. \n \nI highly endorse [Applicant] as a reliable person with strong morals and \nvalues. He has a flawless work ethic and is open and honest about his \npast mistakes. I know he is 100% trustworthy. AE L \n \nApplicant submitted four work-related reference letters. All of the authors of the \nreference letters were positive in their assessment of Applicant and view him as \ntrustworthy and reliable. AE B \u2013 E. He submitted a certificate reflecting that he was \nqualified to participate as a [state] site steward, that he was employee of the month for \nMarch 2001, and that he was awarded two company awards in May 2005 and June \n2006. AE G \u2013 J.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning criminal conduct \nstating, \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nTwo criminal conduct disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) provide:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(b) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nThe Government established these two disqualifying conditions through \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides for potentially applicable criminal conduct mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6 32 does not provide a \u201cbright line\u201d rule for determining when a crime is \n\u201crecent.\u201d1 If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any \nevidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that \nperiod of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a \nfinding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d2 Applicant\u2019s 13 alcohol-related arrests from August \n1992 to April 2005 show a documented inability or unwillingness over time to comply \nwith the law. Particularly troubling are his repeated decisions to get behind the wheel \nwhile under the influence on at least five occasions endangering himself and others, the \nmost recent occurring in April 2005. Applicant\u2019s repetitive behavior precludes application \nof AG \u00b6 31(a). \n \nApplicant is able to receive partial credit under AG \u00b6 32(d) because of his good \nemployment record, remorse, and constructive community involvement. However, the \npassage of time does not overcome the recurrent alcohol-related criminal behavior that \nApplicant engaged in for 13 years nor has he sufficiently demonstrated successful \n \n1See generally, e.g. ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (Although the \npassage of three years since Applicant\u2019s last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel the Judge \nto apply CC MC 1, as a matter of law, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why he did not \napply that mitigating condition.). \n  \n2 Id.  \n  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nrehabilitation precluding full application of this mitigating condition. See discussion \nsupra under AG \u00b6 32(a). \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n \n \nFive alcohol consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case. Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), 22(c), 22(d) and 22(f) \nprovide: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless, of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; and \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program. \n \nApplicant\u2019s 13 alcohol-related arrests from 1992 to 2005, admitted periodic \nexcessive drinking from high school to at least July 2005, admission that alcohol \naffected his work performance, diagnosis as alcohol dependent by medical \nprofessionals, and alcohol relapses by drinking to excess in 1996 and from 2001 to \n2005 warrant application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), 22(c), 22(d), and 22(f). The Government \nproduced substantial evidence supporting these five disqualifying conditions, and the \nburden shifted to Applicant as it did under criminal conduct, supra, to produce evidence \nand prove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never \nshifts to the Government.3 \n \n3See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nTwo alcohol consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not define the sufficiency of the passage of time, and there is no \n\u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d conduct. Based on my evaluation of \nthe record evidence as a whole,4 for reasons discussed supra, and Applicant\u2019s having \nbeen granted a clearance following a DOHA hearing in September 1994 and his return \nto drinking with assurances he would not do so, I am unable to apply AG \u00b6 20(a). AG \u00b6 \n20(b) does not fully apply because Applicant had a relapse and furthermore did not \nprovide sufficient corroborating evidence suggesting he has overcome his problem. \nWhile the evidence from his counselor was helpful, his statement that he has not had a \ndrink since July 2005 is insufficient to overcome his history of alcohol abuse and \nalcohol-related problems. I am still left with doubts regarding his commitment to abstain \nfrom alcohol and that his alcohol consumption problems are \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d5   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n4See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at \n4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). \n   \n5These two mitigating conditions are discussed further in the whole person analysis portion of this \ndecision, infra. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nApplicant has stated that he has not consumed alcohol since July 2005 and \nclaims he has found the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d to avoid further alcohol consumption. He submitted \nstatements of positive work-related references, and evidence of community involvement \nas a state site steward. He honorably served in the Air Force over six years and has \nworked in the defense industry since his release from active duty in 1988. \n \nHowever, given Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of alcohol abuse and the related \nproblems that alcohol consumption has caused him and others leaves me with doubt \nregarding his eligibility to hold a security clearance. Particularly troubling is his prior \nhistory of having gone through this hearing process in 1994 and serious relapses. \nAssurances from his counselor, while helpful, are insufficient to overcome his history. \nApplicant stated he does not believe in AA and does not attend AA meetings. His last \nappointment with his counselor was in July or August 2008. While he is free to reject \nAA, he does not offer an alternative support system. Given his history, more is required \nthan his assurances that he will not drink.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption and criminal conduct. The evidence \nleaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.   \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns raised. Applicant has not met his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. I take this position based on the \nlaw, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful \nconsideration of the whole person factors\u201d6 and supporting evidence, my application of \nthe pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my \nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not \neligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 51 years old and single. He has a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geophysics and Math, is employed by a defense contractor as a Software Engineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process. The Applicant denied each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline, except 1(e). (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR.) From 1994 through 1995, the Applicant took care of his mother who was suffering from liver cancer. This difficult experience caused emotional turmoil for the Applicant and his family. At this time, his mother-in-law was suffering from pancreatic cancer. His mother passed away in December 1994, and a couple of days later his mother-in-law died. Applicant\u2019s emotional state was adversely effected by his mother\u2019s illness and death. (Tr. p. 102.) In 2004, the Applicant applied for a security clearance. By an adjudicative agency decision dated April 30, 2004, the Applicant\u2019s SCI access was revoked, due to his illegal drug use and his failure to report his foreign national contacts.

(Government Exhibit 1.)  On June 30, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guideline E for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry\u201d (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \u201cDefense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program\u201d (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on August 29, 2010, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on October 14, 2010.  A notice of hearing was issued on October 19, 2010,\nand the hearing was scheduled for November 19, 2010.  At the hearing the Government\npresented four exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4.  The Applicant\ncalled six witness and presented four exhibits at the hearing, referred to as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through D.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.)\n\n2\nwas received on November 30, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 51 years old and single.  He has a Bachelor of Science Degree\nin Geophysics and Math, is employed by a defense contractor as a Software Engineer,\nand is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.  \nThe Applicant denied each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline, except 1(e).  (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR.)  \nFrom 1994 through 1995, the Applicant took care of his mother who was\nsuffering from liver cancer.  This difficult experience caused emotional turmoil for the\nApplicant and his family.  At this time, his mother-in-law was suffering from pancreatic\ncancer. His mother passed away in December 1994, and a couple of days later his\nmother-in-law died.  Applicant\u2019s emotional state was adversely effected by his mother\u2019s\nillness and death.  (Tr. p. 102.)\nIn 2004, the Applicant applied for a security clearance.  By an adjudicative\nagency decision dated April 30, 2004, the Applicant\u2019s SCI access was revoked, due to\nhis illegal drug use and his failure to report his foreign national contacts.  The basis of\nthe revocation was that the Applicant used marijuana at least fifty times, and that he\nused cocaine at least fifty times between 1985 and 1986.  (Government Exhibit 2.)   \nThe Applicant stated that at no time during the prior investigation did he tell the\nagent or investigator that he used marijuana fifty times or that he used cocaine fifty\ntimes.  (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR and Government 2.)  In fact, he states that he\nreported that he tried marijuana on two occasions in December 1999 or 2000, for a total\nof five puffs.  (Tr. pp. 130-131.)  He also reported that he used cocaine in the mid 80's,\nno more than five times.  (Tr. pp. 133-135.)  Applicant states that he answered all\nquestions fully, candidly and honesty.  (Tr. p. 139 and Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.)  He\nadmits that he used marijuana after having been granted a security clearance in August\n2000.  (Tr. p. 131.)  At the time, he was hanging around friends who were partiers.  (Tr.\np. 131.)  Since 2000, he has redirected his life, no longer associates with drug users\nand has not used any illegal drugs.  Applicant submitted the results of a urine analysis\ndated August 10, 2009, that is negative for cocaine, methamphetamine, THC, opiates\nand Benzodiazepines.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  He admits that he exercised poor\njudgment when he experimented with drugs.  He regrets his mistakes of the past and\nstates that he has no intentions of ever using any illegal drug again.  (Tr. p. 139.) \n\n3\nThe Applicant testified that he did not appeal the decision by the other agency\nthat was based upon false information because he did not read the decision well, he\nwas stressed out, felt alone, and he did not need the SCI access at the time.  (Tr. p.\n137.)  He did not look back on the process until 2006, when he was re-investigated for\nhis Top Secret security clearance.  In October 2006, a memorandum from the Defense\nSecurity Service indicated that his security clearance suspension was warranted.\n(Government Exhibit 4.)  In retrospect, he realizes that he should have appealed the\ndecision regardless of the amount of pain he would have to endure.  (Tr. p. 138.)  \nAllegation 1(f)  In his response to an interrogatory issued by the Department of\nDefense (DoD) dated February 5, 2009, the Government alleged that the Applicant\nfalsified material facts in that he stated that he used marijuana either in 1999 or 2000\nand that he had not tried marijuana since that time, when in fact he used marijuana to at\nleast September 2003.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  No evidence was presented to me\ncontaining any supporting documentation from the interviews where the Applicant was\nalleged to have made these statements. Factual conclusions of third parties about what\nthe Applicant allegedly told them, without supporting documentation, is insufficient to\nprove that the information is accurate or correct.  As an independent trier of fact, I am\nnot bound by their findings, which I have no way of knowing are correct.  Based upon\nthe evidence presented, this allegation is found for the Applicant.  \nAllegation 1(g)  In his response to an interrogatory issued by the Department of\nDefense (DoD) dated July 10, 2008, the Government alleged that the Applicant falsified\nmaterial facts in that he stated that he last tried marijuana around 2000, when in fact he\nused marijuana to at least September 2003.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  No evidence was\npresented to me containing any supporting documentation from the interviews where\nthe Applicant was alleged to have made these statements.  Again, factual conclusions\nof third parties about what the Applicant allegedly told them, without supporting\ndocumentation, is insufficient to prove that the information is accurate or correct.  As an\nindependent trier of fact, I am not bound by their findings, which I have no way of\nknowing are correct.  Based upon the evidence presented, this allegation is found for\nthe Applicant.  \nAllegation 1(h)  In his response to an interrogatory issued by the Department of\nDefense (DoD) dated July 10, 2008, the Government alleges that the Applicant falsified\nmaterial facts in that he stated that he experimented with cocaine on a couple of\noccasion around 1985, when in fact he used cocaine at least fifty times from 1985 to\n1986.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  No evidence was presented to me containing any\nsupporting documentation from the interviews where the Applicant was alleged to have\nmade these statements. Factual conclusions of third parties about what the Applicant\nallegedly told them, without supporting documentation, is insufficient to prove that the\ninformation is accurate or correct.  As an independent trier of fact, I am not bound by\ntheir findings, which I have no way of knowing are correct.  Based upon the evidence\npresented, this allegation is found for the Applicant.  \nAllegation 1(i) In his response to an interrogatory issued by the Department of\nDefense (DoD) dated July 10, 2008, the Government alleged that the Applicant falsified\n\n4\nmaterial facts in that he stated that he did not contribute money to the purchase of\nillegal drugs, when in fact he did contribute money to the purchase of illegal drugs.\n(Government Exhibit 2.)  No evidence was presented to me containing any supporting\ndocumentation from the interviews where the Applicant was alleged to have made these\nstatements. Factual conclusions of third parties about what the Applicant allegedly told\nthem, without supporting documentation, is insufficient to prove that the information is\naccurate or correct.  As an independent trier of fact, I am not bound by their findings,\nwhich I have no way of knowing are correct.  Based upon the evidence presented, this\nallegation is found for the Applicant.\nAllegation 1(j) During an interview with a DoD investigator on April 5, 2007, the\nGovernment alleges that the Applicant falsified material facts in that he stated that he\nsmoked marijuana in cigarette form two times in December 1999, and that he had not\nsmoked marijuana from December 1999 to the present, when in fact he had used\nmarijuana to at least September 2003.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  No evidence was\npresented to me containing any supporting documentation from the interviews where\nthe Applicant was alleged to have made these statements.  Factual conclusions of third\nparties about what the Applicant allegedly told them, without supporting documentation,\nis insufficient to prove that the information is accurate or correct.  As an independent\ntrier of fact, I am not bound by their findings, which I have no way of knowing are\ncorrect.  Based upon the evidence presented, this allegation is found for the Applicant.\nAllegation 1(k) The Applicant completed a security clearance application dated\nApril 11, 2006.  Question 24(a) asked him if since the age of sixteen or in the last seven\nyears, whichever is shorter, has he illegally used any controlled substance.  The\nApplicant responded, \u201cYES\u201d, and listed that he used marijuana twice in December 1999.\n(Government Exhibit 1.)  The Government alleges that he failed to list his use of\nmarijuana to at least September 2003.  No evidence was presented to me containing\nany supporting documentation from the interviews where the Applicant was alleged to\nhave made these statements. Factual conclusions of third parties about what the\nApplicant allegedly told them, without supporting documentation, is insufficient to prove\nthat the information is accurate or correct.  As an independent trier of fact, I am not\nbound by their findings, which I have no way of knowing are correct.  Based upon the\nevidence presented, this allegation is found for the Applicant.\nAllegation 1(l) Question 24(b) of the same application asked him if he ever\nillegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer,\nprosecutor, or courtroom official, while possession a security clearance; or while in a\nposition directly and immediately affecting the public safety.  The Applicant responded,\n\u201cNO.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 1.)  This was a false response.  The Applicant failed to\ndisclose that he had used marijuana while holding a DoD Top Secret clearance.   \nAllegation 1(m) Question 26(b) of the same application asked the Applicant if, to\nhis knowledge, has he ever had a clearance or access authorization denied,\nsuspended, or revoked , or has he been debarred from government employment.  The\nApplicant responded, \u201cYES\u201d, and stated that he truthfully supplied information about his\ntwice usage of marijuana upon which they revoked his security clearance.  (Government\n\n5\nExhibit 1.)  The Government alleges that he failed to fully disclose his use of marijuana\nand the basis for the security clearance revocation.  No evidence was presented to me\ncontaining any supporting documentation from the interviews where the Applicant was\nalleged to have made these statements.  Factual conclusions of third parties about what\nthe Applicant allegedly told them, without supporting documentation, is insufficient to\nprove that the information is accurate or correct.  As an independent trier of fact, I am\nnot bound by their findings, which I have no way of knowing are correct.  Based upon\nthe evidence presented, this allegation is found for the Applicant.\nSix witnesses, including his supervisor, coworkers, and long time friends and\nassociates of the Applicant, testified on his behalf.  They know him to be extremely\nhonest, trustworthy, loyal, dependable, and a person of high integrity.  They have never\nknown him to lie or be untruthful and recommend him for a position of trust.  (Tr. pp. 41-\n110.)      \nThe Applicant\u2019s brother, a judge, and adjunct professor of law who considers\nhimself close to the Applicant, testified that the Applicant contacted him months after the\nadjudication process, and informed him of the allegations that were the basis of his\nsecurity clearance revocation.  His brother testified that the Applicant did not tell him\nthat he has ever used marijuana or cocaine, and if he were to learn that he did, he\nwould be in disbelief.  (Tr. p. 100.)  \nLetters of recommendation from numerous professional and business\nassociates, including directors, managers, engineers, military officers, and friends, as\nwell as his brother, his father, and his landlord, describe the Applicant as an outstanding\nperformer with excellent leadership, communication, interpersonal relationship,\nanalytical, and mathematical skills.  He is said to be dedicated to his work, honest,\nreliable, trustworthy, and a highly valued asset to the organization.  He has their highest\nrecommendation for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and C.)\nThe Applicant has received a number of awards and recognitions, including out-\nof-cycle merit raises and other bonus.  In 1998, he received the Meritorious Unit Citation\nfor superior performance from May 1995 through June 1998.  In 1998, he received one\nof the highest awards of the company, the Presidential Achievement Award, for\noutstanding job performance and technical excellence.  He has made many significant\ncontributions to the company and is considered a true asset to the organization.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\n\n6\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16. (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n17. (f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n7\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole-person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in dishonesty that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has not met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant falsified his security clearance application, (Guideline E.)  The totality of this\nevidence indicates good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness on the part of the\nApplicant.  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines E of the SOR.  \nThe problem in this case in that the documents supporting the factual allegations\nare third hand statements.  These documents were prepared by unknown third parties,\nwhich are presumed to be based on alleged statements of the Applicant.  These\n\n8\ndocuments were not presented to me.  In fact, no evidence was presented to me\ncontaining any supporting documentation from the interviews where the Applicant was\nalleged to have made these statements.  Any fair evaluation of the evidence must take\ninto account the Applicant\u2019s absolute denials, as opposed to the dearth of supporting\ndocumentation.  \nThere is no independent evidence in the record to support the fact that the\nApplicant used marijuana fifty times, that he used cocaine fifty times, or that he\ncontributed money to the purchase of marijuana.  He stated emphatically to the\ncontrary.  Accordingly, I cannot find that he intentionally failed to disclose this\ninformation to the Government during this investigation.       \nThe Applicant did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application,\nresponses to interrogatories, nor did he provide false information to an investigator\nduring his background investigation concerning his past illegal drug use.  First, the\ninformation is not substantiated.  Secondly, although the Applicant used marijuana in\n2000, after having been granted a security clearance, there is no evidence in the record\nthat he intended to falsify his questionnaire.  Furthermore, this occurred over ten years\nago and he has no intentions of ever using any illegal drug again.  Under Guideline E,\nPersonal Conduct, Disqualifying Condition 16.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies to the allegations.  Under the\nparticular facts of this case, Mitigating Condition 17.(f) the information was\nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability also applies.  Consequently,\nI find for the Applicant under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s credibility is critical in this case.  His testimony was credible and\nconsistent with his written statements that include the information he provided in\nresponse to interrogatories, in his security clearance application, and during his\ninterview with the investigator.  Whether the Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s long illness and\neventual death caused him to be indifferent to the decision to revoke his security\nclearance, or whether he was simply overwhelmed and felt defeated by the gross\ninaccuracies in the decision, is unclear.  In hindsight, however,  the Applicant realizes\nthat he should have appealed the decision of the agency that based its decision on\nfalse, incorrect or inaccurate information.  Although there is a presumption that the\ninformation relied upon by the other agency was correct, it is not substantiated, nor\ndoes the fact that he did not appeal the decision prove that the information was\naccurate.     \nThere are many blind assertions here.  The only sound evidence presented is the\nfact that the Applicant used marijuana after having been granted a security clearance in\n2000, however, this occurred over ten years ago.  Since then, the Applicant has not\nused any illegal drug, and has no intentions of ever using any drugs in the future.  \n\n9\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information, including the favorable testimony from\npeople who know him well, and the numerous letters or recommendation submitted on\nhis behalf.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth\nunder all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole-person assessment of\ngood judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the person may properly\nsafeguard classified information.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does meet the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct.)     \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraphs 1 of the SOR.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n10\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The charge was dismissed. In 2006, Applicant was arrested for \ndriving while intoxicated (DWI), which resulted in a 2009 conviction. Applicant has \nrebutted or mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns under criminal conduct and \nalcohol consumption. Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the DoD on September 1, 2006. \n \n1 \nMay 12, 2010\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on July 27, 2009, detailing security concerns under \ncriminal conduct and alcohol consumption. \n  \n \nOn September 21, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. \nOn October 15, 2009, I was assigned the case. On November 5, 2009, DOHA issued a \nNotice of Hearing scheduling the hearing, which was held on November 18, 2009. At \nthe hearing, the Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were admitted \ninto evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through I, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. On December 1, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admits the factual allegations in the SOR, \nwith explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated \nherein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old, has worked for a defense contractor since September \n2007, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. On September 1, 2007, Applicant \nretired from the United States Air Force with 25 years honorable service. (Tr. 32) \nCoworkers and friends indicate Applicant demonstrates good work ethics, has sound \njudgment, is reliable, and trustworthy. (Ex. A\u2014E)  \n \nFrom 1981 through 2008, Applicant, at times, consumed alcohol to excess. In \n2004, Applicant was arrested for failure to stop and give information. Applicant was \ninvolved in a vehicle accident where his vehicle struck another car, which spun the other \ncar around before it struck the guard rail. (Ex. 3) Applicant was in a pool league and had \nbeen drinking prior the accident. (Tr. 51) His attention was directed at his car\u2019s \nradio/tape deck when he noticed he was quickly approaching the car in front of him. He \nwas unsuccessful in his attempt to swerve to keep from striking the other car. (Tr. 35) \nHis vehicle also spun around striking the guard rail and doing damage to his door and \nthe rear door. (Tr. 35) He indicated he was scared and disoriented and kept driving \nfollowing the accident. (Tr. 36) Ten minutes later, he was arrested eight to ten miles \naway as he continued to drive home. (Ex. 3, 5, Tr. 36) Applicant was administered and \npassed a field sobriety test. (Tr. 36)  \n \nIn August 2004, Applicant divorced from his wife of ten years. While going \nthrough the divorce, Applicant admitted he would drink more often. (Ex. 3, Tr. 35) He \nwent to bars with friends three to four times a week and on weekends. (Ex. 3)  \n \nIn April 2006, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI). \nApplicant fell asleep while driving home and hit a parked car. (Tr. 38) Prior to the \naccident he was playing pool and had three or four beers in a four hour period. He then \nwent to another bar, had two more beers and three shots of tequila during an hour and \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n \n2 \n\na half period. (Ex. 3) At the time of the accident, Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol content (BAC) \nwas .12, which exceeded the legal limit (Ex. 5, Tr. 39, 72)  \n \nApplicant received a letter of reprimand from his commander and his base driving \nprivileges were revoked for one year. (Ex. 2, Tr. 66) With the loss of driving privileges, \nApplicant did much walking and soul-searching. (Tr. 40) The walking gave him plenty of \ntime to think about things. (Tr. 41) In April 2006, Applicant underwent a comprehensive \npsychiatric evaluation for alcohol abuse and was deemed not to have a substance \nabuse disorder. (Ex. 2) In May 2006, Applicant completed the one-day Alcohol Drug \nAbuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) training at his air base. (Ex. 2, Tr. 65) \nApplicant decided to abstain from drinking. He completed the state approved defensive \ndriving course. He attended school and completed his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) \ndegree in social psychology. (Ex. 2)  \n \nIn August 2006, Applicant was interviewed about his drinking. (Ex. 3) He stated \nhe had stopped drinking on April 18, 2006, because he felt he might have had a \nproblem with drinking, but did not believe he was an alcoholic. (Ex. 3, Tr. 57) Applicant \nsaw his 2006 arrest as a \u201cwake-up\u201d call. (Tr. 59) From April 2006 through early 2008, \nApplicant abstained from drinking alcohol. In early 2008, Applicant resumed drinking \nlimiting his alcohol consumption on occasion. (Tr. 68, 74) In July 2009, following the \nreceipt of the SOR, he decided to quit drinking for health reasons. (Ex. 2, Tr. 42) He \ndoes not intend to drink in the future. (Tr. 64)  \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant made a signed, sworn statement in which he \nstated: \n \nSince the arrest in 2006, I consume no more than four beers a week. I \nhave been intoxicated, but do not know how many times. I do not have a \nproblem with alcohol and intend on drinking responsibly in the future. I no \nlonger consume to the level of intoxication . . . (Tr. 5, page 3 of 4) \n \nOn November 16, 2009, two days before his security clearance hearing, the \nfailure to stop charge was dismissed and Applicant was sentenced for his DWI \nconviction. (Ex. F, G) There was no explanation as to why the matter did not go to court \nsooner. Applicant was sentenced to a $300 fine, $399 in court costs, $90 supervisor fee \nfor probation, and 180 days in the county jail (suspended). (Ex. G, Tr. 28) Applicant paid \nthe court $781. (Ex. I) Applicant was required to perform 24 hours of community service, \nordered to complete a certified DWI Education Program (AIDE), to complete an Alcohol \nTreatment Evaluation (ATPE), and complete DWI Victim Impact Panel (DIP). Starting \nNovember 16, 2009, he was sentenced to six months probation. As of the hearing, \nApplicant had yet to meet with his probation officer, start his community service, or \ncomplete AIDE, ATPE, or DIP. (Tr. 46)  \n \nSince his arrest, Applicant has become more involved with his parents, siblings, \nhis fianc\u00e9, and five children ranging in age from two to twenty-six. (Tr. 49) He often acts \nas the designated driver when he goes out with others.  \n \n3 \n\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to \ncriminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Potentially disqualifying conditions are: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \nApplicant was arrested in 2004 for failure to stop and give information following \nan automobile accident. The charge was dismissed. In 2006, he was charged with DWI. \nIn November 2009, he was sentenced on his DWI conviction to pay $781 for a fine, \ncourt costs, and supervisory fee. His 180 days jail sentence was suspended. He was \nsentenced to six month probation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(c), and 31(d) apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Those that are \npotentially mitigating are: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement; and, \n \n \nAlthough only recently sentenced\u2014two days before the hearing\u2014the most recent \noffence occurred more than two and a half years earlier. AG \u00b6 32(a) applies. Although \nApplicant was divorced in August 2004 and was going out drinking more often while the \n \n5 \n\ndivorce was proceeding, this is not the type of pressure contemplated in AG \u00b6 32(b). AG \n\u00b6 32(b) does not apply. There is evidence of successful rehabilitation including his work \nperformance and his completing his B.S. degree. There has been no additional criminal \nactivity in more than two and a half years and he is well respected at work. AG \u00b6 32(d) \napplies. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nApplicant was arrested and convicted of DWI. AG \u00b6 22(a) Aalcohol-related \nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other criminal incidents of concern, regardless \nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,@ \napplies. \n \nPrior to his 2004 arrest for failure to stop and give information following an \nautomobile accident, Applicant had been playing pool and drinking beer. Following his \narrest, he successfully passed a field sobriety test. No alcohol related charges arose out \nof the accident. It was Applicant\u2019s inattention and not his alcohol consumption that \ncaused this accident.  \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security \nconcerns. Those that potentially apply are: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sole alcohol-related arrest occurred more than two and a half years \nago. Applicant has admitted to being intoxicated on other occasions, but there is no \nevidence these periods of intoxication led to any involvement with the law or other \n \n6 \n\nadverse action when these periods of intoxication occurred. The record fails to indicate \nwhen these periods occurred. Following his most recent arrest, Applicant did not drink \nfrom April 2006 until early 2008. From early 2008 to July 2009, he limited his drinking. In \nJuly 2009, following his receipt of the SOR, he again chose to abstain from drinking. \nEven though abstinence is required only for those diagnosed as alcohol dependent, \nApplicant has established a pattern of abstinence. He received ADAPT counseling while \nin the Air Force. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(d) apply. AG \u00b6 23(d) does not fully apply because \nApplicant has not received a favorable prognosis as required in the AG \u00b6 22(d). \nApplicant realized his drinking did not improve his life.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is motivated to refrain from \nall use of alcohol and is committed to maintaining abstinence. The evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation including obtaining his B.S. degree was also considered. \n \nApplicant has had a single alcohol related arrest\u2014the 2006 DWI. He has been \ninvolved in no additional adverse action in more than two and a half years. He currently \nabstains from alcohol use. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the criminal conduct and alcohol consumption \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n7 \n\n \n8 \n \nParagraph 1, Criminal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a and 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Alcohol Consumption:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a and 2.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Her eligibility for a security clearance is \ngranted. \n \nOn March 28, 2005, Applicant signed and certified a Security Clearance \nApplication (SF-86).1 On October 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \n \n1Applicant\u2019s SF-86 showed she had signed the document on February 24, 2005 and March 28, 2005.  \nThe two signatures did not represent two versions of the same document, and she made no changes to \nthe SF-86 between February 24, 2005 and March 28, 2005. (Tr. 119-120.) \nMay 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Her answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on December 11, \n2008.  On February 26, 2009, Department Counsel gave notice that he was ready to \nproceed. On that same day, the case was assigned to me. I convened a hearing on \nApril 14, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government called no \nwitnesses and introduced four exhibits (Ex.), which were marked as Applicant\u2019s Ex. 1 \nthrough 4, and admitted to the record without objection. The Government also offered \nfacts in seven official U.S. government documents for administrative notice. (HE I.) \nApplicant did not object to administrative notice of facts in the Government\u2019s \ndocuments. Applicant introduced two exhibits, which were marked as Ex. A and B and \nadmitted to the record without objection. She called one witness and testified on her \nown behalf.  \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until close of business \nApril 24, 2009, so that Applicant could, if she wished, submit additional information. \nApplicant timely filed five additional documents. These exhibits were marked as \nApplicant\u2019s Ex. C through G and admitted to the record without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on April 22, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains five allegations that raise security concerns under the Foreign \nInfluence adjudicative guideline (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.). In her Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted four of the allegations and denied one, with explanation. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are admitted herein as findings of fact.   \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record in the case, including witness testimony, \nexhibits, relevant policies, and applicable adjudicative guidelines, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old, never married, and employed as an Arabic linguist \nrecruiter by a government contractor. She has worked as a federal contractor since \n2003. She seeks a security clearance. (Ex. 1.) \n \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Egypt. She received a Bachelor of Science \ndegree from a university in Egypt.  She came to the United States as a tourist in 1994.  \nAfter her tourist visa expired, she obtained a student visa. As a student, she supported \nherself with a variety of jobs, including childcare and administrative work. One of her \nemployers sponsored her for a work permit and a U.S. Permanent Resident Card \n\n \n3 \n \n \n(Green Card). She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in human resources \nmanagement from a U.S. university. She became a U.S. citizen in September 2002. \nShe purchased a home in the United States in 2006.  (Ex. 1;  Ex. 3; Ex. G; Tr. 59-69.) \n \n \nBefore becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant used her Egyptian passport for travel. \nShe no longer has an active Egyptian passport. When she became a U.S. citizen, \nApplicant orally renounced her Egyptian citizenship.  Later, during an interview with a \nU.S. government agency, she voluntarily signed statements that she was not a citizen of \nEgypt and she again renounced her Egyptian citizenship. Since becoming a U.S. \ncitizen, Applicant has used only her U.S. passport for travel outside of the United \nStates. (Ex. 3; Ex. 4 at 19; Tr. 99- 01.) \n \n \nSince coming to the United States, Applicant has traveled to Egypt five times.  In \n1999, she traveled to Egypt to comfort her family after one of her younger sisters was \nkilled in an automobile accident. In 2000, Applicant returned to Egypt to visit her \nparents.  In 2003, Applicant went with a group of professional colleagues to a wedding \nin Egypt, but she did not visit her family members, who lived elsewhere in Egypt. In \n2004 and 2008, Applicant also traveled to Egypt to visit her family. (Tr. 93-99, 121-122.) \n \n \nApplicant does not intend to return to Egypt or to stay there for any length of \ntime. As a single woman, she could not travel freely in certain areas in Egypt or wear \nWestern clothing. She appreciates the freedom she is accorded as an American citizen: \n\u201cYes, [in America] I feel like a complete person.  I can study whatever I feel like at any \ntime. I can do it if I feel like it, but in Egypt, it\u2019s going to be very difficult or almost \nimpossible if I don\u2019t have a man to protect me or someone to take care of me.\u201d  (Tr. 90-\n92.)   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Egypt. Applicant\u2019s father is \napproximately 80 years old, blind, bed-ridden, and unable to speak. Approximately 40 \nyears ago, he retired early as a policeman in an Egyptian city because he had a heart \nailment. Applicant sponsored her mother for U.S. permanent resident status. For the \npast four years, Applicant\u2019 mother has resided with Applicant in the United States for six \nmonths each year. Applicant\u2019s mother expects to apply for U.S. citizenship in about one \nyear.  Because of Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s serious health situation, her mother will likely \nreturn to live in Egypt after becoming a U.S. citizen.  Applicant provides her parents with \napproximately $200 each month to help with their living expenses. (Tr. 82-89, 105-107.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger sister came to the United States as a tourist in 1998. \nApproximately six months later, Applicant sponsored her sister when she applied for a \nstudent visa. The sister later married a naturalized U.S. citizen, who sponsored her for \nU.S. citizenship. Applicant\u2019s sister, who is now divorced, became a U.S. citizen in July \n2005, and she resides in the United States. After becoming a U.S. citizen, the sister \nrelinquished her Egyptian citizenship. Her last trip to Egypt was in December 2005, after \nshe became a U.S. citizen.  She used her U.S. passport to travel to Egypt. (Ex. A; Ex. \nB; Tr. 41-55.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers are citizens and residents of Egypt. Her younger brother \nis a student and studying to become a computer engineer. Her older brother, who is \nmarried and the father of four children, formerly worked as an accountant and now \nteachers English at a high school. Although she has good relations with her brothers, \nApplicant is not in frequent contact with them. She telephones them occasionally to \ninquire after the health of her father and mother. None of Applicant\u2019s immediate \nrelatives have any connections to the government of Egypt.  She owns no property in \nEgypt; she has no bank accounts in Egypt; and she has no business ties with Egypt. \n(Tr. 88-90, 107-109, 126.) \n \n \nIn 2002, soon after becoming a U.S. citizen and after learning of the U.S. \nmilitary\u2019s need for Arab speakers to assist them in Iraq and Afghanistan, Applicant \napplied for a position as a contract Arab linguist and interpreter. She was accepted and \nsent to Iraq in April 2003, where, she served for two years as an Arab language \ninterpreter. During that time, she accompanied troops on tactical raids and provided \ninterpretations during interrogations. She also served as primary interpreter for military \ncommanders in meetings with local officials, and served as a translator to assist \nwounded detainees and civilians. In her spare time, she taught Arabic to the U.S. \ntroops, which aided them in their day-to-day interactions with Iraqis. During this time, \nshe held an interim security clearance without incident. (Ex. C; Tr. 69-74, 113.) \n \n \nOne enlisted serviceman and two officers who worked with Applicant during her \nservice in Iraq provided letters of character reference for her and described her role in \ntheir military operations. In November 2003, after observing Applicant on the job for \nnearly four months, a Staff Sergeant described Applicant\u2019s contribution to the mission \nas follows: \n \n[Applicant] was on call, 24 hours a day and seven days a week. She has \ngiven up numerous hours of down-time in order to accomplish any \ntranslation mission required by the [omission]. She has assisted with all \ntypes of humanitarian missions by translating for local nationals who come \nto the front gate seeking assistance. [Applicant] has freely gone on tactical \nraids with . . . units to ensure the correct person is detained and to provide \nany on-site translations as required. These missions are not without their \ninherent risks and she is to be commended on her dedication to the \nmission at hand. \n \n(Ex. C.) \n \n \nIn January 2004, a U.S. military officer who worked closely with Applicant had \nthis to say about her: \n \nI enthusiastically write this letter on behalf of [Applicant].  [Applicant] has \nserved with distinction as an interpreter for this office since November \n2003 and has excelled far above my expectations. Indeed, she has \nbecome a trusted junior partner of the overall legal team responsible for \n\n \n5 \n \n \nreconstituting the entire judicial system in . . . Iraq.  Without exception, \n[Applicant] responded affirmatively and positively no matter how \nunorthodox or unusual the task.  Whether it was questioning a witness in a \nhospital, talking to community leaders, or simply talking to claimants on a \nday-to-day basis, she was unflinching in her devotion to the task at hand \nand mission of the [military] over all. Her positive attitude was just \nremarkable. \n \n[Applicant\u2019s] high-powered personality buoyed the entire office and \nestablished a progressive tone for the daily grind [of] serving dozens of \ndisgruntled claimants. She often had to deal with claimants who were \nbelligerent, insistent, stubborn, emotional, or just plain unfriendly.  She \nalways maintained that razor\u2019s edge when dealing with them, but just as \nimportant, she never once went over the edge with them either.  She was \na picture of efficiency and professionalism. At once she could \nappropriately admonish an irate or unruly claimant and in the same \nmoment gently stroke or console a bewildered child. That range of \ncomposure and control was a magnificent attribute to our office because \nsome of the cases were so incredibly sad or moving while some claimants \nwere clearly crooks or thieves.  Her perceptive language skills facilitated \nascertaining the genuine claimants from the liars and swindlers. \n \nOne attribute it was my pleasure to discover unintentionally was \n[Applicant\u2019s] extraordinary loyalty to the United States and the Coalition \nForces.  One day while listening to her without her knowledge, I heard her \ntell each claimant that we paid on pay day to stop supporting the \ninsurrection against the Americans and to tell their children to stop \nthrowing stones at Americans.  This was an unsolicited act of loyalty to her \ncountry and the Coalition Forces. She was trying to change [Iraq] one \nclaimant at a time. That act of concern for the Coalition Forces and for \nAmerica\u2019s fighting men and women provides a window into this woman\u2019s \nheart of integrity and compassion. \n \n(Ex. D.) \n \n \nOn June 30, 2004, another officer for whom Applicant worked observed the \nfollowing about her: \n \n[Applicant] successfully rises to meet the challenges of her job.  She \nefficiently and professionally deals with our largely male claimant \npopulation, many of whom ware hostile, indignant, or outraged over their \ncar accidents raids, injuries, detention, or other traumatic events. Some \nclaimants resist cooperating with her because she is female or because \nher dialect varies from their own.  She is kind and patient with older folks \nand children. Though she often finds the Iraqi tendency to respond to \nquestions evasively and without specific detail frustrating, she persists and \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nadapts the questioning to obtain the information we need.  She exercises \npatience with our claimants even when under the stress that a long line of \nhot and impatient claimants creates. \n \n(Ex. E.) \n \n \nApplicant found value in being of service to the Coalition Forces, and she took \naction to file an application to join the U.S. military. Then, after almost two years of \nservice in Iraq, Applicant was injured when a suicide bomber self-detonated in the base \nmess hall as she was passing nearby.  In the confusion, she ran to get away from the \nexplosion, and seriously injured her mouth and face when she hit the side of a bunker. \nShe also received a wound when shrapnel pierced several bones in one of her feet.  \n(Tr. 75-78.) \n \n \nThe extent of Applicant\u2019s injuries was not immediately clear. She remained in \nIraq for two more months. Her foot became infected, and she was evacuated to \nGermany, where military doctors advised amputation of the foot. Applicant elected \ninstead to return to the United States for treatment. She underwent surgery for the \nshrapnel wound in 2005. As a result of her surgery, the bone did not knit correctly, and \nApplicant was scheduled for more surgery on her foot in April 2009. She wears dental \nbraces to repair the damage done to her teeth and mouth when she hit the bunker. \nBecause of her injuries and the required treatments, Applicant was unable to follow \nthrough on her plan to join the U.S. military. (Tr. 77-82.)   \n \n  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Egypt, as provided by \nDepartment Counsel from official documents of the United States government2: \n \nEgypt is the most populous country in the Arab world and the second-most \npopulous on the African Continent. It is a republic with a developing \neconomy and has a strong executive. In October of 1981, Islamic \nextremists assassinated President al-Sadat; Hosni Mubarek, his Vice \nPresident, was elected to succeed him. President Mubarek has \nsubsequently been confirmed by popular referendum for four more 6 year \nterms, most recently in 2005. \n \n \n2 The documents from which these facts are drawn are as follows: U.S. Department of State, Background \nNote: Egypt, dated March 2008 (11 pages); U.S. Department of State, Egypt Country Specific \nInformation, dated December 15, 2008 (6 pages); U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on \nTerrorism: Chapter 2 - Country Reports: Middle East and North Africa Overview, dated April 30, 2008 (19 \npages); U.S. Department of State, Patterns of Global Terrorism, Middle East Overview, dated April 29, \n2004 (13 pages); U.S. Department of State, Patterns of Global Terrorism, Appendix B \u2013 Background \nInformation on Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, dated April 29, 2004 (26 pages); U.S. \nDepartment of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, 2008 Country Reports on Human \nRights Practices, 2008 Human Rights Report: Egypt, dated February 25, 2009 (30 pages), and CRS \nReport for Congress, Egypt: Background and U.S. Relations, Congressional Research Service, updated \nAugust 12, 2008 (31 pages). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe United States and Egypt enjoy a strong and friendly relationship \nbased on shared mutual interest in Middle East peace and stability, \nstrengthening trade relations, and promoting regional security. The \nEgyptian government receives substantial U.S. foreign aid.  In the last two \nyears, the Mubarak regime has \u2018cracked down on [its] domestic \nopponents.\u2019  Many in the U.S. government have expressed concern about \nthis crackdown and believe that the U.S. aid should be used to force the \nEgyptian government to ease its restrictions on the personal freedoms of \nits citizens, move to a more democratic government, and institute overdue \neconomic reforms.  The Mubrak government faces increasing political \nunrest from various groups, both secular and religious, with its most \nthreatening opposition coming from a radical Islamic group called the \nMuslim Brotherhood, which the government has banned as a political \nparty. \n \nEgypt has aggressively pursued domestic terrorists and has instituted a \n\u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy on extremism.  Nevertheless, the threat of terrorism \nin Egypt remains and transnational terrorist groups and local terrorist \ngroups pose threats in Egypt.  For example, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad \n[AKA, Al-Jihad] merged with Al-Qaida in June 2001, and in 2003, Egypt \ndiscovered and disrupted a terrorist plot against U.S. interests.  Further, \nbetween 2004 and 2006, Egypt suffered a series of deadly terrorist attacks \ncausing many deaths and injuries, including U.S. citizens.  While the \nEgyptian government took measures against the perpetrators of the 2004 \nand 2005 attacks, the April 2006 bombings reflect a persistent, indigenous \nthreat of terror activities. \n \nThe State Department notes that Egypt\u2019s human rights record is poor and \nserious abuses continue in many areas.  Problems include: limitations on \nthe right of citizens to change their government, torture, arbitrary arrest, \nprolonged detention, poor conditions in prisons, executive branch limits on \nan independent judiciary, political prisoners and detainees, and \nrestrictions on freedom of press, assembly, and association, and religion, \nincluding Internet freedom. Torture occurs frequently in Egyptian detention \ncenters. \n \nThe Government of Egypt considers all children born to Egyptian fathers \nto be Egyptian citizens.  Male dual nationals staying in Egypt for more \nthan six months from the date of arrival and who have not completed \nmilitary service are generally required to enlist in the armed forces.  \nPersons with dual nationality who travel to Egypt on their Egyptian \npassports are normally treated as Egyptian citizens by the local \ngovernment. The ability to provide U.S. consular assistance to those \ntraveling on Egyptian passports is extremely limited. \n \n(HE 1, footnotes omitted.)  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nOfficial U.S. government documents provided by Department Counsel \nemphasize that the United States and Egypt have a strong and positive relationship \nbased on their mutual interest in maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East.  The \nEgyptian government does not target U.S. citizens in order to obtain classified \ninformation from them.  However, despite the government of Egypt\u2019s aggressive actions \nto put down domestic and international terrorist groups within its borders, the threat of \nterrorism remains.  Between 2004 and 2006, Egypt suffered several serious terrorist \nattacks which caused considerable loss of life to civilians, including U.S. citizens. \n \n \nAdditionally, the U.S. government recognizes that Egypt has carried out human \nrights abuses against its own citizens. The government\u2019s human rights abuses include   \ntorture, arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention, executive branch limits on an independent \njudiciary, and restrictions on freedom of press, assembly, association, and religion.    \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline. Applicant denied the SOR allegation at \u00b6 1.d., and she provided \ndocumentation to corroborate her statement that her sister is now a citizen and resident \nof the United States.  Accordingly, SOR \u00b6 1.d. is concluded for Applicant. \n \nThe government provided substantial evidence to support its factual allegations \nthat Applicant\u2019s aged parents are citizens and residents of Egypt; that her mother has \nresident alien status in the United States and hopes to become a U.S. citizen; that  \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers are also citizens and residents of Egypt; and that Applicant has \ntraveled to Egypt to visit her family five times since 1999, suggesting close and on-going \ncontacts with them. These facts raise security concerns under disqualifying conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                           \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d 3 AG \u00b6 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation.\u201d   \n \n \nApplicant admitted factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.e., and the \nburden shifted to her to mitigate the resulting security concerns. Several mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s case.  If \u201cthe nature of the \nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or \nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the \nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the \nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might apply.  If \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(c) \nmight apply.  \n \n \nApplicant is a dutiful daughter, and she has strong filial relationships with her \nfather, who is a citizen and resident of Egypt, and with her mother who is a citizen of \nEgypt with U.S. resident alien status. She stays in contact with her parents and with her \nbrothers in Egypt and is concerned about their well-being. Her relationship with her \nfamily members in Egypt is based on long-standing family ties of affection and \nobligation.  \n \n \nEgypt is a long-standing ally of the United States and cooperates with the United \nStates in combating terrorism. The government of Egypt does target U.S. citizens to \nacquire protected information. The positions and activities of Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers in Egypt do not involve the government or the military, and they would have \nno interest in acquiring protected information.  Only their physical presence in Egypt \ncreates the potential that Applicant would confront a choice between their interests and \nthe security interests of the United States. Thus, AG \u00b6 8(a) has some application. \n \n \nApplicant produced significant evidence establishing mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n8(b). Based on her relationship with and depth of loyalty to the United States, she can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of U.S. interests. She has \ncommitted to a life as a U.S. citizen. She purchased a home and owns property in the \n \n3 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb.8, 2001). \n\n \n11 \n \n \nUnited States. She does not own property or possess bank accounts in Egypt. \nSignificantly, Applicant volunteered to assist the U.S. military in Iraq as an Arabic \nlinguist and translator. For two years, while in Iraq, she willingly risked her life to support \nU.S. troops and U.S. interests. Several of her commanders attested to her honorable \nservice to her country as an Arab linguist in Iraq. \n \n \nWhile Applicant attempted to establish mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(c) by \ndescribing her contacts with her two brothers in Egypt as infrequent and only \noccasioned by inquiries to them about her parents\u2019 health and well-being, she did not \nestablish that her relationships with her brothers were casual.  While perhaps sporadic, \nher relationships with her brothers were on-going and familial.  Accordingly, AG \u00b6 8(c) \ncannot be given full application. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nwhole person concept and all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Two \ncircumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. First, even though \nEgypt is an ally of the United States, it has committed serious human rights abuses \nagainst its own citizens. Second, four of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members are \ncitizens and residents of Egypt, raising the possibility that they could be subject to such \nabuses, which could raise security concerns for Applicant. \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance.  Out of a sense of patriotism and love for the United States, Applicant joined \nU.S. troops in Iraq as an Arab-speaking linguist. She took part in high risk operations in \nsupport of the troops. Nothing in her record suggests that she has ever taken an action \nthat would cause potential harm to the United States. She takes her loyalty to the United \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                           \nStates seriously. Those who witnessed her work as an Arab linguist and translator in \nIraq assessed her as trustworthy, conscientious, responsible, and dedicated.   \n \nApplicant held an interim security clearance during her tenure with U.S. military \nforces in Iraq without any indication that she breached security policies or procedures. \nWhile this fact is not normally considered as a significant factor in granting a security \nclearance, DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board has noted the following exception: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006).  \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006).  The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \n \n(ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006.)  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, including Applicant\u2019s commendable \nperformance as a linguist and translator in Iraq, I conclude Applicant has fully mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.4 Overall, the record evidence \nleaves no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For \nall these reasons, I conclude that Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline B. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n4 I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Assuming that a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions \narticulated under AG \u00b6 8 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person \nanalysis standing alone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case.  \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B  \n \nFOR  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is   \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Hoffman, Esq. Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Applications (SCAs) on March 13,\n2007 and May 21, 2008. On June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder drug use (Guideline H), and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was\ntaken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on July 17, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on August 28, 2008, and the hearing was held on September 11,\n2008. At the hearing, four exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) were admitted in evidence\nwithout objection to support the government\u2019s case. Applicant testified and offered four\nexhibits. (AE A through AE D) Department DOHA received a copy of the hearing\nSeptember 24, 2008\n\n On May 12, 2008, Applicant swore the contents of the September 2007 interview were true and accurate to\n1\nthe best of his knowledge and belief. \n2\ntranscript on September 19, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains three allegations under the drug involvement guideline, and\none allegation under the personal conduct guideline. Applicant admitted SOR 1.a. and\n1.b., but denied SOR 1.c. and 2.a. \nApplicant is 21 years old, single, with no children. Applicant is a co-op student\nand a teaching assistant at a local university. As a co-op student, Applicant is employed\nby the university in alternating semesters to work on classified projects that the\nuniversity has with various user agencies such as the United States Air Force (USAF).\nIn December 2009, he anticipates receiving his college degree in computer science with\na speciality in networking. He seeks a security clearance. \nDrug Involvement\nAt the age of 19 (October 2006), Applicant used marijuana two times at parties\ntwo weeks apart. His first use of the drug was triggered by peer pressure and curiosity.\nThe drug had no effect on him. The second time, two weeks later, he used the drug at\nthe second party because he had been told that marijuana usually has no effect the first\ntime the drug used. During the second use, he experienced a dry mouth, hunger, and\npanic sensations.\nIn his first security clearance application (GE 1, SCA) dated February 9, 2007,\nApplicant disclosed the use and stated, \u201cI have tried marijuana, but I never intended to\ngo out and get some for myself. I tried it at a party. I have no[t] intentions to ever try it\nagain.\u201d\nOn September 5, 2007, Applicant recounted his October 2006 experience with\nmarijuana in an interview with an investigator.  He described a third time (age 20) in\n1\nwhich he used the drug in July 2007 during a study-abroad program in a European\ncountry. He was bar hopping with friends and new acquaintances. At some point in the\nevening after consuming alcohol to excess, Applicant yielded to an offer to smoke\nmarijuana. He experienced the same effects as he had the second time he used the\ndrug in October 2006. As he had stated in his February 2007 SCA, he reiterated his\nintention in the September 2007 interview/statement, and at the hearing (Tr. 44) not to\nuse marijuana in the future. He also indicated he had never purchased or sold the drug. \nApplicant mentioned in his answer to the SOR that had he known about his\ninterim clearance (SOR 1.c.), he would not have used the marijuana in July 2007. He\nalso asserted in his answer that marijuana use is legal in the European country where\n\n3\nhe used the drug. His drug use in July 2007 forced him to rethink his drinking practices\nso that he would not face the temptation to use drugs in the future. \nApplicant no longer associates with drug users. (Tr. 58) Neither his family nor his\ngirlfriend use drugs. (Tr. 55) \nConsidering the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s demeanor at the hearing, his\nuse of marijuana within a short period of time after he stated he would not use the drug\ndilutes his credibility in degree. \nPersonal Conduct\nDuring a study-abroad program, Applicant used marijuana in a European country\nin July 2007 while holding an interim security clearance. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant was certified in November 2004 after reaching the highest rank in a\nyoung mens organization. He received formal initiation into a nationally recognized\nscholastic fraternity in January 2007. Applicant received official recognition from the\nassociate dean of his university for his outstanding, freshman academic record. His\npresent cumulative, scholastic average is 3.81, based on a perfect 4-point scoring\nsystem; The only grade below a \u201cB\u201d rating is \u2018probability and statistics.\u2019 (AE C) \nApplicant received special recognition from the USAF for his contributions to a\nproject in early 2008. Applicant\u2019s supervisor considers Applicant to be an outstanding,\njunior software engineer with a bright future. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n4\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement (DI) \n24. The Concern. \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules or regulations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement falls within the scope of DI disqualifying condition\n(DC) 25.a. (any drug abuse) and DI DC 24.c. (illegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia) based on Applicant\u2019s use and possession of marijuana in October\n2006 and July 2007. To use the drug on three occasions, Applicant had to take control\nof the drug so that he could ingest it. Applicant\u2019s expressed intention not to use\nmarijuana again in his February 2007 SCA cannot be blindly accepted because five\nmonths after making the claim, he used the drug on a third occasion. \nDI mitigating condition (MC) 26.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)\nconveys mitigation in Applicant\u2019s case. While he used the drug twice in October 2006,\nand once in July 2007 under the same circumstances, and producing the same effect,\nthe use can only be considered infrequent. Given his forthright disclosure of his July\n\n5\n2007 marijuana use, his job performance, and his scholastic record, his past drug use\ndoes not cast doubt on his current trustworthiness and good judgment. \nThough Applicant does not meet all the elements of DI MC 26.b. (a demonstrated\nnot to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts, (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs are\nused, (3) an appropriate period of abstinence, and a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation), he no longer associates with drug\nusers. Considering his isolated marijuana use in October 2006 and July 2007, his\nstraightforward disclosure of his July 2007 use, and his favorable character evidence,\nthe DI guideline is resolved in his favor. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance\nprocess.\u201d\nApplicant clearly used poor judgment by declaring in October 2006 he would not\nuse drugs again, and then use drugs about nine months later in July 2007, in a foreign\ncountry where marijuana use is legal. His use falls within PC DC 16. c. (credible\nadverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation) and PC DC 16.e. (personal conduct, or concealment of information about\none\u2019s conduct, that creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as\n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that\nis legal in that county but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for\nexploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other group). \nUsing marijuana constitutes credible adverse evidence in several adjudicative\nissue areas that could support a negative whole person assessment under PC DC 16.c.\nIn addition, using drugs in another country where drug use is legal may serve as a basis\nfor exploitation and pressure. To Applicant\u2019s credit, he fully notified the government and\nhis parents about his marijuana use domestically and in the foreign country. Given\nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence and impressive work performance, I conclude\nthat the drug use sufficiently infrequent, and that it is unlikely to recur. PC MC 17.c. (the\noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies.\nApplicant\u2019s disclosures of his drug use to his parents and the government dramatically\n\n6\nreduce his chances of being vulnerable to coercion, and invoke PC MC 17.e. (the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress). The PC guideline is resolved in his favor. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the whole person concept. Nine general policy factors define the WPC.\nThey are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe DI and PC guidelines that have been found in his favor, must still be\nevaluated in the context of the whole person model of the Directive. Applicant was 19 in\n2006 when he first used marijuana. History shows that teenagers are bombarded with\nall types of temptation triggered by group pressure. To achieve status in the group, the\nindividual does what it takes to maintain his \u201cmembership\u201d status. Using drugs is usually\na way to attain status by individuals who are age 19. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use at 19 is\nextenuated by his age. Had he stood by initial intention to refrain from marijuana use,\nthen there would be no need to pursue the inquiry. However, at age 20 he used\nmarijuana again in July 2007 under circumstances that discredit his stated intention nine\nmonths earlier not to use drugs. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s good-faith and prompt disclosure of his drug use in\nSeptember \n2007, \nwhile \nmaintaining \nhis \nscholastic \nachievements \nand \njob\naccomplishments, I am confidant he will follow his intention to forego all drug use in the\nfuture. He has a lifelong affiliation with a worldwide boy\u2019s organization that generally\nprovides a strong foundation for most boys to succeed in life. Applicant\u2019s achievements\nat the university show me the ideals of the boy\u2019s organization are working effectively in\nApplicant\u2019s life. Overall, the positive character evidence provides sufficient justification\nto find for Applicant under the DI and PC guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Drug Involvement, Guideline H): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c. \nFor Applicant\n\n7\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). I find the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from high school in 1996 and received his undergraduate degree in May 2000. Applicant is single. He has held a security clearance since April 2001. He has worked for his current employer since August 2003.

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), implemented in September\n2006. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested an administrative\ndetermination. Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM),\ndated October 21, 2010.  Applicant received the FORM on November 4, 2010, but did\n1\nnot submit a response to the FORM. On December 21, 2010, the Director, DOHA,\nforwarded the case for assignment to an administrative judge. I received the case\nJanuary 12, 2011\n\nThe Government moved to strike this allegation (1.d) in its Argument to FORM. \n      2\n2\nassignment on December 23, 2010. Based on a review of the case file, submissions,\nand exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden regarding the security concerns\nraised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations under\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). I find the\nfollowing additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1996 and received his undergraduate degree in May 2000. Applicant is\nsingle. He has held a security clearance since April 2001. He has worked for his current\nemployer since August 2003. (Item 6)\nApplicant admits that he used marijuana on several occasions from 1995 to\n2002. He also acknowledged that he used ecstasy about four times from about 1997\nuntil April 2009. (Item 3) He acknowledged that he consumed marijuana in a brownie in\nSeptember 2009. He explained that he had no prior knowledge of the illegal drug in the\nbrownie. He admitted that he consumed absinthe in September 2009, but that he did\nnot \u201centirely understand\u201d the illegality of the spirit. (Item 3)  \n2\nApplicant completed security clearance applications (SCA) on July 12, 2000,\nSeptember 4, 2002, and May 9, 2007. (Items 4, 5 and 6). He did not disclose his use of\nmarijuana and ecstasy on these applications. In addition, on January 26, 2007, he\nsigned a company drug policy statement, where he acknowledged illegal drugs as a\nbasis for ineligibility or removal of a security clearance. (Item 11)\nApplicant answered DOHA interrogatories in 2009, and acknowledged his use of\necstasy in college on two occasions. He admitted use of marijuana in 1997 and 1998.\nHe reported his last use of any narcotics, dangerous drugs, psychoactive or controlled\nsubstances, to include marijuana or hashish, as April 19, 2009. (Item 7)\nOn August 25, 2009, Applicant self-reported his recent use of ecstasy (April\n2009) to his company security office. When questioned as to why he decided to\ndisclose the illegal drug use at this point in his career, he stated, \u201cI just figured why not,\nit has been 10 years since I tried it.\u201d In his 2010 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted\nto not complying with the rules of Guideline H (Drug Involvement), but stated he had no\nintention of leaking classified information or putting himself in a position of possible risk.\nHe did not deny that he failed to disclose his use of illegal drugs on three separate\nSCA\u2019s, but he hoped that \u201ccoming clean of all vices voluntarily shall be evidence that he\nis willing to comply and follow the rules.\u201d\n\n3\nWhen Applicant was interviewed in January 2010 by an OPM investigator, he\nacknowledged the use of marijuana. (Item 8) He elaborated that he was curious and\nwanted to experiment with the illegal drug by using a pipe. He smoked marijuana in\nsocial settings with his friends. He reported that he did not enjoy the drugs, but used\nthem due to social pressure. (Item 8) He continued using marijuana and ecstasy until\n2009 with the same friends. \nApplicant stated that he realized his behavior was immature. He also admitted\nthat he knew that using any illegal drugs while holding a security clearance would result\nin revocation of such a clearance. He noted that his priorities and goals have been\nchanging over the past few years. He stated that he has been in social situations where\nillegal drugs were readily available, but he has not used any of the drugs. He hoped to\nbuy a home and limited his social contacts with the drug-using friends. He does not\nintend to use illegal drugs again. He regretted his actions. He stated that he now\nunderstands security regulations regarding drug use. He intends to follow the rules.\nApplicant has never incurred financial difficulties as a result of illegal drug use.\nHe does not believe he was dependent on any drugs. He noted that in 2007, he\nvoluntarily sought counseling due to anxiety over a failed relationship. Applicant\nstressed that the counseling was not due to alcohol or drug use.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible\nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, they are applied\nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe United States Government (Government) must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for\npresenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      4\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      5\n See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive\n      6\ninformation), and EO 10865 \u00a7 7.\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      7\n Id.\n      8\n4\nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is\n3\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion\n4\nis on the applicant.  \n5\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather\nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\n6\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt\n7\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting such information.  The decision to deny an individual a\n8\nsecurity clearance does not necessarily reflect badly on an applicant\u2019s character. It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise \nquestions \nabout an \nindividual's \nreliability \nand\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n\n5\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical\ncompounds \nidentified \nand \nlisted \nin \nthe\nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as\namended \n(e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis,\ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand\nhallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal\ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical\ndirection.\nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use;\n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession\nof drug paraphernalia;\n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g.,\nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse\nor drug dependence;\n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a\nlicensed clinical social worker who, is a staff member of a\nrecognized drug treatment program;\n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program\nprescribed by a duly qualified medical professional;\n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and,\n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to\nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use.\nApplicant admitted his use of illegal drugs (marijuana and ecstasy) on an\nundetermined number of times from approximately 1995 to 2009. He used these drugs\nwhile holding a security clearance initially obtained in 2001. These admissions in his\n\n6\nresponse to DOHA interrogatories and in his answer to the SOR establish a case under\nthis guideline. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the\nfuture, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation;\n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or\nprolonged illness during which these drugs were prescribed,\nand abuse has since ended; and,\n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment\nprogram, including but not limited to rehabilitation and\naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a\nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred in September 2009, more than one\nyear ago. Considering his history of illegal drug use, there is doubt about his ability to\nabstain from future use. Applicant asserted that social pressure was responsible for his\nearly use, but in 2009, he was approximately 30 years old. Given he used drugs for\nmore than ten years, an abstinence of one year is not sufficient passage of time for\nrehabilitation. Applicant expressed regret for his behavior and an intention not to use\ndrugs again, but he still has contact with some of the same friends with whom he used\nillegal drugs. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns under drug involvement.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\n\n7\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 16(a), a disqualifying conditions exists when there is\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 16(b) a disqualifying condition exists when \u201cdeliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d\nApplicant intentionally falsified his SCA\u2019s on three separate occasions while\nholding a security clearance. His last SCA was signed in May 2007. Applicant signed\nhis company drug policy statement in 2007 acknowledging that use of illegal drugs\ncould be a basis for removal and loss of a security clearance. He did not disclose his\nuse of any illegal drugs until his responses to DOHA interrogatories in 2009. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined in AG \u00b6 17, I conclude that\nnone of them apply. Applicant did not make prompt or good-faith efforts to correct his\nfalsification or concealment. He provided no information that indicates he was ill-\nadvised. The intentional omissions occurred as late as 2007, and are too recent and\nserious to be mitigated by the passage of time. I have serious doubts about his good\njudgment and reliability. He has not provided information in this record to show that he\nhas met his burden of proof for his personal conduct.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\n\n8\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is 32 years old. He has a history of behavior that involves dishonesty.\nHe has not shown successful rehabilitation or demonstrated true insight into his\nbehavior. Although Applicant expresses regret for his behavior, his last offense\noccurred just over a year ago. I have doubts about his reliability and judgment based on\nthe information in the record.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and\nE, and evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns based on his drug involvement, and his\nfalsifications on his SCA\u2019s. Accordingly, I conclude that he has not carried his burden of\nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for\naccess to classified information. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nWITHDRAWN\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2., Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\n                                                     \nNOREEN A.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 37 years old and single. He is employed by a defense contractor as an Personnel Clerk, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs. The Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth under this guideline. He used marijuana with varying frequency, from 1994 to at least the spring of 2007. During his personal subject interview, the Applicant identified the time period of his marijuana use as \u201c1994/02/12\" to \u201c2003/09/05\" and the frequency of his marijuana use as \u201clots.\u201d He also stated that he used marijuana \u201cat least once a week\u201d during that time period, and admitted to using it \u201csporadically\u201d after September 2003 to at least the spring of 2007.

DeLaney, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJanuary 25, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF-86) on April 20, 2005.\n (Government Exhibit 5).  On or about February 20, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines H and E for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \n The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 12, 2009, in which he\nelected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on April 13, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in\nrebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on October 7, 2009, and he failed to submit a response.  The case was assigned\n\n2\nto the undersigned for resolution on December 4, 2009.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 37 years old and single.  He is employed by a defense contractor\nas an Personnel Clerk, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth under this guideline.  He\nused marijuana with varying frequency, from 1994 to at least the spring of 2007.  During\nhis personal subject interview, the Applicant identified the time period of his marijuana\nuse as \u201c1994/02/12\" to \u201c2003/09/05\" and the frequency of his marijuana use as \u201clots.\u201d\nHe also stated that he used marijuana \u201cat least once a week\u201d during that time period, and\nadmitted to using it \u201csporadically\u201d after September 2003 to at least the spring of 2007.\n(Government Exhibit 6).  \nApplicant was charged with Possession of Paraphernalia in September 2003.  He\nexplained that he was caught with the remains of a marijuana cigarette that he had\nsmoked the prior weekend.  He was cited and fined.  Three days following this incident,\nthe Applicant used marijuana again.  (Government Exhibit 6).  \nIn April 2005, the Applicant completed a security clearance application.\n(Government Exhibit 5).  He submitted and re-certified the application in April 2006.\n(Government Exhibit 5).  He continued to use marijuana after submitting each of his\nsecurity clearance applications.    \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant admitted with explanations the allegations set forth in the SOR\nunder this guideline.  \nThe Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application dated April 3, 2006.\nQuestion 27 of the application asked the Applicant, if since the age of 16 or in the last 7\nyears, whichever is shorter, had he illegally used any controlled substance, for example,\nmarijuana, cocaine, etc.  The Applicant listed his use of marijuana from 1994 to\nSeptember 2003.  (Government Exhibit 5).  He failed to disclose his marijuana use up to\n2006.  (Government Exhibit 6).  The Applicant argues that when he originally filed his\nsecurity clearance application in April 2005, the information was accurate.  He failed to\nupdate the information when it was re-submitted in April 2006.  He contends that it was\nonly after his interview with an investigator that he realized the information was\n\n3\ninaccurate.  (Government Exhibit 4).  I do not find this excuse credible.  Common sense\nwould dictate that you always provide updated information in response to the\ngovernment\u2019s inquiries on the application or the application would be of little value.  The\nsecurity clearance application is an important document that the Applicant swore\ncontained accurate information, when it did not.  The Applicant failed to present sufficient\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the above concerns.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n25.(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16. (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\n\n4\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fidiciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed\nin Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d                                              \n\n5\n  CONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse and/or dishonesty that demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the\nfinding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or\nmitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant\nhas engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H) and that he falsified his security\nclearance application (Guideline E).  The totality of this evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines H and E of the SOR.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant used marijuana for thirteen years from\n1994 to at least 2007.  He used marijuana knowing that it was prohibited by law and\nclearly prohibited by the Department of Defense.  His most recent use of marijuana\noccurred as recently as 2007.  Given his long history of marijuana use, and the use that\noccurred after he submitted his security clearance application, the Applicant has failed to\nprovide persuasive evidence that he has put his illegal drugs use behind him.  This\ndemonstrates poor judgment and untrustworthiness.  Under the particular facts of this\ncase, his use of marijuana in 2007 is considered recent in light of the fact that he\ncontinued using marijuana after completing his security clearance application, which\nprohibits a favorable determination in this case.       \nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions 25(a) any drug\nabuse, 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia, and 25(g) any illegal\ndrug use after being granted a security clearance apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable.  I find his past use of marijuana to be recent and of security\nsignificance.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline H, Drug\nInvolvement. \n\n6\nWith respect to the Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his marijuana use from 2003 to\n2006, on his 2006 security clearance application, I find that it was intentional.  There is\nno other plausible explanation for his conduct.\nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Condition 16(a) deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies.  None\nof the mitigating conditions are applicable.  I find that the Applicant deliberately falsified\nhis security clearance application by concealing his marijuana use.  Consequently, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 37 years old.  I have\nconsidered all of the evidence.  The fact remains, however, that he used marijuana for\nthirteen years, from 1994 to at least 2007.  He was not candid in response to questions\nconcerning his marijuana use and did not disclose this use on his 2006 security\nclearance application.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct\nset forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person\nassessment of poor judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of candor, an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is not trustworthy, and does not meet the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the\nApplicant under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and under Guideline E (Personal\nConduct).     \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.                                                  \n                                                                           \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n7\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He took no action\nto ensure that his foreign passport was surrendered before the close of record.\u201d  Second Remand Decision at 11.  \n3\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).\nIn his appeal of the Judge\u2019s original decision, Applicant points to three factual errors.  One\nis his job title.  That is a harmless error.  The second is the distance he traveled between job sites\nduring a particular period.  That is harmless error, particularly since the Judge ruled in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor as to the incident involved.  The third pertains to the Judge\u2019s characterization of the rules under\nwhich Applicant would travel to Israel if he no longer had an Israeli passport.  Applicant clarifies\nthe Judge\u2019s statement in this regard.  To the extent that the Judge\u2019s characterization is not clear, it\nis in error.  As explained below, the error is not harmful, since the clarification would be unlikely\nto change the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01105 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 15,\n2008). \nIn finding against Applicant under Guideline C, the Judge discussed Foreign Preference\nDisqualifying Condition (FCDC) 10(a),  noting that Applicant renewed his Israeli passport on at least\n1\ntwo occasions after becoming an American citizen.  Decision at 8.  The Judge then discussed the\nrelevant Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FCMC) 11(b)  and (e).   She explained that the\n2\n3\nrecord was held open for two weeks for Applicant to document that he had followed through on his\nstated intentions to begin the process of renouncing his Israeli passport and to surrender his passport\nto his FSO.  The Judge stated that at the close of the record Applicant still possessed a foreign\npassport.   The Judge\u2019s statement is sustainable.\n4\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\n\n4\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with national\nsecurity to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.\nSecond Remand Decision at 13.  See also Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)\n(\u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the\ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d). \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision to deny Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

Moody\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nDISSENTING OPINION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE MICHAEL Y. RA\u2019ANAN\nApplicant raises errors in the Judge\u2019s third decision which, at least cumulatively, are harmful:\nThe Judge\u2019s decision says: \u201cHe renewed his Israeli passport because he believes it was the\nonly way he could travel to Israel.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Actually, as Applicant  notes it is not merely his\nbelief, but it is Israeli law.  This  is confirmed by Government Administrative Notice Item II which\nsays: \u201cIsraeli citizens, including dual nationals, must enter and depart Israel on their Israeli passports,\nand Israeli authorities may require persons whom they consider to have acquired Israeli nationality\nat birth to obtain an Israeli passport prior to departing Israel.\u201d\nThe Judge\u2019s decision says: \u201cUnder cross-examination, Applicant admitted that he could\ntravel as a non-Israeli citizen to Israel.  He would have to wait in the non-Israeli citizen line while\narriving in the country.\u201d    Decision at 3.  That is not at all what Applicant testified to.  He testified\nthat after renouncing his Israeli citizenship he would be able to enter on the non-Israeli citizen line.\nTranscript 63-64.  Here again Applicant\u2019s testimony is confirmed by the language cited above from\nGovernment Administrative Notice II.\n\n5\nThe Judge\u2019s decision says: \u201cApplicant arranged for his children to obtain Israeli passports\nwhen they traveled to Israel in 2007.  They are U.S. citizens who were born in the U.S. and could\nhave used U.S. passports.  This action also indicates a preference for his home country.  While not\nalleged in the SOR under foreign preference, the Appeal Board had determined that even though\ncrucial security concerns are not alleged in the SOR, the Judge may consider those concerns when\nthey are relevant and factually related to a disqualifying condition that was alleged in the SOR.\u201d\nDecision at 8.  The Judge\u2019s premise is in error.  This was not a choice by Applicant (except to the\nextent that they did not have to make the trip).  His children could not use U.S. passports to enter and\nexit  Israel.  Again, the language from the Government\u2019s Administrative  Notice Item II is directly\non point as well as the following language from the same paragraph: \u201cIsraeli citizens naturalized in\nthe United States retain their Israeli citizenship and children born in the United States to Israeli\nparents usually acquire both U.S. and Israeli nationality at birth.\u201d\nFinally, the Judge\u2019s decision says: \u201cHis wife traveled to Israel on her U.S. passport and had\nto go through the line for non-Israeli citizens when entering Israel.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Applicant points\nto his explicit testimony that this was a unique circumstance for which Applicant\u2019s wife had obtained\nspecial permission in the form of a one-time letter from the Israeli government. Transcript  p. 17.\nThe Judge\u2019s first decision seemed to say that Applicant was cleared on all allegations but his\npossession of a foreign passport.  The cited errors were introduced after that decision was remanded\n(on a motion of both parties) to receive evidence that Applicant had surrendered the passport. The\nJudge\u2019s third decision relies in part on a credibility determination (which is not a substitute for\nevidence\u2014 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005)), presents Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony in a mistakenly harsh light and introduces his children\u2019s circumstances, also in a\nmistakenly harsh light.  On three of the four issues the Judge\u2019s description appears to be  refuted and\nthe Applicant\u2019s testimony  confirmed by a Government exhibit offered for Administrative Notice.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), on May 3, \n2007. On November 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nB, Foreign Influence; Guideline C, Foreign Preference; and Guideline M, Use of \nInformation Technology for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 3, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nJanuary 14, 2009. The case was assigned to me on January 23, 2009. On February 6, \n2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for February 24, 2009. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits \n(Gov) 1 - 5, which were admitted without objection. The Government requested that \nMarch 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadministrative notice be taken of one document with 15 attachments. The document \nwas marked as Hearing Exhibit I (Hearing Ex I) without objection. Applicant testified and \nsubmitted three exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 C without \nobjection. Applicant presented a typed copy of his opening and closing statements. This \nwas marked as Hearing Exhibit II. Applicant testified and called five witnesses on his \nbehalf. DOHA received the transcript of hearing on March 4, 2009. The record was held \nopen until March 10, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  No \nadditional documents were submitted. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy whose prime minister heads the government \nand exercises executive power. Israel has a diversified technologically advanced \neconomy that is growing at five percent annually. The United States is Israel\u2019s largest \ntrading partner. \n \nThe threat of terrorist attacks in Israel is an on-going concern. Terrorist \norganizations have launched rockets and mortars from the Gaza Strip. The U.S. \ngovernment has previously issued warnings that American interests could be the focus \nof such terrorist attacks. U.S. citizens, including tourists, students, residents, and U.S. \nmission personnel, have been injured or killed by terrorists while in Israel, the West \nBank and Gaza. As a result, American citizens have been urged to exercise a high \ndegree of caution when visiting places associated with U.S. interests and/or located \nnear U.S. official buildings.  \n \nThe U.S. and Israel have developed a close friendship based on common \ndemocratic values, religious affinities, and security interests. There are some issues in \nU.S. \u2013 Israeli relations. The U.S. is concerned with Israeli military sales to China, \ninadequate Israeli protection of U.S. intellectual property, and espionage-related cases \ninvolving Israeli citizens. \n \n (All sources for the above information are contained in Hearing Exhibit 1.)   \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 3, 2008, Applicant admits to all SOR \nallegations. \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old senior mechanical engineer employed with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer from 1985 to \n1992, and from 1996 to present. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical \nengineering. He is married and has four daughters, ages 29, 27 and 12 year-old twins. \nHe has held a SECRET clearance since 1985. (Tr at 7, 74-77; Gov 1)   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Israel. He moved to the United States in \nFebruary 1976. He completed his college education at a U.S. university. He attended \nthe first two years of college in Israel. He met his wife on a previous trip to the United \nStates. After a long distance courtship, they became engaged and he moved to the \nUnited States on a fianc\u00e9 visa. Applicant became a United States citizen on June 27, \n1980. (Tr at 48-49; Gov 1; Gov 2)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife moved with her family to the United States when she was four-\nyears-old. She became a U.S. citizen in 1968 and has continuously lived in the U.S. \nShe has no relatives living in Israel. All of their daughters were born and live in the U.S. \n(Tr at 74-77) His wife is a dual citizen of Israel and the U.S. by virtue of her birth in \nIsrael. His children are considered dual citizens of Israel and the U.S. by virtue of their \nparents\u2019 Israeli citizenship.  Prior to traveling to Israel to visit family in June 2007, the \nentire family applied for Israeli passports. The Israeli Consulate did not issue his wife a \npassport. Applicant is not sure why but thinks it was because she lived in the U.S. for \nsuch a lengthy period of time and never applied for an Israeli passport. Applicant and \nhis children were each issued Israeli passports. They used the passports only to travel \nto Israel.  His wife traveled to Israel on her U.S. passport and had to go through the line \nfor non-Israeli citizens when entering Israel. (Tr at 17, 45-46, 56)     \n \nApplicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Israel.  He possesses a valid Israeli \npassport. It was issued on March 12, 2007, and does not expire until March 11, 2017. \nHe held a previous Israeli passport which was issued on June 19, 1996, and expired on \nJune 18, 2001.  He renewed his Israeli passport because he believes it was the only \nway he could travel to Israel. (Tr at 52-53, 72) Applicant has a valid U.S. passport. \nUnder cross-examination, Applicant admitted that he could travel as a non-Israeli citizen \nto Israel. He would have to wait in the non-Israeli citizen line while arriving in the \ncountry. (Tr at 64) \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant and his family traveled to Israel on a two-week \nsightseeing tour. In October 2000, he traveled to Israel alone to visit family, staying for \napproximately 10 days. In the past, Applicant\u2019s employer sent him to Israel on business \ntrips. His employer had a partnership with an Israeli defense company to develop a \nmissile for the U.S. Air Force. Applicant traveled to Israel on company business from \nJune 1996 to December 1996, from October 2001 to December 2001, and for one week \nin July 2003. (Tr at 44-47, 89; Gov 3) \n \nNeither Applicant nor his wife and children receive benefits from Israel. He has \nno investments in Israel. He owns a home in the U.S. and all of his investments are \nlocated in the U.S. (Tr at 20, 72-73, 89; Gov 3; Gov 4) \n \nAt hearing, Applicant stated he is willing to renounce his Israeli citizenship and \nsurrender his Israeli passport. Prior to the hearing, he inquired about the process at the \nIsraeli consulate. They informed him that it would take approximately one year.  \nApplicant believes that he cannot surrender his Israeli passport to the Israeli Consulate \nuntil after the renunciation of his Israeli citizenship is complete. Applicant had not \n\n \n4 \n \n \nstarted proceedings to renounce his Israeli citizenship and/or surrender his Israeli \npassport prior to the hearing. He was willing to surrender his Israeli passport to the \ncompany Facility Security Officer (FSO) during the process of the revocation of his \nIsraeli citizenship. (Tr at 18, 21, 58-68) \n \n Applicant is concerned that he may need his Israeli passport to visit his mother \nshould she become ill. If something should happen to his mother, he may ask the FSO \nto have his passport returned to him. He intended to surrender his passport to the FSO \nthe following week.  He claims the FSO told him that in other cases, applicants \nsurrendered their foreign passports to him and the passport was physically destroyed.  \nThe FSO apparently stated that he could not destroy Applicant\u2019s Israeli passport \nbecause it is the property of the Israeli government. The FSO did not testify about the \npassport issue at hearing. The record was held open for two weeks, to allow Applicant \nto submit evidence that he gave his passport to the FSO and that he started the process \nto renounce his Israeli citizenship. Applicant did not submit additional evidence after the \nhearing. (Tr at 18, 21, 59-68) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and two brothers are citizens of and reside in Israel. His \nmother is 85 and in poor health.  She is a Holocaust survivor. She was a housewife. \nShe owns her home and lives on payments from the Israeli government. She also \nreceives reparation payments from the German government. His father died at age 55. \n(Tr at 74, 78-79; Gov 3) He telephones his mother every two to three weeks. (Tr at 85)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s older brother is 62. He is retired from an Israeli defense contractor. \nHis employer is the same Israeli defense contractor that Applicant\u2019s company entered \ninto a joint partnership several years ago. Applicant is not exactly sure what his \nbrother\u2019s job title was but believes he was a technician in the defense procurement area \nworking with suppliers and vendors. He occasionally does consulting work for his former \nemployer. He talks to his brother every one to two weeks. (Tr at 81-85) \n \nApplicant\u2019s twin brother is in poor health. He works as a carpenter. He is married \nand has a daughter. He talks to his twin brother every two to three weeks. (Tr at 80-81, \n85) Because of his medical condition, Applicant\u2019s mother has designated his twin \nbrother as the sole beneficiary of his mother\u2019s property when she passes away. (Tr at \n73-74)   \n \nApplicant has other extended relatives who are citizens of and reside in Israel. \nApplicant does not believe any of his relatives have worked for the Israeli government, \naside from the mandatory military service. (Tr at 86-87) Applicant also communicates \nwith three Israeli citizens who he befriended when he worked on the joint venture with \nhis employer and the Israeli defense contractor. (Tr at 87-88)   \n \n Applicant served in the Israeli military when he was younger. He was a radio \ncommunication expert and was discharged after three years at the rank of Sergeant. He \nno longer has contact with anyone who he served in the Israeli military. He has never \nworked for the Israeli government. (Tr at 50-51; Gov 4) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nIn December 2004, Applicant\u2019s work computer was searched in relation to \nanother investigation involving an individual who was sending inappropriate chain e-mail \nto other company employees. A high quantity of the e-mail containing inappropriate  \nchain e-mails, videos displaying female nudity, political humor, and jokes were \ndiscovered on Applicant\u2019s computer.  The investigation revealed that Applicant violated \nseveral company policies involving the use of company assets, e-mail use and Internet \nand Intranet usage. On January 15, 2005, Applicant was suspended without pay for 30 \ndays for the inappropriate use of his company computer. (Gov 3; Gov 5; AE E) \n \nApplicant disputes the company\u2019s account of what transpired. During the period \nof time when this occurred, he was traveling daily to another company work location that \nwas over 90 miles away. A retired employee sent him a lot of e-mails. Applicant would \nsave the e-mails to read later but never got a chance to read and/or delete them \nbecause he was too busy. He never forwarded the inappropriate e-mails to other \npeople. He learned a valuable lesson. He now reads his e-mail daily and deletes every \ne-mail that is sent to him by third parties that might be considered inappropriate. He tells \nhis friends not to send him any non-work related e-mails to his company account. (Tr at \n91-99; Gov 3) No subsequent incidents have occurred involving Applicant.   \n \nFive co-workers and/or supervisors testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf at the hearing. \nThey all referred to him as a hard worker who provides for his family. They described \nhim as \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d \u201chonest,\u201d and \u201cpositive.\u201d (Tr at 99 \u2013 134) Four additional co-\nworkers also wrote reference letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf attesting to his favorable \ncharacter and work ethic. (AE D) He has received several special recognition awards. \n(AE A; AE B) His performance reviews indicate that he is a valued employee. (AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(c) (contact with a family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion) applies because Applicant\u2019s mother and two brothers are citizens of and \nreside in Israel. \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, \ngroup or country by providing that information) applies for the same reason.  Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his family members in Israel create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween his obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and his desire to \nhelp his family members residing in Israel.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Influence. The following Foreign Influence Mitigating \nConditions (FI MC) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest) applies.  While Applicant has a close relationship with his relatives \nwho reside in Israel, the people he is closest to, his wife and four children, reside in the \nU.S. Applicant has lived in the U.S. for over 33 years. He became a U.S. citizen in 1982. \nHe completed his college education in the U.S. He has worked for U.S. defense \ncontractors for most of his career. He has held a SECRET security clearance since \n1985 with no apparent security violations. The majority of his significant personal and \nprofessional associates are located in the U.S. He owns no property and has no \ninvestments in Israel. \n \nApplicant\u2019s closest family ties, professional ties, and assets are located in the \nU.S.  His deep and longstanding relationships in the U.S. support the premise that he \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \n \nFor these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the concerns raised under \nForeign Influence.  \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG &9:       \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.    \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC)10(a) (exercise of any \nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or \nthrough foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport); and FP DC \u00b6 10(b) (action to acquire or \nobtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen) apply. Applicant \nrenewed his Israeli passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. The record evidence \nindicates Applicant renewed his Israeli passport on June 19, 1996. This passport \nexpired on June 18, 2001. He renewed his Israeli passport on March 12, 2007. The \npassport does not expire until March 11, 2017. It is not clear whether there were times \nthat Applicant let his Israeli passport lapse after becoming a U.S. citizen or whether he \nrenewed the passport on other occasions. He renewed his Israeli passport in order to \ntravel to Israel. He believed that the only way he could travel to Israel was through the \nuse of an Israeli passport because he is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Israel. \nRegardless, renewing a foreign passport after becoming a U.S. citizen is considered an \nexercise of foreign citizenship.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Preference. The following Foreign Preference Mitigating \nConditions (FP MC)potentially apply: \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship)  \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated) \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant expressed his intent to renounce his Israeli \ncitizenship and to surrender his Israeli passport. Prior to the hearing, he consulted with \nhis FSO and the Israeli Consulate to inquire about the process of renouncing his Israeli \ncitizenship and surrendering his passport. There was a lot of discussion during the \nhearing about Applicant\u2019s possession of a valid passport. Applicant\u2019s intention was to \nbegin the process of renouncing his Israeli citizenship after the hearing. He would \nsurrender his Israeli passport to his FSO until he was required to submit the passport to \nthe Israeli Consulate upon completion of the renunciation process. The record was held \nopen to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit proof that he followed through with his \nintended actions. Nothing was offered after the hearing. As such, FP MC \u00b6 11(e) does \nnot apply. At the close of the record, Applicant still possessed a valid foreign passport. \nThis remains a security concern. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Use of Information \nTechnology Systems is set out in AG \u00b6 39 which states, \u201cNoncompliance with rules, \nprocedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to information technology systems may \nraise security concerns about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into \nquestion the willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer hardware, \nsoftware, firmware, and data used for the communication, transmission, processing, \nmanipulation, storage, or protection of information.\u201d \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply under Guideline M (M DC) in \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \n \nM DC \u00b6 40(e) (unauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem) \n \n \nM DC \u00b6 40(f) (introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, \nsoftware, or media to or from any information technology system without authorization, \nwhen prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations) \n \n \nWhile Applicant disputes some of his company\u2019s conclusions pertaining to this \nincident, numerous inappropriate e-mail files were found on his company computer.  \nThe e-mails violated company policies which resulted in Applicant\u2019s 30-day suspension. \n \n \nHowever, the issues pertaining to Use of Information Technology Systems can \nbe mitigated (M MC).  \n \n \nM MC \u00b6 41(a) (so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies to \nApplicant\u2019s case.  More than three years have passed since this incident. Since that \ntime, Applicant has not been involved in any similar incidents. I considered that the \ninappropriate e-mails were sent to Applicant from third parties. He did not forward the e-\nmails. Applicant now takes precautions to make sure all of the incoming e-mails he \nreceives are within company guidelines. He immediately deletes the e-mails that appear \nto be inappropriate. He told his friends to no longer send personal e-mails to his work \ncomputer. It is unlikely Applicant will be involved in similar conduct in the future.  \n \n \nApplicant mitigated the Guideline M concern.  \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \n\n \n10 \n \n \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. as well his relationship with his mother and two brothers who are citizens of and \nreside in Israel. I considered the favorable comments from Applicant\u2019s current and \nformer co-workers. After evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant mitigated the concerns under foreign influence and use of \ninformation technology. Although Applicant expressed a willingness to renounce his \nIsraeli citizenship and surrender his foreign passport during the hearing, he was given \ntwo weeks after the hearing to provide proof that he followed through with his intentions. \nHe did not submit any proof.  The evidence shows that Applicant still possessed a valid \nforeign passport. He has not mitigated the concerns raised under foreign preference. \nClearance is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not  \nclearly consistent with national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nRemand Decision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), on May 3, \n2007. On November 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nB, Foreign Influence; Guideline C, Foreign Preference; and Guideline M, Use of \nInformation Technology. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 3, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nJanuary 14, 2009. The case was assigned to me on January 23, 2009. On February 6, \n2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for February 24, 2009. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits \n(Gov) 1 - 5, which were admitted without objection. The Government requested that \nadministrative notice be taken of one document with 15 attachments. The document \nMay 6, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwas marked as Hearing Exhibit I (Hearing Ex I) without objection. Applicant testified and \nsubmitted three exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 C without \nobjection. Applicant presented a typed copy of his opening and closing statements. \n(Hearing Exhibit II) Applicant testified and called five witnesses on his behalf. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of hearing on March 4, 2009. The record was held open until \nMarch 10, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  No additional \ndocuments were submitted. \n \n \nI issued a decision on March 24, 2009. I found that Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline M, Use of \nInformation Technology. I found he did not mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference, and I concluded it was not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \n \n \nOn April 1, 2009, Applicant appealed my decision, providing evidence that was \nnot provided before the close of the record.  Department Counsel filed a response to \nApplicant\u2019s appeal stating that under the facts of the case an expedited remand would \nbe the equitable resolution to put the pertinent evidence before the Administrative \nJudge. On April 16, 2009, the Appeal Board remanded the case for further processing \nbased on the additional evidence submitted by Applicant in his appeal. The additional \nevidence is a two-page document marked as AE D. Based on a review of the case file, \npleadings, testimony, and exhibits, including the exhibit submitted by Applicant with his \nappeal, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe security concerns raised under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems are not addressed in this remand \ndecision because the concerns were mitigated in my previous decision, dated March 24, \n2009.  \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old senior mechanical engineer employed with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer from 1985 to \n1992, and from 1996 to present. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical \nengineering. He is married and has four daughters, ages 29, 27 and 12 year-old twins. \nHe has held a SECRET clearance since 1985. (Tr at 7, 74-77; Gov 1)   \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Israel. He moved to the United States in \nFebruary 1976. He completed his college education at a U.S. university. He attended \nthe first two years of college in Israel. He met his wife on a previous trip to the United \nStates. After a long distance courtship, they became engaged and he moved to the \nUnited States on a fianc\u00e9 visa. Applicant became a United States citizen on June 27, \n1980. (Tr at 48-49; Gov 1; Gov 2)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife moved with her family to the United States when she was four \nyears old. She became a U.S. citizen in 1968 and has continuously lived in the U.S. She \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhas no relatives living in Israel. All of their daughters were born and live in the U.S. (Tr \nat 74-77) His wife is a dual citizen of Israel and the U.S. by virtue of her birth in Israel. \nHis children are considered dual citizens of Israel and the U.S. by virtue of their parents\u2019 \nIsraeli citizenship.  Prior to traveling to Israel to visit family in June 2007, the entire \nfamily applied for Israeli passports. The Israeli Consulate did not issue his wife a \npassport. Applicant is not sure why but thinks it was because she lived in the U.S. for \nsuch a lengthy period of time and never applied for an Israeli passport. Applicant and \nhis children were each issued Israeli passports. They used the passports only to travel \nto Israel.  His wife traveled to Israel on her U.S. passport and had to go through the line \nfor non-Israeli citizens when entering Israel. (Tr at 17, 45-46, 56)     \n \nApplicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Israel.  He possesses a valid Israeli \npassport. It was issued on March 12, 2007, and does not expire until March 11, 2017. \nHe held a previous Israeli passport which was issued on June 19, 1996, and expired on \nJune 18, 2001.  He renewed his Israeli passport because he believes it was the only \nway he could travel to Israel. (Tr at 52-53, 72) Applicant has a valid U.S. passport. \nUnder cross-examination, Applicant admitted that he could travel as a non-Israeli citizen \nto Israel. He would have to wait in the non-Israeli citizen line while arriving in the \ncountry. (Tr at 64) \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant and his family traveled to Israel on a two-week \nsightseeing tour. In October 2000, he traveled to Israel alone to visit family, staying for \napproximately 10 days. In the past, Applicant\u2019s employer sent him to Israel on business \ntrips. His employer had a partnership with an Israeli defense company to develop a \nmissile for the U.S. Air Force. Applicant traveled to Israel on company business from \nJune 1996 to December 1996, from October 2001 to December 2001, and for one week \nin July 2003. (Tr at 44-47, 89; Gov 3) \n \nNeither Applicant nor his wife and children receive benefits from Israel. He has \nno investments in Israel. He owns a home in the U.S. and all of his investments are \nlocated in the U.S. (Tr at 20, 72-73, 89; Gov 3; Gov 4) \n \nAt hearing, Applicant stated that he is willing to renounce his Israeli citizenship \nand surrender his Israeli passport. Prior to the hearing, he inquired about the process at \nthe Israeli consulate. They informed him that it would take approximately one year.  \nApplicant believes that he cannot surrender his Israeli passport to the Israeli Consulate \nuntil after the renunciation of his Israeli citizenship is complete. Applicant had not \nstarted proceedings to renounce his Israeli citizenship and/or surrender his Israeli \npassport prior to the hearing. He was willing to surrender his Israeli passport to the \ncompany Facility Security Officer (FSO) pending the process of the renouncing his \nIsraeli citizenship. (Tr at 18, 21, 58-68) \n \n Applicant is concerned that he may need his Israeli passport to visit his mother \nshould she become ill. If something should happen to his mother, he may ask the FSO \nto have his Israeli passport returned to him in order to travel to Israel to visit his mother. \nHe was advised on several occasions during the hearing that if he does so it will raise a \n\n \n4 \n \n \nsecurity issue and could result in the revocation of his security clearance. (Tr at 61-62, \n64-65, 67, 150)    \n \nApplicant testified that he would surrender his Israeli passport to the FSO within \na week of the hearing. (Tr at 62) He claims the FSO told him that in other cases, \napplicants surrendered their foreign passports to the FSO and the passport was \nphysically destroyed. The FSO apparently stated that he could not destroy Applicant\u2019s \nIsraeli passport because it is the property of the Israeli government. Applicant was not \nwilling to destroy his Israeli passport for this same reason. The FSO did not testify about \nthe passport issue at hearing. (Tr at 66-67)  \n \nThe record was held open for two weeks, to allow Applicant to submit evidence \nthat he surrendered his Israeli passport to his FSO and documentation that he started \nthe process to renounce his Israeli citizenship. I advised Applicant that if he needed \nadditional time to contact Department Counsel to request a delay. Department Counsel \nwould inform me of the request and an additional delay would likely be granted. (Tr at \n64, 149 - 150) \n \nAt the end of the hearing, Applicant asked, \u201cSo you want me to start the process \nto surrender my passport to [name of FSO], he\u2019s the security manager at Lockheed \nMartin?\u201d (Tr at 149) He was told \u201cyes\u201d and told to have the FSO prepare an affidavit \nverifying that Applicant surrendered his Israeli passport to the FSO which Applicant \ncould submit as proof of the surrender of his passport. Department Counsel advised the \nApplicant that if the FSO was looking for a standard format to contact Department \nCounsel and he would provide a sample memorandum. (Tr at 149-150) \n \nNo additional documents were submitted during the two week period the record \nwas left open.  I contacted Department Counsel at the close of the record to inquire \nwhether Applicant had contacted Department Counsel and/or submitted anything. \nApplicant had not contacted Department Counsel.  \n \nApplicant claims in his appeal, dated April 1, 2009, that there was a \nmiscommunication between him and his security department. He claims that in similar \ncases the court has forwarded a letter of instruction at the completion of the case which \nprovides direction to the security office. His security office thought such a letter would \nbe forthcoming with instructions. He claims that he did not understand that the \ndirections provided at the hearing were all that would take place. He attached a letter \nfrom his FSO which verified that he surrendered his valid Israeli passport to the FSO on \nApril 1, 2009. (AE D) \n \nFive co-workers and/or supervisors testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf at the hearing. \nThey all referred to him as a hard worker who provides for his family. They described \nhim as \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d \u201chonest,\u201d and \u201cpositive.\u201d (Tr at 99 \u2013 134) Four additional co-\nworkers also wrote reference letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf attesting to his favorable \ncharacter and work ethic. (AE D) He has received several special recognition awards. \n(AE A; AE B) His performance reviews indicate that he is a valued employee. (AE C) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe concerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline M, Use of \nInformation Technology Systems, will not be addressed because they were not the \nbasis for the remand decision.  \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG &9:       \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.    \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC)10(a) (exercise of any \nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or \nthrough foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport); and FP DC \u00b6 10(b) (action to acquire or \nobtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen) apply. Applicant \nrenewed his Israeli passport after becoming a U.S. citizen on June 27, 1980. The record \nevidence indicates Applicant renewed his Israeli passport on June 19, 1996. This \npassport expired on June 18, 2001. He also renewed his Israeli passport on March 12, \n2007. The passport does not expire until March 11, 2017.  Applicant was entitled to an \nIsraeli passport by virtue of his status as an Israeli citizen.  His renewal of his Israeli \npassport and his use of his Israeli passport to travel to and from Israel is an exercise of \nforeign citizenship.  \n \nApplicant arranged for his children to obtain Israeli passports when they traveled \nto Israel in 2007. They were born in the U.S. and could have used U.S. passports. This \naction also indicates a preference for his home country. While not alleged in the SOR \nunder foreign preference, the Appeal Board has determined that even though crucial \nsecurity concerns are not alleged in the SOR, the Judge may consider those security \nconcerns when they are relevant and factually related to a disqualifying condition that \nwas alleged in the SOR. ISCR 05-01820 at 3 n.4 (App. Bd. December 14, 2006) (citing \nISCR Case No. 01-18860 at 8 (App. Bd. March 17, 2003) and ISCR Case No. 02-00305 \nat 4 (App. Bd. February 12, 2003)).  \n \nSince Applicant admitted the SOR allegations and the government produced \nsubstantial evidence by way of exhibits to raise disqualifying conditions FP DC \u00b6 10(a) \nand FP DC \u00b6 10(b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15). An applicant \nhas the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never \n\n \n7 \n \n \nshifts to the government (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (DOHA Appeal Board \nDecision, September 22, 2005)). \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Preference. \n \nForeign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is \nbased solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country) does not apply. While \nApplicant was born and raised in Israel, he continued to exercise his Israeli citizenship \nafter becoming a U.S. citizen.  He renewed his Israeli passport on several occasions \nand used it to travel to and from Israel. His application for and use of a foreign passport \nafter becoming a U.S. was an exercise of dual citizenship and reveals a continued \npreference for his home country. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship) applies. Applicant testified that he intended to renounce his Israeli \ncitizenship. He testified that he contacted the Israeli consulate about the steps required \nto renounce his Israeli citizenship but had not started the process to renounce his Israeli \ncitizenship.  FP MC \u00b6 11(b) is given less weight because while Applicant expressed an \nintention to renounce his Israeli citizenship during the hearing, he also expressed a \nconcern that he may need his Israeli passport in the future to travel to Israel to visit his \nmother.  \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11 ( c) (exercise of rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a \nminor) does not apply. Applicant exercised his Israeli citizenship after becoming a U.S. \nHe was an adult when he became a U.S. citizen. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11 (d) (use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority) does not apply to the facts of this case. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated) applies because Applicant surrendered his \ncurrent Israeli passport to his FSO on April 1, 2009, approximately one week after the  \ndecision was issued denying his access to classified information.  \n \nI give this FP MC \u00b6 11(e) little weight for the following reasons. Applicant was put \non notice on November 14, 2008, when he was served the SOR that possession of a \nvalid foreign passport was a security issue under Guideline C. He was provided a copy \nof the Directive with his SOR. The Directive lists the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline C. He was on notice as to what steps to take to mitigate the \nconcerns raised under foreign preference. He took no steps to mitigate this issue prior \nto his hearing which occurred on February 24, 2009.  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant expressed his intent to surrender his valid foreign passport to \nhis FSO during the hearing, it was clear he had reservations about surrendering his \n\n \n8 \n \n \nIsraeli passport. He testified that he may need to ask his FSO to return his Israeli \npassport in the future in order to visit his mother. He said he would surrender his valid \nIsraeli passport within the next week. He delayed taking any steps to do so until after \nthe record was closed and an adverse decision was issued. His actions to do not \nindicate a good-faith effort to mitigate the security concerns raised under foreign \npreference.  \n \n \nApplicant was provided sufficient instructions at the hearing on what needed to \nbe done to show proof of surrender of his foreign passport to his FSO. He was advised \nif he needed additional time, he could submit a request for an extension of time. \nAlthough not required to, Department Counsel advised Applicant to call him if he \nneeded a sample memorandum for his FSO to use to verify the surrender of his foreign \npassport. At hearing, Applicant was never told that the government would provide his \nsecurity office a letter of instruction pertaining to the passport issue. The burden was \nalways on Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised pertaining to his \npossession of a valid foreign passport. Considering the extensive instructions provided \nto Applicant during the hearing, his assertion in his appeal that he was awaiting further \ninstructions from the government is not credible.   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s renewal, possession and use of an Israeli foreign passport over a \nnumber of years after becoming a U.S. citizen indicates that he still has a preference for \na foreign country. Although not alleged in the SOR under Guideline C, the fact that he \narranged for his family to obtain Israeli passports prior to traveling to Israel in 2007, \nreinforces his preference for his home country. Although he eventually surrendered his \nvalid foreign passport to his FSO, his expressed reluctance to do so at hearing, his \nstatement that he may need to ask for it back in the future if he needs to visit his \nmother, and his extensive delay in taking action to surrender his foreign passport does \nnot mitigate the foreign preference security concern. Security concerns under foreign \npreference are not mitigated.  \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. as well his relationship with his mother and two brothers who are citizens of and \nreside in Israel. I considered Applicant\u2019s work history and the favorable testimony from \nApplicant\u2019s current and former co-workers.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s explanation to the Appeal Board as to why he did not \nsurrender his Israeli passport prior to the close of the record. The record evidence \ncontradicts his assertions and I do not find his excuse credible.  \n \nApplicant had ample time prior to the hearing to address concerns related to his \npossession of a valid foreign passport. He did not do so but professed at hearing that he \nintended to do so within a week following the hearing. The record was held open for two \nweeks to allow him the opportunity to do so. Applicant had the burden to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline C involving the possession of a valid foreign \npassport. He ignored the instructions provided to him at hearing and did nothing during \nthe two weeks the record was held open. After he received the decision denying his \nsecurity clearance, he blamed the government and his security office while he took no \naction to ensure that his foreign passport was surrendered before the close of the \nrecord. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing conduct raises questions about his reliability, integrity,  \ntrustworthiness, and his ability to follow rules and regulations.  \n \nApplicant ultimately surrendered his valid foreign passport to his security office \nbut only after his security clearance was denied. Considering his testimony at hearing \nthat he may ask for it back in the future, it was not an unqualified surrender of his \nforeign passport. Doubts remain under the foreign preference concern. Clearance is \ndenied.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not  \nclearly consistent with national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",
